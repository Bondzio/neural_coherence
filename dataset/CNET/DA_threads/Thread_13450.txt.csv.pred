1.1.1	I do not remember if I asked on here about this.	St
1.1.2	So, I'm going to see if I can get better assistance.	St
1.1.3	I've asked on other forums, but could not get a clear understanding/decision, etc.	St
1.1.4	I have a Compaq Presario S4020WM with everything the same.	St
1.1.5	The only thing was, I upgraded to a Gig of RAM recently.	St
1.1.6	At the same time of upgrading the RAM, the power supply died.	St
1.1.7	A man with his shop at a flea market replaced the power supply.	St
1.1.8	The power supply was and still is a disaster.	St
1.1.9	I have to leave the computer case open and keep a tower fan blowing into it, so my computer does not freeze.	St
1.1.10	I have people telling me that the power supply is too strong - 450w.	St
1.1.11	The max for this computer is 250w.	St
1.1.12	I have people telling me that it is not even the wattage and that it is a cheap non-brand-name power supply that does not handle the current or whatever correctly.	St
1.1.13	So, I need to know, what is the brand name?	St
1.1.14	I found a power supply that should be a match for my computer, but the price is cheap.	St
1.1.15	Is it a non-brand-name or what?	St
1.1.16	http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=935375&CatId=1076 As for the hard drive, I am wanting to upgrade.	St
1.1.17	I'm still having a hard time to choose one.	St
1.1.18	It seem Seagate is more reliable, according to the reviews I've read.	St
1.1.19	Western Digital is good, if it is the lucky hard drive.	St
1.1.20	I recently found out that my hard drive is a Western Digital and it is about 4 years old now.	St
1.1.21	It runs on 24/7 and still working just great.	St
1.1.22	I know that the motherboard has a limit.	St
1.1.23	Right?	St
1.1.24	Of course, I can only limit the RAM to 1 Gig.	St
1.1.25	Well, I have people telling me that there is no limit as to how big hard drive I can get.	St
1.1.26	I have people telling me that there is a limit and that the system would not pick up on full hard drive space or whatever the term is.	St
1.1.27	I have Compaq telling me the max is 120 Gigs and then the next time told me 160 Gigs.	St
1.1.28	I'm torn apart over this.	Polite
1.1.29	I've looked everywhere and trying to decide.	St
1.1.30	Now, I just had someone telling me that I can keep my 40 Gigs hard drive and use the new one as slave.	St
1.1.31	Well, the new one will be much bigger than the 40, so I would like for it to be the main.	St
1.1.32	If I can make the 40 Gigs as slave, then how can I do that exactly?	St
1.1.33	The 40 has XP on it, so how do I wipe everything off clean?	St
1.1.34	I'm going to put XP on the bigger and newer hard drive.	St
1.1.35	I may or may not use the 40 as the slave.	St
1.1.36	Or, should I leave everything alone on the 40 and set my computer to boot up from the new drive?	Sug
1.1.37	There is so much that I want to be clear on.	St
1.1.38	I've had good experience on this forum.	St
1.1.39	Please, help me.	St
1.1.40	Be prepared for multiple questions, if I am still not able to understand or decide.	St
1.1.41	Thunder	St
1.2.1	I was told the hard drive need to be IDE PATA.	St
1.2.2	Newegg does not have this.	St
1.2.3	Tiger Direct does.	St
1.2.4	200 Gigs http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=715427&CatId=523 250 Gigs http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2205144&CatId=134 There are some that has much higher Gigs, but it says OEM.	St
1.2.5	If I am correct, it does not include anything with it, so I do not know what to get.	St
1.2.6	Thunder	St
1.3.1	Can anyone help me?	Ques
1.3.2	I'm wanting to upgrade as fast as I can, please.	St
1.3.3	Should I move it to another section?	St
1.3.4	Thunder	St
1.4.1	Folks may not want to comment on this because they sense a &quot;can of worms&quot;.	St
1.4.2	The psu supplies as much power as the machine needs up to the limit of the psu.	St
1.4.3	Ex.	St
1.4.4	The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 250w psu&gt;works fine.	St
1.4.5	The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 400w psu&gt;works fine.	St
1.4.6	The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 600w psu&gt;works fine.	St
1.4.7	The machine needs 200w&gt;you have a 150w psu&gt;does not work.	St
1.4.8	If it was me...I'd work at making the machine stable in its current config before upgrading/introducing new parts.	St
1.4.9	Bench time.......	St
1.5.1	What is &quot;can of worms&quot;?	St
1.5.2	Well, the machine is stable, as long the tower fan is blowing cooler air into the computer.	St
1.5.3	So, it is the Power Supply.	St
1.5.4	I'm going to get another one that manages power efficiently, because this one heating up the system.	St
1.5.5	When the tower fan is turned off, the computer heats up and freeze.	St
1.5.6	I'm going to get a Power Supply at the same time I get a Hard Drive.	St
1.5.7	Be graceful if someone have the patience to work with me on the issue of choosing the good brand-name Power Supply and the Hard Drive.	St
1.5.8	Thunder	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Since you want to press on, I will give you another suggestion.	St
1.7.2	The HDD you listed should be an easy fit into your computer but I would not set it up as the master, but as a slave till you see it works correctly (in most cases, you will need to set jumpers on the drive to do this).	St
1.7.3	Then once you have it working you can set it up as the master drive ( making it the master drive may require the original restore disks, do you have them?).	St
1.7.4	However, I recommend buying an external USB drive.	St
1.7.5	That way if replacing the PSU with what you selected does not fix the over heating problem you can at least move the drive to another XP computer easily.	St
1.7.6	Most external HDDs have their own power supply so it should not tax your systems lower power PSU you are planning to install.	St
1.7.7	The over heating problem needs to be looked into.	St
1.7.8	Your current fix is working but I have found that most heat problems get worse with time.	St
1.7.9	Here are just a few things to check into and learn about.	St
1.7.10	1.)	St
1.7.11	You may find you need to replace the thermal grease which allows for cooling the CPU, your computer is aging and this is one of the things that I replace to keep an older PC going.	St
1.7.12	2.)	St
1.7.13	You may find the CPU fan and heat sink need cleaning.	St
1.7.14	The fan may need to be replaced, they wear out.	St
1.7.15	3.)	St
1.7.16	There are software programs you can get that monitor temperature and fan speed, some BIOSs come with this feature built in.	St
1.7.17	Compaqs I own dont have it so you may have to get a program to do this.	St
1.7.18	All the above can be searched on within Cnets forums and reviews.	St
1.7.19	Try searching over heating, thermal grease, fan speed, and other keywords when you have a question.	St
1.7.20	I have often found good replies for just what Im looking for which saved me time from posting for info that has been done before.	St
1.7.21	I looked at the Compaq Presario S4020WM spec page at HPs site and I find the system to be some what dated.	St
1.7.22	I find older system to good for limited tasks but dont expect to be able to turn this computer into a high speed gamer or run Vista Premium.	St
1.7.23	For example it only has a 4x AGP slot for video card upgrading, has no SATA HDD upgrading, and only can handle 1 MB of RAM.	St
1.7.24	So what are you planning to use this computer for once you upgrade it?	Ques
1.8.1	Before I attempted to upgrade the RAM, everything was working fine.	St
1.8.2	As soon I unplugged the computer to upgrade the RAM, that is when I discovered the power supply died.	St
1.8.3	This replaced power supply, ever since I got this one, computer starts to heat up and freeze.	St
1.8.4	I use Everant program to monitor the temperature and the CPU.	St
1.8.5	I notice it would heat up without the tower fan blowing into computer.	St
1.8.6	When I keep the tower fan on, the temperature stays cool.	St
1.8.7	The CPU fan is working.	St
1.8.8	So, that is the only thing, ever since the power supply replacement, this happens.	St
1.8.9	I will have the CPU checked by a local computer store.	St
1.8.10	The other guy said that my CPU is fine and that everything is clean and working.	St
1.8.11	I'll have another store to check the CPU.	St
1.8.12	I'm going to order the hard drive I listed, hopefully Tiger Direct will friggin approve.	St
1.8.13	I seem to have problem ordering from there.	St
1.8.14	I wish Newegg have it, because I order from there easily.	St
1.8.15	If I have the new hard drive set up as slave and it all works fine, can I change the new hard drive to Master C on my own at home without going into the computer and switching them?	St
1.8.16	I am planning to be a DJ for an online radio station, so I am going to get at least 80 Gigs of songs.	St
1.8.17	I'm not a heavy gamer.	St
1.8.18	LoL A gig of RAM is enough for me.	St
1.8.19	Thunder	St
1.9.1	Someone told me to get a brand-name.	St
1.9.2	Is this a good one?	Polite
1.9.3	http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=935375&CatId=1076 Thunder	St
1.10.1	The machine was working.	St
1.10.2	You upgrade the ram.	St
1.10.3	The psu dies&gt;hmmmm.	St
1.10.4	You replace the psu.	St
1.10.5	Now the machine overheats&gt;hmmmm.	St
1.10.6	You can do what you want.	St
1.10.7	I'd have the machine on my work bench.	St
1.10.8	I'd want to know why.	St
1.10.9	The machine should function with the cover on.	Sug
1.10.10	If it does not and you upgrade/add parts&gt;well your business.	St
1.11.1	Just make sure it has the correct pin/power connectors so it will plug into your motherboard.	Sug
1.11.2	No point in getting it if it won't plug into the motherboard.	St
1.11.3	If you have the old PSU (the original one) make sure this new one has the same connector setup or can be used with only the connectors that are needed.	St
1.11.4	PSU have changed in just the last few years.	St
1.11.5	Which makes buying harder because they are not all backwards compatible.	St
1.11.6	The goal of the company selling the computer (in your case Compaq)is to keep cost low and one way they do this is by using a small/weak power supply.	St
1.11.7	They select the power supply size by what the power consumption specs of the parts it is sold with use.	St
1.11.8	The computer will usually work until you upgrade with a power hungry video card, additional hard drives or maybe even just adding more RAM.	St
1.11.9	This is why when most people upgrade a computer, a higher wattage PSU is chosen.	St
1.11.10	In your case at least try and make sure it will fit connector wise.	St
1.11.11	Sometimes just trying things can lead to a success, good luck.	St
1.12.1	I just saw this post.	St
1.12.2	Missed it.	St
1.12.3	I guess the power supply was about to go out.	St
1.12.4	As soon I unplugged, it completely died, because it was used 24/7 for 4 years.	St
1.12.5	I'll post update when the new power supply and hard drive comes in.	St
1.12.6	Also, I want to note, I put the previous RAM sticks back in to test it with this power supply...	St
1.12.7	Same problem.	St
1.12.8	It is clearly the power supply.	St
1.12.9	Anyways, I'll post update soon.	St
1.12.10	Thunder	St
1.13.1	&quot;IDE PATA&quot; is an the best of terms for the technology.	St
1.13.2	Unfortunately for the consumer, there is more than one name for the same technology.	St
1.13.3	For today's PC user there are really only two types of hard drives--PATA and SATA.	St
1.13.4	SCSI hard drives are still around, but they rarely, if ever, appear in today's typical desktop.	St
1.13.5	Some common equivalents: PATA = Parallel ATA = ATA/33, ATA/66, ATA/100, ATA/133 = Ultra ATA SATA = Serial ATA = SATA150, SATA300, SATA I, SATA II Many retailers refer to PATA hard drives as &quot;IDE&quot; hard drives.	St
1.13.6	The common speed on today's PATA hard drives is listed as ATA/100 or ATA/133.	St
1.13.7	All major retailers should still sell IDE hard drives.	St
1.13.8	* * * * * OEM vs. RETAIL hard drives: RETAIL Hard Drive: new HD, data cable, utility software, fancy package.	St
1.13.9	OEM Hard Drive: same new HD, no data cable, no utility software, no fancy package.	St
1.13.10	The utility software may be downloaded from the hard drive maker's website.	St
1.14.1	&quot;IDE PATA&quot; is an the best of terms for the technology.	St
1.14.2	Should be: &quot;IDE PATA&quot; is NOT the best of terms for the technology.	St
