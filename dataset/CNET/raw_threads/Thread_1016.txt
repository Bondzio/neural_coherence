I hooked it up, but got a STOP 0x0000000b error (don't know if that's the exact number or not). Now i read up and I think it means I need to install my dell hard drive drivers on the hard drive to use it and boot it, but how do I go about doing that? If that's not right, and you know what is, it'd be great if your could help out. Thanks.
