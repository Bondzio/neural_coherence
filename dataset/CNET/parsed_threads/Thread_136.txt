<s> My Vaio T9550 has a 500gb SATA data drive which is almost empty plus a 45gb SSD system drive which is almost full. </s>
<s> Can I transfer any of the larger programs from the system drive to the vast emptiness of the storage drive? </s>
<s> Or do I just have to keep deleting decent programs from the SSD drive as it fills up?? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> This question is well discussed. </s>
<s> Since about 1995 with a change in Windows most programs do not move. </s>
<s> You uninstall and then re-install them to the other drive. </s>
<s> -&gt; But that's not why I wrote. </s>
<s> Some folk &quot;delete&quot; rather than uninstall and the forums find the question &quot;Why didn't that work?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> your e-mail to the SATA drive. </s>

<s> It's the programs which take up all the space on my SSD. </s>
<s> I'll try uninstalling from the SSD what can be downloaded and reinstalled on the SATA drive, but I'm not sure that'll free up too much space... </s>
<s> If I have to upgrade to a bigger SSD drive, what pitfalls should I look out for? </s>
<s> Any particular drives you'd recommend? </s>
<s> PC Magazine had an utility called &quot;COA2&quot; (Change Of Address) to do just this. </s>
<s> Though not really meant for Win XP, it does what its supposed to do. </s>
<s> I have been using it quite a bit. </s>
<s> Just make a copy of the Program Folder P2BMvd (Program to be Moved) on another drive, run COA2. </s>
<s> Rename the original folder as, say &quot;Copy of P2BMvd&quot;, just to be safe! </s>
<s> I have moved a large variety of Programs from the Program Files on C drive to other Drives and have not had an need to undo the change. </s>
<s> I delete the &quot;Copy ....&quot; after a few days. </s>

<s> While it did accomplish a drive letter change the apps failed to launch here. </s>
<s> After more than a decade it's clear that the design works as intended. </s>
<s> That is, stop copying of apps by forcing the install. </s>

<s> I came across this interesting piec of software and wondered if anyone here has used it. </s>
<s> It's not free - $15 - but a whole lot cheaper than a new hard drive. </s>

<s> Is that Microsoft Apps such as Office are what I use to test such apps. </s>
<s> Some find this to be an unfair test. </s>
