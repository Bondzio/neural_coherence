Look, we all know mac is better.
It is a lot better than any pc on the market.
First of all, a pc desktop comes with a 4-ton box and a crappy os.
Mac is faster, sleeker and more user friendly than a pc.
Hp is a good laptop, but even now, the only thing making it a good laptop is the fact that it is using mac's technology.
As soon as mac made a new design in keyboards (bigger keys, backlights and spacing) Hp did(about a month later.)
Mac is better in just about every way.
(and don't get me started on how mac doesn't crash or get viruses and windows do.)
