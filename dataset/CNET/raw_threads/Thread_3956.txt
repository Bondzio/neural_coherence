I need to find for my study project a graphics card expert who's willing to help me. The person needs to answer 15 questions (that i made) about the history of the graphics card. Thanks Chris

You'll remember words like &quot;and, nand, or and nor&quot; and maybe even &quot;Schmidt trigger&quot;...but video...what video...there wasn't anything that resembled video other than the Lissajous pattern on one's O-scope doing hard drive head alignments.

LEDs were new and expensive so incandescent bulbs and LEAD based solder. Graphics of the day was with pens that were pushed around the paper! Bob

I was once told that they were hand &quot;sewn&quot; by Asian women because they were the only people with the eyesight and steady hand to do this work. Vaguely I remember something about having read, write, and re-write functions. The beads required two lines to make them change state...X and Y. Either didn't provide enough current to switch them so this happened only at the intersection where both passed through a bead. To read from memory, an attempt was made to switch each bead back using the same method. If it switched, a small current was felt in the read line. This, effectively, cleared that bead and the controller would need to write it back again....or at least that's the explanation I remember. I'm thinking that 8 or 16 k occupied nearly 1 square foot of space on a PCB. I never saw one of these fail.

We nicknamed it the &quot;Blunderwood&quot;. but the purest would prefer one of these http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=blickensderfer&sa=N&start=0&ndsp=18

Though, some could say the punch cards were also an i/f. Let's see, input a problem and walk away or await a call to say the work was done. Also, computers were noisy back then up to a point. Those printers back then, really pounded away. Heck, I had to learn &quot;tube theory&quot; and read all those darn logic schematics. -----Willy
