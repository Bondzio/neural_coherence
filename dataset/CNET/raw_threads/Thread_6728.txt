Perhaps this is very basic, but I cannot seem to find a way to use a bluetooth head set with my desktop and outlook to dial and then speak on the telephone wirelessly. I have vista ultimate, blue tooth headset, usb modem, and office professional 2007. If not bluetooth, is there another wireless headset that you know of that you would recommend? Thanks, Allen

I have unlimited telephone service with comcast digital voice. I just want to connect using outlook to dial and pick up the call on a bluetooth (or other wireless) headset. Allen
