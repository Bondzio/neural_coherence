i have a 5 yr old dell desktop that is ready to be replaced.
i want an inexpensive replacement that will be able to handle all the basics (email, internet, quicken, etc.)
plus some basic youtube video and picture editing.
i won't be using it for gaming but i might want to be able to stream to my tv at some point.
what are some suggestions?
i'd really like to keep the total below $700 thanks!
