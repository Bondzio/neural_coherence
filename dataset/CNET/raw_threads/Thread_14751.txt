I bought a 320GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue hard drive (WD3200BEVE) for a laptop that died. Since then I have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my PC for storage. I bought a Gigaware 2.5&quot; IDE Hard Drive Enclosure. I set it up and the enclosure light turns blue. The PC searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed. From what I see on the WD website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

When I plug it in, the PC makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the Computer folder. Thanks again any help is appreciated. FYI I have a Dell that uses Windows Vista.
