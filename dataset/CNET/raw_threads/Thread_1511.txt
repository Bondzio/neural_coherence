The care and feeding of the CPU is well known so I won't write any words about heatsinks or compound as you can google that. But if the machine just needs to get more life I find disabling the L1 and L2 Cache to cure random crashes at the expense of speed. It's sad to read you have yet to refresh the heatsink compound. Bob
