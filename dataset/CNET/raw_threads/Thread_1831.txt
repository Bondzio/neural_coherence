I have a gtx 295 co-op, it is two 295 gpus in one card. http://www.evga.com/articles/00478/ Now here is my question. I beleive it is a 680 watt minimum. So if I get a 700w power supply will my computer be okay? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182173

11742	3	533594	5166529	5165241	ramarc	7/13/11 7:05 PM	1.3105839E12	that card has 2 pci-e connectors	so the sli-ready is probably fine since 12w will come off the pci-e board connection and the other two connectors only need lesss than 20w each. a single rail high voltage psu will feed power to both pci-e connectors from the single rail, but others will feed it from two rails. if you're still worried, this sli certified one will definitely fit the bill for $90 since each 12v rail is rated at 25w: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371026

Proffitt	7/14/11 7:34 AM	1.31062884E12	You're right but	After fixing too many multiple rail systems (re-jigger power connections) I am now a fan of the single rail PSU when ever possible. One less thing for the builder to get wrong. And half the work in those jobs was to give a short course in power supplies. I don't know which was harder, the machine repair or explaining why we didn't replace parts and why. Bob
