As stated above, try diskcleanup.
If this does not work and you really need to defrag might I suggest turning off sysstem restore, reboot, and then attempt to run defrag again.
Looking at your numbers, I see docs and settings at 43% but the numbers don't add up.
For all of those MS worshipers out there, it won't hurt to turn disk restore off for a bit.
It's a virus haven anyways.
