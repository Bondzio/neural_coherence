i've had a similar experience with mine.
i replaced everything to no avail, except the cpu.
i was told they hardly ever go bad, but in fact once i got a new cpu it worked fine.
however, before jumping on that bandwagon i would strongly recommend following the other posts and look into heating issues.
clean it out good (and proper) and try again.
rma's are annoying so avoid them if you can, but when all else fails replacements can make life happier if it gets the computer fixed.
