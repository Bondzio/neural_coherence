Recently, I encountered an astonishing problem. I'm completely dumbfounded and clueless. So any help is greatly appreciated. Now, the issue: Whenever I install RAM in DIMM B1&B2 the system doesn't boot up. I tried other RAMs and nothing changed. This problem occured suddenly. I mean I was working with computer and next time I turned it on, computer stopped working. Here is what I have done so far: 1) update BIOS 2) nearly every single steps in this topic : http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/ [...] -installed Thanks in advance,
