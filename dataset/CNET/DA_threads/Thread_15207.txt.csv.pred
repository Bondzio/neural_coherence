1.1.1	My venerable old Dell XPS Gen 3 gaming rig at my secondary residence finally gave up the ghost .	St
1.1.2	I was looking for a replacement .	St
1.1.3	I have had problems in the past with 2 gaming machines that I had bought for my son ... .namely a Dell and then an Alienware that were DOA right out of the box with much subsequent difficulty getting customer service to rectify the situation ( s ) .	St
1.1.4	I have a Velocity Micro at my primary residence which I paid a fortune for and this one never performed close to what was advertised and was very unstable until I upgraded it to Windows 7 .	St
1.1.5	So being a little gun shy about those 3 companies I decided to try HP .	St
1.1.6	I ordered a HPE-180e with a 3.33ghz i7 processor , 12 MB ram , a 1 TB HD , and a very high end ATI graphics card .	St
1.1.7	Well my steak continues as this thing was a hog right out of the box , could not connect to the internet wirelessly at all , and the sound card made honking noises every time I played a game .	St
1.1.8	Now I was on the phone with the idiots from HP all day yesterday who ca n't fix it .	St
1.1.9	They are all telling me I can return it for a full refund .	St
1.1.10	I 've been calling them back and no one at HP seems to know how to make this happen .	St
1.1.11	Anyway , they will refund me even if I have to get Amex involved , but in the meantime I still need a new gaming rig .	St
1.1.12	I need stable and I need reasonable/good performance for non-on-line gaming .	St
1.1.13	So I need suggestions ... please ? ?	Ques
1.1.14	?	Ques
1.2.1	Gamer machines are still tending to be finicky machines .	St
1.2.2	After decades of watching all this and helping friends and more , the goal of a stable gamer machine looks to be a lost cause .	St
1.2.3	However I 've taken simple machines and popped in better graphics cards and all is fine .	St
1.2.4	But then again I might have the advantage of be an electronics designer , writing code from before the days of the GE 210 and now writing Windows Mobile apps .	St
1.2.5	I wonder how average Joe is supposed to get a gamer machine .	St
1.2.6	Maybe a Xbox 360 or PS3 is the best solution ?	Ques
1.2.7	About the wifi .	St
1.2.8	I 've lost count how many times I 've fixed such .	St
1.2.9	All I can comment on there is the way we got wifi means that there is no standard and it is not consumer friendly .	St
1.2.10	If we could do it all over again one of the rules to market would be & quot ; it should just work. & quot ; Bob	Sug
1.3.1	alot on what you want specifically , and what your budget is .	St
1.3.2	If you 're tired of the 'out-of-the-box ' types of rigs , then there are scours of manufacturers out there that only build 'gaming PC 's ' .	St
1.3.3	When I googled 'buy a gaming pc ' this is just a few of the hits I came up with : http : //www.digitalstormonline.com/ http : //www.velocitymicro.com/category.php ? cid=12 http : //gaming-pc.avadirect.com/Custom_Tower_Gaming_PC http : //ballisticgamingpc.com/ http : //www.midlandcomputers.com/premier/index.php http : //www.pugetsystems.com/deluge.php # /nav/configure.php ? sys_id=91	Ques
1.4.1	Of the 4 PC 's I have mentioned all were custom designed and ordered from each manufacturers respective website and not store bought or out of the box .	St
1.4.2	At the time I ordered the Velocity and the Alienware machines they were primarily only doing high end gaming rigs .	St
1.4.3	As I said the Alienware was DOA and they gave us such a hard time about a return that I would never do business with them again .	St
1.4.4	The Velocity did & quot ; work & quot ; as did the & quot ; HP & quot ; I 'm sending back now , but they ran at nowhere near the promised blazing speed that I think I have the right to expect from machines that cost so much money .	St
1.4.5	The Velocity was pretty terrible until I upgraded to Windows 7 .	St
1.4.6	For the high price paid , I want quality , speed , performance and reliability .	St
1.4.7	It 's like a car .	St
1.4.8	If I buy and pay for a BMW then I have a right to expect not not to drive like a Chevy .	St
1.4.9	My primary question ... still not answered is this : What BRAND of gaming PC do the people on this thread have and/or recommend ?	Ques
1.5.1	It 's a simple machine .	St
1.5.2	I found a nice enough HP d4999t and to keep things quiet I installed a Zotac Nvidia GT 240 1GB video card which is fanless .	St
1.5.3	This runs some Intel quad core , 4GB RAM and Windows 7 Pro .	St
1.5.4	What was interesting was its speed was below par too at first .	St
1.5.5	Later I found out by chance when CDBURNERXP did n't work on it ( it emitted an error message ) that with a little google gave me the clue to install some Intel storage manager item .	St
1.5.6	Now it 's very nice .	Polite
1.5.7	I do n't expect makers to do this for us today .	St
1.5.8	We are pretty much on our own but with super tools like search engines to figure it out .	St
1.5.9	I know many think that it should n't be that way .	St
1.5.10	For those I kindly and without any offense intended ask them to go try an Apple .	St
1.5.11	Bob	St
1.6.1	it 's a matter of personal choice and what we use them for ; some will buy an off-the-shelf , then add to them ( such as what Bob has done with his HP ) .	St
1.6.2	Others ; like myself , have opted to build our own PC 's .	St
1.6.3	Another way you can try is this http : //reviews.cnet.com/1770-5_7-0.html ? query=best+gaming+pcs & tag=srch	Ques
1.7.1	Check out the hp 190t , with the six core gullftown cpu !	St
1.8.1	I just got an HP and it was dead right out of the box .	St
1.8.2	Took me 6 phone sessions with their tech support morons just to convince them it was defective .	St
1.8.3	Then 4 more calls just to get them to take the thing back .	St
1.8.4	That 's why I posted on this forum to begin with .	St
1.8.5	HP again ?	Ques
1.8.6	I DO N'T THINK SO !	St
1.8.7	!	St
