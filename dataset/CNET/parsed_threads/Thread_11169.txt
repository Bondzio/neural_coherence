<s> I have lost my designated drive letters. </s>
<s> The first clue something was wrong when I tried to burn a cd and I got an error in the burning telling me the process wasn't able to be completed. </s>
<s> I found this to be odd so I just tried it again thinking maybe it was some one time thing, (with a different cd) and got the same problem, at that time I was burning a data cd so I tried again to burn an audio cd using a different program, (the first was the windows writeable folder, the second was windows media player) but it wasn't showing a drive and by then I knew there was something wrong, so I shut down the computer and tried again. </s>
<s> Again no drive letters and I look in the Device Manager and it shows the Hp DVD Writer is disabled, try to enable and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> I checked the cords in the back of the dvd rom after shutting it down and everything was secure. </s>
<s> Please help me. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> With power-OFF, reseat the CD cable harness several times, just do it at both ends. </s>
<s> Boot-up, does the system see it and recheck the device mgr. </s>
<s> again. </s>
<s> If it still fails, visit this website: http://www.dougknox.com/ and use the fix for missing CD drives or similar. </s>
<s> Understand after all this doesn't fix the problem, you probably have a bad CD drive, it just wore out, replace. </s>
<s> It will probably be the best fix w/o all the testing, etc.. Of course use a CD cleaner to clean the drive innards as well blow out using canned air. </s>
<s> Also, it would be nice to know what drive you do have, like in model#, OS, burner s/w, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Is anyone aware of any utilities available to restore the cd-rom on a Win98 or Win98SE? </s>
<s> The PC is a sad piece of atticware (Dell Optiplex, 200mhz processor, 64MB ram, 1.9GB HDD) that my sister got for free. </s>
<s> The cd-rom has power, but won't load any disks, and doesn't show up as a drive anywhere (including BIOS?!!). </s>
<s> I have utilities I can use to squeeze a little more out of this PC and get her up and running, but I dread having to dig out all my old floppies and loading everything to them. </s>
<s> I haven't cracked open the case yet(God forbid), and told my sis maybe we should just go look for something slightly less intimidating to my newfound geek skills... </s>
<s> You didn't say if your running XP ,or what?But your best bet is to go to device manager and uninstall the driver and let windows reinstall it.Hope it works. </s>
<s> I had the same problem.There were no cd rom or writer icons in &quot;My Computer&quot;.In the device manager the icons were there but with yellow marks.The properties showed that&quot;windows finished loading the drivers but could not find the hardware&quot;.Error code 41.I tried everything possible but in vain.Re formated and installed XP.Now everything is fine.Still don't know what caused the icns disappear! </s>
