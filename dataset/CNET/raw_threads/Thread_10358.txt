When i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past. Two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers. Also there is a file called &quot;WuTempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files. Is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything.

Also, if your OS is XP, you can probably turn off system restore for drives you just use for storage because it won't save those for you.
