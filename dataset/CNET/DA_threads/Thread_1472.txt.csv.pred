1.1.1	ECS L4VXA2 P-4 socket 478 / 533fsb / 512K 512MB PC2700 DDR Thanks so very much for reading .	St
1.1.2	I have read up on the ECS L4VXA2 and I know it causes a lot of grief .	St
1.1.3	I 'm going to list below my & quot ; known & quot ; items .	St
1.1.4	I do really appreciate the input .	St
1.1.5	Symptom : With everything hooked up , trying to turn the machine 'ON ' results in zilch , nada , no fans , no action , nothing .	St
1.1.6	( 1 ) I do have both the 20-pin ATX1 and 4-pin ATX2 connectors plugged in .	St
1.1.7	( 2 ) To eliminate the PSU as a problem , I have tested the PSU on a power supply tester and it passed for all six voltage rails .	St
1.1.8	( 3 ) The memory is a PC2700 512MB stick which I used previously , and in fact before putting into this ECS , I ran it on several passes on MemTest86 to ensure there were no errors .	St
1.1.9	( 4 ) Just a side comment , I *believe* that even if the memory module were not friendly , the motherboard would still be able to power up and would beep on that part of the POST involving memory module detection .	St
1.1.10	( 5 ) The front power LED , when plugged into the panel connector , lights up -- showing juice is running through the length of the motherboard .	St
1.1.11	( 6 ) I changed out power controller switch just in case the switch on the case was bad .	St
1.1.12	Still nada .	St
1.1.13	( 7 ) I reset the CMOS and even changed the +3V battery .	St
1.1.14	If you can think of anything else , which would or might result in total silence/nothing even though I know the motherboard has a throughput of voltage , I 'd be grateful to learn more from your experience .	St
1.1.15	Thanks again !	St
