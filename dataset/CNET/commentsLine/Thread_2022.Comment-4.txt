thank you both for your replies.
funny enough i never noticed that my webcam led is on even with the computer off.
over the last 10 years i have upgraded, build, semi-destroyed quite a few computers.
most problems were selfinflicted jumpers, leads or similar.
my most recent kockup was to forget the atx power cable and spent days to find the cause of a &quot;dead&quot; mb.
therefore i think there is something more or less obvious or simple-again.
those things are often difficult to spot because its so unbelievable obvious.
the article with the caps is interesting but is seems i never had a problem with that.
this problem happened with the same setup but two different mb's and psu's.
i have currently a asus a8n-sli premium (heatpipe no cooling fan), athlon 64 3400 with a large copper zalman cooler, 2 gb ram, nvidia graphics card (passively cooled) and wintek tv card.
the psu is a 580w hiper-very solid build.
the computer and many peripherals are attached to extension lead with surge protection.
it is that what is switched off to save electicity from all those stand-by power consumers.
