1.1.1	im thinking on buying a dell demension xps gen 5 and was wondering if the computer would still run like its addvertised to without ne upgrades	St
1.2.1	go for monarch, abs, cyberpower, velocity micro,etc or build ur own.	St
1.2.2	the reason is dell doesnt come with amd dual core.	St
1.2.3	i would suggest building ur own cuz the dell xps gen 5 depending on the configuration would cost $2000 anyway.	Sug
1.3.1	Build your own.... Cheaper and probably runs better too.	St
1.3.2	Since dell is proprietary, don't count on ANY upgrades in the future besides more ram and another harddrive, and gfx card swap.	St
1.3.3	Roger	St
1.4.1	in english please	St
1.5.1	my uncle works on computers for a living and he says that the bast way to go is the xps but i havent been able to ask him about upgrades yet so thats why im on this forum and i appreciate the help also im 14 so im not exactly sure i know how to make my own pc	St
1.6.1	I've just turned 15....	St
1.6.2	It's not in proper english, but is readible.	St
1.6.3	I hate english, especially when you know more than the teachers, so let's get on with it.	St
1.6.4	Well, no offense to your uncle, but if all you know are oems (acronym for original equipment manufacturers), then dell is the only choice if you want dual-core extremem edition.	St
1.6.5	So i guess it's alright.	St
1.7.1	jesus, i wish i had over 2 grand to blow on a computer when i was 14. uh, maybe, if you want just take the xps.	St
1.7.2	otherwise, i would build my own.	St
1.7.3	google it, and you will find your answers konny	St
1.8.1	Not trying to be offensive to our good young men posters here in these CNet forums, but take a little trip to the Cnet GameSpot forums or any Gamers forum, and you will find many, many kids with apparently wealthy families sporting expensive computers who look down and degrade anyone who doesn't have the &quot;best/most expensive&quot;.

1.10.1	the people in other forums i read that post.	St
1.10.2	&quot;yeah, im 15, have an athlon fx 57 with 2 gigs of corsair ram, dual raptors in raid 0 and an sli setup with 2 nvidia 6800 ultras.	St
1.10.3	should i go out to buy the 7800gtxs?	Sug
1.10.4	that would be two i mean.&quot; it just bugs me that someone would spend over $1200 on 2 graphics cards when they have a perfect setup with the two ultras.	St
1.10.5	and then theres us regular gamers/casual users that have our x600, 6600,6600gt, 9600xt,9800 pro.	St
1.10.6	i swear, it boggles me!	St
