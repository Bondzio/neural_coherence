If you have Nero 6 Ultra in there, I can safely give you the site to get it.
It is the NeroVision Express 3, package 2.
I had to remove NERO MediaHome,NERO Photosnap (take your photos out of the computer, it did mess with mine), NERO Photosnap Viewer & NERO Showtime (I have PowerDVD).
All on theis link is the updated version of 4.4.1.4 and everything is updates at: http://www.nero.com/us/nero-up.php/ PS - I was incorrect about needing both.
In a magazine I get, it has DVDShrink, NERO Recode, AnyDVD, Intervideo DVD Copy 4, DVD Dycrypter and #1 DVD Ripper (add DVD Santa to that!!)
This magazine has instructions on how to build a laptop with what you want in it.
Broke hip in Dec 2005 and wound up getting it, sent card from rehab.
