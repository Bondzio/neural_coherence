if i don't necessarily want to create a network, but rather just want an internet connection can i just place a wireless router (i have wireless capability) in between my brothers cable modem and computer?
my concern is if incorporating a router would mess with his internet connection?
i assume i could do all this and then just set up the router on my computer.
any input would be appreciated.
thanks.
