<s> Alright... let me run down everything that has happened so far: This started out when I was building an entire new system, including these components: ASRock 939Dual-SATA2 (motherboard) Raidmax 450W power supply XFX GeForce 6800GT AGP 8X (video card) AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (processor) 1024 GB Corsaid DDR400 RAM Okay, so I installed everything correctly, but I left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card. </s>
<s> I turned the computer on, and when giving it power I got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor. </s>
<s> I (stupidly) let the thing make this sound for about 10 seconds and then it shut down, and I smelled a faint burning smell (I am pretty sure this came from my power supply when I got down and checked). </s>
<s> I couldn't get the computer to come back on after that. </s>
<s> I used the 420W power supply which came with my case next, and found the same thing happening (at the time I didn't know this was because I didn't have power going to video card from the power source), but I quickly turned the computer off. </s>
<s> Now I am stuck. </s>
<s> When hooking the power up to the video card (which I recently realized I needed to do, although all too late) everything appears to run fine but I can't get a display to appear on my monitor. </s>
<s> I need to know which parts are beyond repair so I can rebuild this system... </s>
<s> I checked the motherboard for any spots of burns or anything and found none, but it could still be messed up. </s>
<s> I haven't took the fan off the processor to check it yet, but I will do that after this post. </s>
<s> I just need to know if there is any way I can test to see which part was affected by this incident: my video card, processor, or motherboard. </s>
<s> Are all three bad and do I need to replace them all, or is there any way I can test each part individually? </s>
<s> Response would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> NOTE: a bunch of this happened in another post, for more info you can read it at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=139073&messageID=1563091 </s>
<s> I am not trying to be rude, but i tried helping you before and you never said about doing this to the video card. </s>
<s> You swore up and down that everything was 100%, even though i had a feeling it wasn't. </s>
<s> I specifically told you to check your vid card and all wires. </s>
<s> Once again you said, 100%. </s>
<s> You screwed up, you plugged something in when the pc was on and probably fried your card or worse. </s>
<s> This was your reply to me on one issue confused about the powersupply which i read incorrectly but still... &lt;&lt;&lt;No, I didn't confirm hooking up anythign wrong, in fact everything was hooked up correctly and I am 100% sure on this. </s>
<s> The only thing which I was questionable about was the &quot;POWER SW&quot; coming from the case to the motherboard but I can now confirm it was in the right spot... the power button on the front will turn the machine on and off. </s>
<s> So now, I have everything (and did have everything) hooked up correctly, yet I got the screeching sound and the power supply burnt up. </s>
<s> So does this in fact mean the motherboard was bad? </s>
<s> If nothing was hooked up incorrectly, it had to be one of the two... motherboard or video card.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once again, I just want to point this out. </s>
<s> Good luck, you will need it. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Well, at the time, I was 100% sure. </s>
<s> I don't know how I missed the power on the video card. </s>
<s> But about what you said about plugging it in while the PC was on, no, I didn't plug anything in when the PC was on? </s>
<s> I knew not to do that. </s>
<s> Do you know any way I can test these components? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Okay, so I installed everything correctly, but I left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card. </s>
<s> (( I turned the computer on, and when &lt;&lt;giving it power&gt;&gt; I got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor.) </s>
<s> This is where I figured you meant the vid card. </s>
<s> Do you have an old pc to try it in? </s>
<s> I remember from last posts, you have nowhere to have it checked by liscensed tech so, all you can do is my above mentioned, a different pc perhaps. </s>
<s> Does the motherboard have onboard monitor port? </s>
<s> I still feel you have bigger issues with the motherboard and in my opinion, it's not in good health. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> I have nothing else to test it out on... an old PC but it has no AGP slot and isn't socket 939 so I can't test out the processor or video card. </s>
<s> Okay having the motherboard be the only problem is what I am hoping... it was only $70 and is much better than having to replace a $300 video card. </s>
<s> I checked the processor, and everything looks fine phsyically but I know that isn't the case. </s>
<s> Does it matter that anything else on the motherboard works? </s>
<s> Like the led's and power switches, the USB ports, the CPU fan, and stuff like that? </s>
<s> If the motherboard were fried, does it mean that nothing would work at all or just the parts that are fried (I am assuming the AGP slot). </s>
<s> If just the AGP slot is ruined and nothing else (which I have no way of telling), could it be possible for me to buy a PCIExpress video card and just use it in my current setup? </s>
<s> I read somewhere about testing a video card outside a motherboard to see if it worked and can't remember how it was done, something about using the s-video cable and plugging it from the TV-out on my card to the S-video in on my TV... do you know anything about this or how I can test the card to see if it is still working without an AGP slot? </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I am about to order the replacement stuff, and I know I'm going to have to have a new motherboard, processor, or video card, or two of three or all three. </s>
<s> I'm going to order the motherboard first, hoping that my video card and processor are still good and that I just fried some part of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Without a monitor to see anything on, you really can't use the tv out etc...You don't have an OS installed do you? </s>
<s> I asked before but not sure you saw, do you have a mainboard monitor port? </s>
<s> A monitor port attached to the motherboard? </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> No onboard display, just printer port and serial and the usual stuff </s>
<s> As before, it is going against my grain to even move on with this. </s>
<s> In my opinion, something is beyond wrong here. </s>
<s> The last thing I will attempt to ask you is, do you have an older pci or agp card to test in the machine? </s>
<s> I read some specs on your MB and it will run an older AGP just fine, according to the specs that is. </s>
<s> That would be my very last suggestion to you since I think your motherboard is in trouble and as I suggested before, I wouldn't even try to start it. </s>
<s> After this,I will bow out and leave it to someone else, but I can say, IF another vid card won't work, it's trashed. </s>
<s> Either way, good luck. </s>
