i bought the hp pavilion s3220n.
i upgraded the graphics card to nvidia 8400 gs.
i can play call of duty 4 with no probs even with the resolution set at higest.
i also got the hp pocket drive.
this machine was worth the bang for the buck.
i am not a serious gamer but more or less both gamer and work user on the comp.
i like it!
