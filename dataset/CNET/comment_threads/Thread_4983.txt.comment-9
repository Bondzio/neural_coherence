Hello Luap_42 I have this exact problem, except that my Iomega is specifically a Mac EHB.
I do have VMWare, but since it it Mac formatted, this detailed process won't apply to me.
Do you have ANY suggestions on how to achieve the same end solution of emptying the detached Trash files from the EHD using Terminal Mac commands?
My Time capsule is enroute, as I recently moved back to the US-hence why I was using this EHB as a temporary back-up.
Directly deleting the back-up file from the drive is what caused this issue.......
I've done a lot of research on Mac forums and nothing has worked.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
