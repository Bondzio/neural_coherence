1.1.1	Alright, so I got my computer custom made, and the day after i order it, I read something about how power supplies are the #1 Most overlooked part of a custom comp.	St
1.1.2	I got the intel i7 and a 400w power supply, should that be enough, because now that I have the computer, it worked fine for the first week, and now in the past 12 hours of use, it has turned off instantly 3 times now, the first two times i was running many things and thought it might have been a little too much for the power supply, but the most recent time, it turned off right when i started it up after going to google...	St
1.1.3	Thanks in advance for the help...	St
1.2.1	Checked the system temps ?	Ques
1.2.2	What else is in the system...specifically what parts by mfg and part number are in the system ?	Ques
1.2.3	And as always... all power supplies are not equal.	St

1.4.1	then i'd say the 400w power supply is probably too small.	St
1.5.1	and frankly your dealer should have told you that when you ordered your system.	St
1.5.2	Have you contacted them ?	Ques
1.5.3	http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?psn=000101&pid=202 400 Watt or greater power supply (550 Watt for ATI CrossFireX technology in dual mode) is recommended.	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Well, i guess i have the minimum, because i actually havent installed the crossfire myself, because due to some confusion in the order, they had sent the bridge but didnt install it in the computer, so i will have to uprade the power supply before installing it...thanks for your help guys!	St
1.7.1	installed and connected to the PSU ?	Ques
1.7.2	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	Oh, I didn't know that if it wasn't being used that it would still run, then I guess yeah, the other card is installed just not connected with the crossfire link that I cannot figure out how to intall for the life of me...	St
1.9.1	cards are still running and pulling power from the bus....that's why you're having a problem now.	St
1.9.2	Just make sure you get a good quality PSU...because like everything all 600 watt PSUs are not equal.	St
1.9.3	The better ones use less electricity too.	St
1.9.4	VAPCMD	St
