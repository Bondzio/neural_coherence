1.1.1	I currently have added a Maxtor PCI SATA card to my system , but the motherboard ( P4 1.7 with 66mh mobo , I think ) does n't let me enjoy the truly high-end speeds because of the PCI bottleneck .	St
1.1.2	Sadly , the attached HD has taken to coughing fits of random mechanical noises and must soon be replaced .	St
1.1.3	To the same system , I 've added an Adaptec USB 2.0 expansion card .	St
1.1.4	Q : Any comments/ideas as to the differences in speed to be expected on an internal SATA replacement drive -vs- external USB 2.0 drive in this case ?	Ques
1.1.5	thanks in advance for any help .	Polite
1.2.1	PCI at 66MHz is for a 32bit PCI bus or roughly 264 million bytes per second .	St
1.2.2	There are web sites that cover this in gory detail so the average ATA133 drive is all of 133 megabytes per second in a burst .	St
1.2.3	The slow PCI bus you write can burst at over 2X an ATA drive and SATA drives are not much faster .	St
1.2.4	Think this one over since USB 2.0 is just some 480 mega BITS per second and that pales in comparison to both SATA and PCI speeds .	St

1.3.1	Ah thanks for the stats in detail .	Polite
1.3.2	So clearly the internal drive will be much faster , but my sound card is also on the PCI bus ( which my understanding is the number you state is shared amongst everything ) .	St
1.3.3	Also , I 'm not sure - does the AGP video card draw from that as well ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks for the prompt reply .	St
1.3.5	This follow-up is to primarily fuel or extenguish my lust for an onboard SATA adapter .	St
1.4.1	Sadly , I do n't offer a course in PC architecture in this small space of a few paragraphs .	St
1.4.2	While it is possible to give one off answers to specific points , the PC architecture is widely discussed out on the web or in a book for the better book stores .	St
1.4.3	I 'm unsure what you are attempting but there are bottlenecks all over various PCs .	St
1.4.4	But in spite of that we still use them .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hey stevel2000 .	St
1.5.2	The PCI bus is separate from the AGP bus .	St
1.5.3	AGP has it 's own bus dedicated soley to the video card plugged into it ( and it 's much faster than the PCI bus , despite the usual 3 or 4 PCI slots which all share the same PCI bus ) .	St
1.5.4	So yes , your sound card and SATA card would be sharing the same bus .	Res
1.5.5	It 's unfortunate that the moderator chose to , in this case , be a pretentious , unhelpful jerk .	St
1.5.6	Do n't offer a coure in PC architecture ?	Ques
1.5.7	Let 's stop being condescending for a second and just say that you do n't know .	St
