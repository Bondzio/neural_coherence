can anyone recommend a scanner to scan farbic collage?
they're not very thick - a few layers of fabric.
i print a photo on my inkjet printer which is then sewn onto fabric -usually silk.
the fabric can be shiny and doesn't photograph well.
i thought a scanner would do a better job.
the end result will go on my website.
most forums concentrate on photo scanning.
my intent is rather unusal.
i think a resolution of 3200x6400 dpi will do.
thanks for your help!
