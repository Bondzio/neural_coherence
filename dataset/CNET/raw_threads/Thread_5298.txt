Is the integrated microphone sufficient or should I consider buying headsets too? I'll be in Spain for 5 months next winter and my girlfriend will still be in Canada. I plan on talking to her regularly through the webcam. DO you think it would be worth it to invest maybe 40$ in headsets too? thanks a lot Mathieu

I'd just get a ten dollar external mic, and use the laptop speakers for listening. Then again, a proper computer nerd (self) works better with a headset on so the cord will get tangled in my pens in my pocket protector. A headset takes up more room also when not in use.
