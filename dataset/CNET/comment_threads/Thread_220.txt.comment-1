Iam trying to add a Ultra ATA Barracuda Seagate 7200 40Gig to a Dell dimension 4700 desktop with SATA HDD installed and working perfectly already.
I have added the HDD to the cable which is used to connect to the CD ROM.
I enabled the HDD in Bios.
But still not able to detect in WinXP.
There are three setup available in the jumper.
1.
Master/Slave 2.
Cable Select 3.
Limits drive capacity I tried all three but still no success.
Any pointer would be of helpful.
