<s> Please help. </s>
<s> after struggling with an range expander that didnt work. </s>
<s> i unplug it and reset the thing to toss. </s>
<s> The trouble is now i have 2 ssid with same name but one is secured and the other is not. </s>
<s> i tried to upgrade the old router with a new one, and the unsecured ssid still lingers on, besides having weaker signals. </s>
<s> now i cant connect to the new router. </s>
<s> when i tried go back to the old router and created a new ssid with different channel... why is the old ssid (non-secured one) still shows up on my list of network?? </s>
<s> and the new ssid keep disappearing and i couldn't log on to it? </s>
<s> old router wrt54gs (using it ) new router wrt300n (ready to return to store) range expander wre54g please help </s>
<s> Press the reset button in the back of the wireless router for 30 seconds, then power it on. </s>
<s> setup should be wall &gt; ISP modem/router &gt; wireless router &gt; wired/wireless Update the firmware in the wireless router. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID(change this to make connecting easier) Use WPA security. </s>
<s> Use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Most devices work better on these channels mixed b and g mode(n is it applies) Save changes and exit. </s>
<s> Power down everything. </s>
<s> Turn on the isp modem/router wait 30 seconds turn on the wireless router. </s>
<s> Wait 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Now turn on your computer. </s>
<s> Try to connect to the new SSID. </s>
<s> You could also try the range expander and it should also work. </s>
<s> I think it's the combination or the WPA security and the channels. </s>
<s> Let me know what you got. </s>

<s> Just wait. </s>
<s> I know there is a fix to toss out that display but in 24 hours to a few weeks Windows will stop offering that old SSID. </s>
