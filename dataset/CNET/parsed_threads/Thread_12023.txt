<s> I have a Creative SB Audigy 2 ZB (WDM) into which I have a Microphone plugged in. </s>
<s> I am running XP PRO in a Dell Dimension 8400. </s>
<s> Setting the Mic recording output to 100%, I'm having very little output, I tried a different Mic with the same results. </s>
<s> is there any other setting in the board to increase the output, when I want to use the Mic with Skype and any other programs I need the Mic almost inside my mouth to get some signal output. </s>
<s> Any help? </s>
<s> Right click the speaker icon in the taskbar(is it there first?) </s>
<s> and choose advanced properties for the microphone in the recording tab. </s>
<s> You should see a box you can check to add a 20db gain to the microphone input. </s>
<s> I toggled the Mic boost On, but I did not get a increase in signal output. </s>
<s> To be able to get a normal signal output, I have to put the Mic almost against my lips. </s>
<s> Raul. </s>
<s> Check to see if the microphone jack is inserted all the way into the proper input on the soundcard. </s>
<s> In the recording controls, you're not loooking for microphone output, rather the input level or recording level. </s>
<s> Wave volume should be near max as well as the recording level. </s>
<s> Do you have a &quot;what you hear&quot; slider? </s>
<s> Increase it if you do. </s>
<s> Are you using a mono microphone and selecting a stereo recording? </s>
