Would it be better to buy a cheap tablet (under $100) with hdmi cable and use it just for tv or buy a roku player (I want to view shows on netflix, hulu, or youtube)? Would a cheap tablet be worth buying (you can use it for traveling as well or other things if needed)?

We call them &quot;training tablets&quot; or the tablet a person gets when they want to try out a tablet but don't want to buy the real thing. Bob
