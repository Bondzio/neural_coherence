I would like to perform a &quot;spring clearing&quot; for my 2 years old DELL Dimension E520 via DELL PC Restore.
I have added a new hardware i.e PCI NVIDIA VGA Card and wonder whether I should uninstall the card before I perform the PC Restore task.
Can anyone advise me here?
Appreciate your help and feedback.
