We have a laptop that has wireless to the internet, our pc and printer through a router.
Internet access is thru the pc.
We have a modem from our cable provider that hooks up the pc to the router and the internet.
Suddenly the laptop can't access the printer, and the pc can't access the laptop, although the laptop can access the pc and the internet!!??
So parts of the wireless network are operative, and parts aren't, and I don't know where to start in sorting it all out.
The problem started after the cable co. installed a new modem, but this may have just been coincidence, and since internet access works just fine, it doesn't seem as tho' that should be the source of the problem.
Any suggestions?
