on what YOU are using this system for.
If YOU are happy with what you have, then why shell out a few more of your hard earned cash for an extra 2 cores?
What's going to happen when AMD launches their 6-core CPU's, are you going to upgrade to that next?
You can get into a nasty (and needless to say, expensive) habit of ever upgrading your system; upgrade when the NEED arises, not when pressured by family or friends.
My vote is no.
