It has to be lightweight and if it's a tablet, needs to run an office program that's compatible with a PC office suite. Her school has PC's and she'll need to turn in written assignments in the doc format. A netbook would work, but every netbook I've seen hasn't looked sturdy enough hold up to being carried around all day by a 12 year old. Any suggestions or starting points are welcome!

This means that for now you'll be looking at Windows 7 Pads. Here's a few. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100013681+600004968&QksAutoSuggestion=&ShowDeactivatedMark=False&Configurator=&IsNodeId=1&Subcategory=2557&description=&hisInDesc=&Ntk=&CFG=&SpeTabStoreType=&AdvancedSearch=1&srchInDesc= It looks like your choices are going down to about a handful of units fast.
