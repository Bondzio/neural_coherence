<s> My video card is ATI Rage Pro, The computer is a Pentium 3 600mhz running on windows XP. </s>
<s> I just need to increase the cards memory from 8Mb(approximatly) to 16 Mb to run Rise of Nations. </s>
<s> Do ATI cards support these adjustments? </s>
<s> A 64MB card is less than the game in question at http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=MX400SDR-64MB or about 35 dollars. </s>
<s> You'll have to decide if its worth it. </s>
