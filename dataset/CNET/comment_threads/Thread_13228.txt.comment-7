I had that wicked problem a few months back.
First off, the ethernet card, NIC, in the PC: Is it internal or is it on a PCI card.
Maybe try switching.
I had to get a cheap NIC for PCI 'cause my internal one died on me.
Also: Do you have floresceunet (The spelling fairy is going to kill me) light bulbs?
I had the weirdest thing happen.
With the lights on: The modem WOULD work, with the lights OFF it would not.
A pain, and a high electric bill.
I ended up moving the PC.
