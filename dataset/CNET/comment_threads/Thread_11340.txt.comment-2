Before you go out & buy a new MoBo, try the power button/reset switch angle.
On many systems the mechanical elements are usually the most vulnerable, especially if not used for a while.
Power down, remove the power cord and remove the shorting pins connecting the reset switch to the MoBo.
Power up your system and see if your system boots.
If it does then you will need a new reset microswitch, unless you can live without one.
Alternatively, a very small squirt of WD-40 to the microswitch may help (unless it's broken, of course).
A new case is another alternative.
Good Luck
