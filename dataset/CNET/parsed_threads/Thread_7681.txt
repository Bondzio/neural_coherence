<s> Hi, I have to reinstall my Windows XP, before y download all to a external drive (from a friend). </s>
<s> But by mistake I reloaded with now mostly useless files my hard drive. </s>
<s> Is there a way to recognize which files are been used and which to get rid? </s>
<s> if possible, if there is a way to delete them not one by one will be grate. </s>
<s> thank for your attention to my question and your knowledge and suggestions. </s>

<s> Maybe a fresh install one more time? </s>
<s> thans for your reply, I had thougt of that, but to go again through all that process will be so time consuming (making againg a backup and reinstaling and configurating them will is something that I am not looking forward) But thank for your quick and kindly answer. </s>
<s> regards from Mexico Luis Lesur </s>
