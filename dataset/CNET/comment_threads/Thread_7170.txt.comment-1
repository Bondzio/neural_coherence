I wasn't sure where to post this, but I'm a CIS student about to take a Microsoft Windows Server class online, and I'm looking to buy a used server just to fool around with.
I'm currently looking at a used - Dell PowerEdge SC1425 blade server for about $200.
But I've always worked with desktops, I know little about servers.
If someone has any other suggestions on what to look for to deploy an OS over a small network, please let me know.
Should I look at a server like this or just build a desktop type server?
