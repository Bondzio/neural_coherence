In test by Tomshardware the 2.4GHZ Athlon 64 3300 and the 3.0Ghz Intel P4 are pretty closely matched, but both outperform/faster than the 2.2GHz Athlon XP3200.
In their test of the 2.4 GHz Athlon 64 3300 it is generally a little faster in games than the 3.0GHZ Intel P4, but the Intel 3.0 P4 did go faster in the Wolfenstein, Quake3 Arena, and Aqua Mark3 games.
However, IMO you would not personally be able to tell the difference in their speed based on the processor alone, without instruments.
