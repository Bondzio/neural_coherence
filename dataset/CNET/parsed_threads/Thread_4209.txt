<s> Hello Maybe I am asking for the impossible. </s>
<s> But I would like to know any third party manufacturer that makes wireless network cards and corresponding drivers/software/hardwork hookup(if needed) for a mac g4 desktop system. </s>
<s> Optimally it would communicate with a linksys wrt54gs wireless router through a cable modem on a small internet network with two other &quot;OS&quot; systems, (win XP and win98). </s>
<s> Mac manufacturer's seem to have an &quot;airport&quot; card or similar device and make it very unclear if there is any other hardware that can be used. </s>
<s> this makes it very hard to know what I can use that will work in my situation. </s>
<s> If anybody can help me out on this issue I would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I get the Apple product. </s>
<s> It will work fine with other wifi networks. </s>
<s> Why jump ship? </s>

<s> wireless network adaptor (i.e. </s>
<s> wusb54g), didn't have the drivers for apple.. once your apple have the apple card.. you can connect to other devices (wrt54gs, etc.) </s>
<s> I don't really know the reasons, why all those manufacturers didn't have the drivers for apple computers. </s>
<s> The money. </s>
<s> Drivers are expensive to make. </s>
<s> With Apple still in the single digit market share that would plague the product with a 10X higher cost per unit for just the driver. </s>
<s> Add more dollars for your tech support lines and many manufacturers will just pass. </s>
<s> It's simple to understand once you're told. </s>
