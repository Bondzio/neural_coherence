Should I buy a set top box with streaming capabilities? Or a video card with HDMI out and buy a really long HDMI cable? I like the ability to control what i watch from the couch. The set top box would let me do that. If i go the video card route, is there a way to control my pc from the couch?

So, all you need to do is connect your PC and PS3 to your home network using Ethernet cable or wireless (Ethernet cable is best, but it you go wireless, choose wireless N if you want to stream HD video). Once all connected to your home network and you have installed a DLNA server on your PC, you will see the DLNA server's icon appear on your PS3. On your PS3, you will be able to browse your folders/files and play them as you want. For DLNA-servers, I'd suggest Mezzmo as it is my favorite after playing with all the others but there are free ones as well.

I currently use Tversity, free version. So, if I get a DLNA server, then if I try to stream something that is protected by Cinavia, it will still stream? And an unrelated question. Do you know how to turn off the windows media center streaming because I don't like two icons appearing on my PS3. I know it's petty and picky but I'm picky.

I'd try it and see how you go. If no success, I'd ask the developers of your DLNA server for their help.
