1.3.1	Antec ( as bob said ) PC Power and Cooling ( considered best of the best ) OCZ Enermax ( most units ) Fortron Source Power ( FSP Group , and their hgher up stuff is fine ) Sparkle Power ( same stuff as Fortron ( their like the same company ) ) and some of Thermaltake 's units are fine , depending on what your using it for also 600W is rather huge i 'd suggest 480W - 580W ensure the PSU has at least 24A on the +12v rail OR 2 12v rails at around 15A+ each ( for example , Antec 's newpower is 12v1 20A , 12v2 18A , which is fine ) OR 3-4 12v rails , with 15A each or more	St
