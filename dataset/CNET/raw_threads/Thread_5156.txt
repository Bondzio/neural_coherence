Can anyone tell me if these are for use with plug-in (external) mic or is there an internal microphone that I need to activate, find, configure or do something to to make it work.

If the desktop had an internal microphone (installed, say, in the front of the case), the desktop case would have to sit on your desktop and you would have to speak into your case. Not uncommon with notebooks, but on a desktop???
