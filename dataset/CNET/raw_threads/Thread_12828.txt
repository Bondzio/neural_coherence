I'm connecting these to my Windows XP SP2 computer. I am able to access the web from my local PC, and am also able to access the web from my Pocket PC via wireless connection using the Netgear router. The problem I'm having is that I am unable to access my personal computer via VPN over the web. I get to the point where it finds my computer and tries to validate the username/password, but no matter what I do I get the error ''The username and/or password is not valid on the domain''. I have never set up a domain, and checked, double-checked, triple-checked, and even reset my username and password on my PC, but can't get around this. Here's some info about my setup: WESTELL ROUTER SETUP IP = 192.168.1.1 The Westell is set up basically with the factory defaults. The only changes I made to connect to Verizon Online was I changed VCI 35 to ''PPPoE'' (was ''Bridge''). I also added PPTP as a service, pointing to my local PC (192.168.0.2). Once I had the Westell Router set up and running, I installed the Netgear Wireless Router. NETGEAR WIRELESS ROUTER IP = 192.168.0.1 I used the provided setup CD to add the Netgear router to the mix. The only changes I made to the setup are (1) I added wireless Security Encryption (WEP); (2) I added Port Forwarding for PPTP to my local PC (192.168.0.2); (3) I disabled the SPI Firewall. LOCAL PC SETUP (WINDOWS XP) I added an Incoming connection for VPN's. My computer is assigned to a workgroup, not a Domain. I am also using the No-IP web service to be able to VPN into my PC over the internet without having to worry about the dynamic IP of my PC. I was able to establish a successful VPN connection over the web prior to introducing the Netgear router. Any other info you might need, please let me know. I am completely stuck, and would really like to get this figured out. Thanks! Brian

Therefore why not install a Wi-Fi card in the desktop, bridge the Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections to do away with the second router. Then enable Internet Connection Sharing on the desktop and create a VPN.

I suppose as a last resort I may do that, but if there's any way to get it working with my current setup, I'd like to. I feel like I'm so darn close, like I'm missing just one little step. Brian

The wireless will still work, as long as it is enabled. It will just get it's IP from the Westell. As long as you have port fowarding, and PPTP configured correctly, this should work.
