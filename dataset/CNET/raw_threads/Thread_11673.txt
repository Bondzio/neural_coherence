I want to connect the two routers so that we can share the data on the server wirelessly. Tried VPNing it but the proprietary software we use is too bulky and takes to long to load the data via wireless VPN, so any ideas on how to connect the two networks wirelessly. Thanks in advance!

I purchased 2 wireless access pts that I was going to connect but Netgear did not support the repeater function...any ideas, thanks in advance! Robert

Too bad I don't know what you have to work with here but a common network bond would have you use one and only one router then place a client wifi device in a bridge mode to your wired lan. Then place a WAP somewhere inside your facility. The client would be on the channel that the (master) router is and your WAP should be on the opposite channel. For example, the master router would be on channel 1 and your WAP would be on channel 11 to keep interference down. Example. Client device in bridge mode -&gt; Wired LAN -&gt; WAP Sorry I don't teach networking in this small space. I also will not duplicate ready web content. Not being mean but you have to understand this well enough to be self supporting. I can't be your support. Bob
