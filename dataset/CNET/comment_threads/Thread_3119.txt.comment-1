Hello - I'm thinking of buying the Samsung 244T widescreen LCD for my PC.
I'm also buying a new PC and want to make sure everything's compatible.
What will I need as far as a video card?
I know that some PC games are compatible with 16:9 ratio, but what about the ones that aren't?
Will they be stretched out or just normal size (4:3) on the screen - with black bars on the left and right of the screen?
Any help is much appreciated?
Thanks Tim
