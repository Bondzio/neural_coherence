<s> I have acquired a computer with a Biostar motherboard M7nba. </s>
<s> I need to replace the HD but can't locate a resources disk. </s>
<s> I have googled with no success. </s>
<s> Biostar does not show this board on their site. </s>
<s> Anyone out there that could point me in the right direction </s>
<s> Many of the proprietaties such as HP, Dell etc get their mobos from mainline vendors, however the vendor cannot provide info related to the mobo because by contract it is now proprietary to the computer maker. </s>
<s> Check the mobo mfr's site for a mobo very similar, same basic chipsets and other chips. </s>
<s> The drivers will very likely be the same so use that one's drivers. </s>
<s> without needing the resource disc. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> This system was made by a individual who is no longer available for contact. </s>
<s> What I have can be seen at http://www.bjorn3d.com/read_pf.php?cID=350 I just don't know how to find the video and sound drivers for this board </s>
<s> Have never found video and sound drivers with a new HD </s>
<s> Not enough information to say this is correct. </s>
<s> Model name; M7NBA. </s>
<s> System name: iDEQ 210N. </s>
<s> http://www.biostar.com.tw/support/cpu/barebone.php3 Listed under Barebones, select eDEQ 2100 http://www.biostar.com.tw/support/driver/index.php3 Displays model. </s>
<s> http://www.biostar.com.tw/products/lcdpc/edeq2.php3 Shop may have pulled MB from orginal case, you may want to download the manual and compare it to your MB. </s>

<s> There was no mention of needing video or audio drivers in original post..so it was not covered. </s>
<s> If you need new drivers for such, go to manufacturer for them. </s>
<s> Which is what should be done regardless of who originally supplied them. </s>
<s> and life goes on.... Jack </s>
<s> My suggestion is contact Biostar Support. </s>
<s> If they answer, maybe they can point you to the right drivers. </s>
<s> Could be they are old enough to be dropped from the listing, but still available. </s>
<s> *This comes up if you choose the mini-pc listed as using the M7NBA motherboard. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> I found the video driver from that site and it works. </s>
<s> I think I can find the audio driver there also. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> We've all had to spend time raking through vague manufacturer's sites. </s>
