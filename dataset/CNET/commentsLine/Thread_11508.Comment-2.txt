mine is setup exactly like this forum's sticky tells us.
latest firmware, default settings, then wpa.
it has run for months without a reboot except for those pesky power outages.
downstairs (the router is on the top story as basements are a bad idea) a simple lenovo y530 with hdmi can play hulu via hdmi to the hdtv.
and this with the wifi set to 802.11g mode only.
so is that your hd answer?
what else?
