you made one statement that did not make too much sense to me; &quot;comfortably enjoying osx security through obscurity,&quot; i wonder if you would explain that comment.
a comment that has been debunked so many times.
with a current market share of over 8%, os x is hardly &quot;obscure&quot; encouraging windows users on a mac to install good av software is always good and i can understand that some people may think that because they are using a mac, which currently has no virus's in the wild, to run windows on, that would be all the protection they would need.
