Western Digital SATA Hard Drive - 640GB Vista Home Premium - 64Bit Gateway desktop. Would someone know of any utility or method to restore a SATA hard drive's factory full capacity size? During partitioning my drive, it went from 595GB (640GB Drive) to only 32GB. Since it is a 64-Bit system, I can't find a utility to restore the drive's full capacity.

First I must have messed up the drive by using the Western Digital Lifeguard Tool on their own drive - ironic. Using the Lifeguard Utility, I did what I had to and checked the BAs. My Native MAX LBA did not match my Current MAX LBA, and I did not know how to change it. I set, in the BIOS, the drive to LBA and the system got up to 137GB. Then I ran the Acronis WD (Western Digital) Edition (free) to check the integrity of the drive. It showed me the following partitions: 32GB, 137Gb and UNUSED 144GB. I opened my Easeus Partition Master to check the drive and found all the full size - it gave me more than the factory, it gave me 610GB instead of the 595GB for a 640GB drive. Am so excited! Thanks for all your help here, I really appreciate all your help and time. You ALL have a wonderful weekend.
