1.1.1	Peter was kind enough to suggest some web sites to look at new internal hard drives to replace the smaller, original HD that is making strange noises occasionally in my old 1.2 ghz 12&quot; iBook after 2 and 1/2 years of constant use.	St
1.1.2	Looking at the variety of brands, speeds, and sizes that these sites say are specifically recommended for my model I noticed two things I might want advice about.	St
1.1.3	Brand... Toshiba and Hitachi seem to be the most common followed by Seagate.	St
1.1.4	Price wise, Toshiba is cheapest, Hitachi and Seagate are more expensive.	St
1.1.5	Any recommendation about brands?	Sug
1.1.6	Speeds... 54,000 rpm and 72,000 were the speeds available.	St
1.1.7	54K being the original speed of the Toshiba HD that came with my iBook.	St
1.1.8	Is there significant advantages to going with a 72K HD?	St
1.1.9	It has faster potential read times... but I imagine a bigger power drain on the battery as well.	St
1.1.10	Also, can an older iBook take full advantage of the faster drive or will throughput of information be limited by the older laptop's mother board, processor, and bus speeds?	St
1.1.11	In other words, can my iBook take full advantage of the faster (and more expensive) HD?	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance for any advice grim	Polite
1.2.1	I've had zero issues with brands until others.	St
1.2.2	As to the speed, I have settled down to giving the nod to 5400 RPM every time.	St
1.2.3	But yes, since the access times are not set by the OS, any OS would gain advantages here.	St
1.2.4	If I were to have all brands available I might make a quick study of the Watts and the seek times of the available units.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I had thought I would go with the 54K drives myself.	St
1.3.2	Question about the watts... how would that be measured?	St
1.3.3	Is that measured as a constant draw on power @ the hard drive's maximum speed over a measured period of time?	St
1.3.4	Is there an industry standard or would each manufacturer have their own way of coming up with the numbers?	St
1.3.5	I imagine the information would only be available from the manufacturer's web site if they thought to post it.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I have to hunt for the specifications from the maker's web site.	St
1.5.2	I don't do this for members because...	St
1.5.3	I just don't.	St
1.5.4	I only share how I do my research.	St
1.5.5	As to the Watts measured, I think some could over analyze here but the data sheets do include idle and active Watts.	St
1.5.6	I think you haven't been reading them is why you asked.	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	...	St
1.6.2	I hadn't got past the web dealers websites yet.	St
1.6.3	I wanted to get an idea of what to look for before I started going to the manufacturer's websites and searching for actual hardware specs.	St
1.6.4	Thanks Bob, You've given me some details to explore further.	St
1.6.5	grim	St
1.7.1	Instead we head to maxtor.com and such.	St
