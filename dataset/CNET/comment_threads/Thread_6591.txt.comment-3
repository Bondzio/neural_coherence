is to get one that has two separate plus 12 volt rails.
One feeds the 4 pin CPU power connector, the other feeds the mobo and drives.
This provides cleaner power to the CPU during high transient conditions.
Don't get confused by seeing the minus 12 volt rail on the supply list [normally 2 amps or less, and no longer used].
You want two Plus 12 volt outputs listed for the supply, each with substantial current capability.
