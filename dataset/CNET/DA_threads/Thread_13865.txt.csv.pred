1.1.1	I have been trying for the past couple of days to network a couple of PC 's .	St
1.1.2	a ) win XP - b ) Win NT .	St
1.1.3	I have b running through a Netgear hub where I have a Laser copier as well .	St
1.1.4	The thing is that the laser copier is identified in the network but the win NT machine is not .	St
1.1.5	I tried to ping one machine from the other and no luck .	St
1.1.6	They seem to not see each other on the network .	St
1.1.7	However when I enter the IP address of the NT machine in the XP one a message flags instantly on both machines , they ca n't shared the same IP .	St
1.1.8	I am not a wizard at all on networking , to my disgrace , but if they are not seeing each other on the network why is this message coming up in both machines simultaneously ?	Ques
1.1.9	Now I realize that in the NT machine there are two protocols installed : TCP/IP & NetBUI while XP does not carry NetBUI anymore .	St
1.1.10	Could this be the bloody reason why XP is not picking up this machine on the network ?	Ques

1.1.12	What suggestions come to your mind guys ?	Ques
1.1.13	Please enlighten me ... Gelson	St
1.2.1	With NBT being the preferred solution , you need to move off Netbeui .	St
1.2.2	Of course , if you want , there are articles about forcing Netbeui into XP .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Forget about Netbeui .	St
1.3.2	Focus on workgroup names set as the same and file sharing being enabled .	St
1.3.3	Also look for those link lights on the NICs flashing .	St
1.3.4	Check your IPs , see that they are not the same .	St
