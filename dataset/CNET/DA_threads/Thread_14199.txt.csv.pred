1.1.1	I bought a Dell Dimension 8400 series about 6 months ago.	St
1.1.2	So far its been running smoothly but I have been considering upgrading and possibly installing new hardware.	St
1.1.3	I have been able to find most of the systems specs at the Dell site but for the life of me I cant seen to find anything on the motherboard.	St
1.1.4	I had heard that Dells customer service/tech support had a lot to be desired.	St
1.1.5	Well I found that out first hand, needless to say I still dont know what brand, make or model the motherboard is.	St
1.1.6	Does anybody know who makes Dells boards and how I can find out which board I have.	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	download CPU-Z.	St
1.2.2	Should be the 925X chipset, but not sure mobo manufacturer.	St
1.2.3	Install a new pci-express gfx card.	St
1.2.4	the 7800GTX just came out for $600USD.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	&quot;Does anybody know who makes Dells boards &quot;.	St
1.4.2	Whoever Dell choses.	St
1.4.3	Keep in mind the Dell's are NOT a standard ATX MB so you are &quot;stuck&quot; with it.	St
1.4.4	And your only going to find out what Dell wants you to know.	St
1.4.5	But you can do video cards, hard drives and memory upgades.	St
1.4.6	John	St
1.5.1	I think Intel makes Dell's mobos but it's not standard ATX so your stuck with it.	St
1.5.2	The same goes for the power supply.	St
1.5.3	Adding drives, cards memory, ect.	St
1.5.4	is ok though.	St
1.5.5	This is why I don't like dell anymore.	St
1.5.6	Use CPU-Z.	St
