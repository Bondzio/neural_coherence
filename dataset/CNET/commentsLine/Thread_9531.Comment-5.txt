there will be those that love intel and those that love amd as well as in which configuration do you want to test things.
i think at the moment amd's stuff is a little better in some areas.
however, intel has their core 2 duos coming out soon that may change things around given the touted benchmarks but they are potentially suspect since there were so many things restricted in the tests done on the core 2 duos i think.
iirc, there was an article that said if you needed a pc now to get an amd am2 socket one but if you could wait there may be better stuff available soon.
