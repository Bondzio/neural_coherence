Yes they are Nice People, They registered my complaint without any problems.
The Board is closest to the Asus is the a7v8x-LA, which I presume they do offer a BIOS for, is there anyone ith alot of skill out there that can make this work?
But my point is they should not be allowed to restrict hardware, I paid 800 fo a computer with a Socket 754 Motherboard, which means it can have upto 3700+, and I am going to get it one way or another with HP's help or not.
Im just begging if there is anyone out there who can write bioses, can they please help poor hp owners?
