The problem I'm having is that my hard drive, IBM Desktop S/N A4DBP79F, and secondary optical device is IDE/PATA and I have installed a new DVD writer that is SATA. When I change drive settings in the bios to enhanced and re-boot the system will not see my hard drive. I then changed the drive setting to legacy and chose PATA Pri/SATA Sec and the system will re-boot properly but it will not see the secondary optical device. There are multiple pin configurations on the hard drive and I was wondering if the jumpers could possibly be the problem. Its set to master now.

That is, if you enable PATA EMULATION then you may lose a PATA port. If you leave the BIOS in full SATA mode, XP will create headaches for the uninitiated or those that didn't research this. And as you discovered the enhanced mode is just trouble. I suggest you leave it in normal modes and install the motherboard and sata drivers for this OS. Bob
