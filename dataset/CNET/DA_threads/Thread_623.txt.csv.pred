1.1.1	My parents have told me they 'd like to help me with getting my hard drives backed up .	St
1.1.2	I think the best solution would be to get a hard drive in an external enclosure , and clone the drives and partitions .	St
1.1.3	Right now I have an 80GB HDD ( which has a ~37GB XP partition with & lt ; 13GB free , a ~28GB W7 Beta partition with & lt ; 20GB free , and the rest is Ubuntu Linux , which I ca n't see the capacity remaining from in Windows ) , a 250GB HDD with ~10GB free , and a 750GB HDD ( with a 509GB partition with ~65GB free , a 127GB partition with ~66GB free , and a ~61GB partition with & lt ; 5GB free ) .	St
1.1.4	The 61GB partition on the 750G drive is a backup made a couple months ago at my parents ' request of the 127GB partition ( and squeezed down so it did n't take more space on the drive than needed ) , so I probably do n't need to back that up , unless you all think I should .	St
1.1.5	Also , I 'm probably going to be needing to purchase a new hard drive ( but I 'll be paying for that myself ) for main data storage in the not-too-distant future , as I 'm starting to run a bit low on space on the drives I have .	St
1.1.6	( When I do , I 'll want to retire the 80GB drive , and move all its partitions onto the 250GB drive ( and juggle other things around as necessary ) .	St
1.1.7	In the meantime , I 'm hoping that a 1TB drive would be sufficient to back up the drives I now have ( which is actually 1.08TB , but there 's more than .08TB of available space ) .	St
1.1.8	One thing though , while I 'm willing to shrink partitions on the backup media as necessary , I 'd rather not have to do that .	St
1.1.9	So.. after that long-winded rambling ... what would you recommend for a backup solution ?	Ques
1.1.10	A drobo is NOT an option , due to being several times over our price range .	St
1.1.11	Personally , I 'd prefer to get an internal 1TB drive that 's good quality ( looking at the $ 90-110 price range ) and mount it in a good quality external enclosure ( would like to get one under $ 30 ) .	St
1.1.12	Or , would I be better off just getting an external drive that is sold as such , and if so , will I be able to swap out the drive for a larger one later as needed without voiding the warranty ( assuming I do the swapping out myself , not taking it to someone else to do it ) ?	Ques
1.1.13	As for the interface , my computer has USB 2.0 and Firewire ports ( mobo is a Gigabyte GA-MA69G-S3H ) , and I would consider adding an eSATA card .	St
1.1.14	I really would like to keep the total price as low as is reasonably possible , but I do n't want to get junk .	St
1.1.15	( If the total price is $ 85 , I 'd be worried , but if it is upwards of $ 150 , I think my parents would balk at buying it for me . )	St
1.1.16	As far as where to buy , I like NewEgg ( yes I have to pay sales tax , but one of their distribution facilities is within 120 miles of here ) , but if you can recommend another vendor I 'd be willing to consider it .	St
1.2.1	Buy your own and put it into an enclosure of your choice .	St
1.2.2	What are your plans when this drive crashes ?	Ques
1.3.1	That 's what I was thinking - enclosure + HDD .	St
1.3.2	What do you mean by when the drive crashes - you referring to one of my existing drives , or this drive ( which will be used as backups ) ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 'm looking at getting a 1TB drive - do n't want to pay more than $ 100-110 for the drive itself .	St
1.3.4	As for the enclosure , I 'd like to keep it down below $ 30 , but could go a little higher if necessary to get something that 's good quality .	St
1.3.5	What should I look for in an enclosure ?	Ques
1.3.6	I 'd like eSATA support , but if it 's not worth the price premium I wo n't worry about it ( although I will require USB 2.0 . )	St
1.3.7	My mobo supports firewire as well , but preliminary research has revealed that 1394 support has a significant price premium .	St
1.3.8	Also , what would be good for making sure it does n't run too hot ?	Ques
1.3.9	Should I go with an aluminum enclosure , one with a fan , one with vents on the case , or combo or what ?	Ques
1.3.10	Also a few I 've seen on newegg come with backup software , and a few that have eSATA support come with SATA to eSATA brackets ( which would use one of the 4 SATA ports on my mobo .	St
1.3.11	( I have 1 SATA drive in there right now , and hope to purchase a 2nd ( separate from this backup solution ) ( 1.5TB or 2TB ) internal SATA drive ( plus another of equal size to back THAT up ) within the next few months or so . )	St
1.3.12	If it did n't come with an eSATA bracket , then I 'd have to either use USB ( or 1394 if it supported it but those are a bit pricey I think ) , or spend $ 15-25 on an add-on card with an eSATA port .	St
1.3.13	Some of the products I 'm looking at : internal HDDs - 1 TB ( 1-2 ) enclosures : ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 - reg $ 49.99 , $ 20 off w/promo code through 4-29 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7-10 ) ( if necessary - i.e .	St
1.3.14	if I get an eSATA enclosure that does n't come with an eSATA bracket ) : eSATA brackets : ( 1-4 ) , ( 5-6 ) add-on controllers In each above category , I 'd only buy one item , and do n't want to buy more than I need ( for example if an enclosure comes with an eSATA bracket , I wo n't be buying a separate add-on bracket or card ) .	St
1.4.1	Most of the enclosures say they support up to 1 TB , or up to 1.5 TB .	St
1.4.2	Was that only because that was the largest hard drives available at the time they tested it , or will it actually NOT support HDDs larger than that ?	Ques
1.4.3	I do n't want to have to get a new enclosure later when it comes time to get a 2TB , 2.5TB , 3TB , etc HDD .	St
1.4.4	I 've narrowed down my choice of enclosures to this one .	St
1.4.5	It 's a USB 2.0 & eSATA enclosure with good ventilation , a fan , and is on sale until Wednesday ( 4-29 ) for $ 30 ( normally $ 50 ) .	St
1.4.6	If I miss out on that deal , I 'd be looking at either these two eSATA + USB 2.0 or this USB 2.0 enclosure .	St
1.4.7	As for the two with eSATA , they do n't come with the eSATA bracket , so I 'd be looking at getting one of these or these .	St
1.4.8	I 've decided not to get a separate add-on controller card at this time , as it appears that my mobo supports hot swap SATA .	St
1.4.9	As for the hard drive itself ...	St
1.4.10	I 'm thinking that this Western Digital WD1001FALS - $ 105 would be fine , or do you think this WD WD10EADS - $ 95 is good enough ?	Ques
1.5.1	Just find a case that will support the drive you want .	St
1.5.2	My preference is Seagate because of their PMR technology .	St
1.5.3	Perpendicular Magnetic Recording takes up less space on the platter making data access faster .	St
1.5.4	I have at least 8 drives between my PCs , and my NAS and they are all Seagate PMR .	St
1.5.5	I can tell you this , for a fact , they are faster than standard LMR drives .	St
1.6.1	I 've heard that some people have had issues with the 1.5TB ( and possibly 1TB ) Seagate drives , but that the Western Digital ones are good .	St
1.6.2	I 've had excellent experience with Western Digital myself - I have an 80GB WD800JB that I bought probably back sometime between 2002 and 2004 or so , and have had absolutely no problems with it .	St
1.6.3	( When I get another 1.5 or 2 TB ( or higher capacity if it 's available AND the price/GB ratio is favorable relative to the curve ) internal HDD sometime this year to expand capacity , I plan to retire the 80GB , and move everything onto the 250GB WD2500JB , or possibly onto the 750GB WD7500AAKS .	St
1.6.4	( If I get a 2TB or higher capacity drive , I 'll probably retire both the 80 and 250 gb drives . )	St
1.6.5	Do you think this Rosewill RX-358-S enclosure is a good one ?	Ques
1.6.6	It looks like it has good ventilation , has a fan , aluminum case ( for heat dissipation ) , supports USB 2.0 and eSATA ( and comes with an eSATA bracket ) , and is on sale for $ 30 ( with promo code ) through tomorrow .	St
1.6.7	As for the drive , I 'm mainly looking at the 2 drives in my post above yours , but if I go a bit cheaper there 's a Seagate ( that 's only rated 3/5 - the more expensive of the WDs I linked is rated 5/5 , and I really do n't want to go under 4/5 ) , Samsung ( not rated ) and Hitachi ( 4/5 rating ) .	St
1.6.8	Would any of those be ok , or in this case would it be best to go with the $ 105 Western Digital ?	Ques
1.6.9	Reliability is extremely important to me - I expect this drive to last at least as long as my 80GB drive has lasted , if not longer .	St
