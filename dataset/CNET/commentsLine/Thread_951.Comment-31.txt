what you say is true.
what i just learned is the larger the cluster size the more waste there is on the drive.
ntfs starts with a smaller cluster size.
(4k), so there is less waste.
my fat32 started with a larger cluster size, (16k).
so it is faster but there is more waste.
i have another hard drive, partitioned in half with 2 ntfs storage partitions.same amount of gigs.
one is set to 4k and the other is set to 64k cluster size.
the one set to 4k is slower but has more space.
the one set to 64 is faster but has a lot more wasted space, so it is actually smaller.
