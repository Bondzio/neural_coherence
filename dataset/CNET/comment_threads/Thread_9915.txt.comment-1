I am looking for a server to back up all my computers and to store all the media files for my HTPC.
I also want it to run utorrent.
I am not interested in building a NAS server, I want a small server to fit on my already cluttered desk.
My network knowledge is in between basic and novice.
I'm looking for some suggestions for a network storage device for home use.
Thanks.
