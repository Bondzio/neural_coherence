<s> Hi Im having major problems with my router. </s>
<s> We have a linksys WRT54GS, with a desktop connected to it via cable and my laptop running on wireless. </s>
<s> Things were ok until a few weeks ago, when my connection started dropping more often (but it would immediately connect by itself a few seconds later). </s>
<s> But now, I cant even connect to the internet. </s>
<s> Heres the detail: At first, I couldnt even connect to the router, although my laptop would pick up the signal. </s>
<s> The router is set to have a network key (WPA or WPA II), so I played around with the connection properties and changed the network authentication to OPEN from SHARED and left data encryption to WEP. </s>
<s> Now this time I can connect to the router, access the routers setting and access the other computer, but cant browse the net. </s>
<s> Just for ease, Ive disabled the routers security mode now. </s>
<s> Im running Windows XP Security Update 2, and I have a Intel Wireless Network card 802.11 b/g. </s>
<s> Did I mention HOW ANNOYING this is? </s>
<s> I also had another linksys, the WRT54G, and that thing died on me too a while ago. </s>
<s> And yes, I have the latest firmware. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone. </s>
<s> Does this happen with both computers? </s>
<s> Does this happen only with wireless on the notebook? </s>
<s> Scan for viruses and spyware. </s>
<s> If only a wireless problem, try a different broadcast channel (1, 6, or 11). </s>
<s> Results? </s>
<s> The problem was only with the laptop. </s>
<s> The pc worked fine, it was just the laptop that couldn't suft despite being connected to the router. </s>
<s> For SOME reason, I was playing around with the connection settings, and even though i didn't change anything at the end, when i disconnected the router and the modem for 30 seconds (I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE AT LEAST A BIZZILLION TIMES) it started working again. </s>
<s> I'm guessing there was a problem with my IP??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I have problems trying to connect to a shared printer and I can identify with your problem: some solution, if can get on the internet, go www.linksys.com/check site. </s>
<s> From there you will be able to have the router through this site, just follow the directions. </s>
<s> Or call the linksys tech support at 1-800-326-7114. </s>
<s> i have the same router same setup (2 pc's hard wired, wireless laptop) and had the same problem. </s>
<s> im new to wireless and had just bought a laptop and router. </s>
<s> worked fine for a few weeks then started dropping out more and more. </s>
<s> called linksys and went step by step thru configuration and it has been ok since if i remember it had to do with the channel it was on. </s>
<s> call them and set it up right. </s>
<s> should be fine still cant share the damn printer though lol good luck </s>
<s> I feel your pain. </s>
<s> I still can't get any connection to my printer either. </s>
<s> Calling linksys about this annoying problem was a waste of time and effort. </s>
<s> I have A Dell Demension 3000 and a linksys WRT54GS. </s>
<s> If you have a shared printer on a computer, did you tell the personal firewall on that computer to allow other computers to access it? </s>
<s> Maybe set up a &quot;trusted&quot; range of IP addresses in that firewall? </s>
<s> - or - Is it a network printer that connects directly to the router or via a print server? </s>
<s> the printer is connected to the computer </s>
<s> If you are not aware of it, Netstumbler is a great, FREE, site survey tool. </s>
<s> It will tell you how stong the signal is and it will tell you all of the other networks within range of your wireless card. </s>
<s> It tells you the channel they are using and whether they are encrypted or not. </s>
<s> If you are lucky, you will only see devices on channel 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Anybody using channels other than this are rookies and need some education on wireless. </s>
<s> This is a more scientific approach to choosing a random channel. </s>
