Led...this refers to the back lighting.
http://ledmonitors.info/ Your call if you need such a thing.
Multiple docs on the screen at the same time.
If your going to maintain the format and have print you can see......I suspect you will need a very large monitor.
24 inch seems to be the biggest in off the shelf stuff......I have doubts two readable docs are going to fit on that screen.......unless you have teenage eyeballs.
