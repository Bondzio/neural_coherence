The dual-core Athlon 64 as displayed was on a socket 939 board.
If you are looking at 64-bit, you are classed as a high end user.
You'll find that video editing, games and more on Windows 2000/XP/Linux/other OSes will perform better on dual CPUs.
Putting two CPUs in one socket is cheaper than DUAL CPU boards.
