so how long will it be for these chips to fall in price?
id figure the drop would be substantial, is there a new chip coming out at the end of the month?
so i assume you are saying that this trip would run better than the 4200 or 4000 x2.
if i do get it, is there a motherboard i should look for that would work well with it?
also, any reccomendations on memory?
i wanted to get 2gb.
thanks, ~j
