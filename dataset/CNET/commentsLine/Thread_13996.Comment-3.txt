1. if it worked after you rebooted and got windows up, try this.
click start, run and then dxdiag.
click ok, then click on the rightmost tab.
click override and put the number 60 in.
ok your way out.
2. if windows didn't display, reboot and select safe mode.
now select 800x600 and 60hz in display properties.
i will not give a step by step on this since there is no standard here.
