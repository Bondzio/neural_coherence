Here are the specs: DVD Drive: SONY DW-G120A-B2, DVD/CD RW Drive unit OS: Win XP SP2 I tried locating the latest driver from Sony's website, but my particular model is not listed at all on the site. From another site, I located a driver which is MYS3WIN, but my existing driver is MYS5WIN, so I have hesitated in experimenting. I would appreciate any help in getting my DVD drive running! Thanks, Sanjay.
