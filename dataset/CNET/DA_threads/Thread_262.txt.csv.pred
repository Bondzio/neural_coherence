1.2.1	Buy a replacement power supply , that 's really the only option normally available in these cases .	St
1.3.1	if its just dirty clean fan , ive done that find a mom pop shop get a bad power supply replace fan	St
1.4.1	Replace the fan , of course .	St
1.4.2	However , replacing the fan maybe 1/2 of the problem as prolonged operation of an intermit fan causes & quot ; stress & quot ; on the p/s componets and there 's a 50/50 chance it will fail entirely .	St
1.4.3	While , the replacing the fan makes sense , replacing the p/s is a more practical solution besides a new p/s plus the included fan , you have a chance to increase the wattage of p/s if available .	St
1.4.4	The choice is yours .	St
1.4.5	The fan size is usually 80 or 90mm in size or 3-4in.. good luck -- -- -Willy	St

1.5.2	You talked of a powersupply fan .	St
1.5.3	Is there more than one fan inside ?	Ques
1.6.1	It sounds like your power supply fan is just beginning to go .	St
1.6.2	If you replace it now now chances are your power supply is fine because the rpms on the fan have n't dropped too much .	St
1.7.1	There is only one fan , but trying to find a replacement and putting one in can be more trouble than just replacing the powersupply .	St
