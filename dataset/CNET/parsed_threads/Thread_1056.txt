<s> Does anyone have this printer because mine has just decided to only allow me to print 1 page at a time. </s>
<s> This is since I printed something on card (not successfully) and since then, it just jams up after printed the first page when the printer is first turned on. </s>
<s> If I turn it off and on again,it will print a first page but then gets jammed. </s>
<s> It has an automatic paper sensor but for some reason that is not working. </s>
<s> Is there a way of getting into these machines or do I have to assume that I just chuck it out and buy another </s>
<s> Your complaint is one that is heard often. </s>
<s> A side effect of not paying 500 plus dollars for a printer. </s>
<s> With such low prices, the repair costs more than a new printer. </s>
<s> Since it's broken, my advice is to not fret about breaking it but to DIVE IN and try to look at it. </s>
<s> First step I do is to remove any staples, tape, torn strips of paper from the machine's internals and then a light vacuuming and close it up with a damp cloth to wipe down the rollers. </s>
<s> Sometimes I find the item. </s>
<s> A rare bird was some HP that had no real CPU in the printer and all commands were done from the host computer. </s>
<s> Including paper feeding. </s>
<s> A flaw in the host could cause multiple sheets to be fed, but I doubt this in today's machines. </s>
<s> You can try removing and reinstalling the drivers for a last fun thing to try. </s>
