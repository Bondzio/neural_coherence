<s> Hi everyone I need help with windows 98 during bootup. </s>
<s> I'm sure many of you have had a black screen and curser blinking top left to the screen. </s>
<s> I tried my F-keys and so on to no avail. </s>
<s> All I want to do is go for a clean reinstall 98 from my cd. </s>
<s> Can anyone please walk me through the process. </s>
<s> Your help is appreciated. </s>
<s> I head maybe booting up from CD drive in the Bios? </s>
<s> Not sure. </s>
<s> Thanks Christian </s>
<s> and the boot order available. </s>
<s> In 98 most will use a 98 boot floppy, fdisk/format and install from their cd. </s>
<s> Some have a bootable 98 cd, in which case the boot order of the Bios needs to reflect that choice of media. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Chris </s>
<s> thats the best advice i can give u </s>
<s> Please don't post such silly remarks in the forum. </s>
<s> People post here seeking help. </s>
<s> They don't want to hear such as that. </s>
