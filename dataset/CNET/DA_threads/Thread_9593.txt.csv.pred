1.1.1	Finally ready to purchase (building one is not an option for me) an HP system: XP MediaCenter2005 OS A64 X2 4200+ 512MB DDR-400MHz dual channel SDRAM (2x256) -OR- 1GHz.... PCI-E - will be adding XFX 7800 GT Question 1: would it be better to go with the 512 (2x256)of their cheap RAM and add 2x512 of decent RAM for 1.5 GHz -OR- get the 1 GHz they offer (aren't there RAM limitations -speed or whatever- when using an HP -or any ''stock''- mobo - does it matter what kind of RAM I use then)?	St
1.1.2	Question 2: I read in a forum post that the 7800GT needs two power supply connections.	St
1.1.3	Is that only for SLI use - will I have any problems using one of these GPUs with this board?	St
1.1.4	(old HP PC worked well with a regular nVidia 6600.	St
1.1.5	As a novice (w/ no computer guru friends) in a tiny town, I really appreciate the feedback and advice from all you guys, Kaman	St
1.2.1	I can't see much advantage in adding 1 gig of &quot;better&quot; RAM on top of 1/2 gig of cheaper.	St
1.2.2	It's going to scale back to the performance of the slowest module.	St
1.2.3	Stick with 2 sticks for dual channel and 1 gig is probably fine.	St
1.2.4	If you find later on that you want more just get two more of the same modules but I doubt you'll see much improvement in preformance.	St
1.3.1	just wondering, but as for your current plans: yes, he is right, it will run as slow as the slowest module (or in some rare cases try to overclock the slowest module, the HP BIOS won't because it plays it safe, but i've seen DFI BIOS' do it, then again that's on a $170 mobo designed for OC'ing(that was also known to have issues with basic operation)) yeah aside from that, I can't remember off the top of my head if the 7800GT will use 1 or 2 power connections, but i'm guessing it probably does use 2, then again it might only use, either way just ensure the PSU has enough oomph for it (BEFORE YOU BUY THE 7800GT) another note, it seems like your wanting a gaming machine don't get the MCE OS, just get XP Pro	St
1.4.1	...as to not building my own - two reasons really: -I don't have a good enough grasp to trust my own abilities even with help from forums such as this.	St
1.4.2	-I'm too lazy.	St
1.4.3	I know that sounds like I'm a jerk, but I'm just being honest.	St
1.4.4	Seems like there're too many variables, things to consider, things to go wrong, and it'd take alot of work/research.	St
1.4.5	I feel overwhelmed - all the details.	St
1.4.6	...if the 7800GT requires two power connections (not sure how that works), does that mean it wouldn't work with a stock HP mobo?	St
1.4.7	Oh, system comes with 400watt PSU, that'll handle the 7800, right?	St
1.4.8	...I've grown to really like my current Media Center PC - moving it to the entetainment center to use with big screen TV.	St
1.4.9	I like the MCE OS (isn't it an XPpro hybrid) for all my photos, videos, music, TV, etc.	St
1.4.10	Management is so easy with this OS - saves alot of time.	St
1.4.11	Want to get a reg pavilion 4100e A64 X2 4200 with MCE so I can utilize a couple extra tuners for TV.	St
1.4.12	(MCE uses DVR-MS files - huge files) can record on new machine to media drive and pop it into the media drive bay to watch on old one with big screen.	St
1.4.13	...as for gaming, I've got a puny nVidia 6600 (not GT) and with this HP MCE PC, I play COD, MOH, BF2 and Far Cry with no probs, just a glitch here and there on BF2 'cause of the GPU I'm sure.	St
1.4.14	Had good luck with gaming on this OS.	Polite
1.4.15	...as for RAM, should I get the 2x256 (HP wants $100.00 to upgrade from that to 1gig) and then buy some value grade (whatever they call it) Corsair or something.	St
1.4.16	-OR- replace it with 2x512 of good RAM so it won't be limited by cheap RAM (or will the mobo probably slow it as much as the cheap RAM)?	St
1.4.17	bet you're sorry you responded now, lol.	Polite
1.4.18	Thanks, Kaman	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Upgrading the oem HP is going to take as much work as building your own.	St
1.6.2	YOu would need a new psu for the 7800Gt.	St
1.6.3	Definitely.	St
1.6.4	Will a regular ATX PSU even fit in the HP cases, if not, you're in for a lot of trouble.	St
1.6.5	You're upgrading the ram right?	St
1.6.6	That would be a logical choice.	St
1.6.7	If anything is broken by your actions, the HP warranty would be void.	St
1.6.8	Roger	St
1.7.1	Ugrading RAM and a new PSU is far less work than building your own.	St
1.7.2	Are you sure that 400watt is not enough?	St
1.7.3	I know some are reporting issues w/ a 350watt, but I think the manufacturer (was gonna go w/ XFX) recommends 400watts.	St
1.7.4	Don't wanna replace the PSU - could get a diff GPU - maybe a 6800 series.	Sug
1.8.1	Is that because of the wattage -OR- just because it's HPs version of a 400watter?	St
1.9.1	Too many hardware changes can result in XP failing to boot.	St
1.9.2	The OS that comes preinstalled is proprietary to that system, and may not respond to so many changes.	St
1.9.3	Resulting in having to purchase the retail or another OEM version of the OS.	St
1.10.1	its much too low...even if it was from another brand.	St
1.11.1	blah blha balbh	St
