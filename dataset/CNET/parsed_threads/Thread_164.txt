<s> I am going to buy the Canopus ADVC110 for my Mac OS Leopard. </s>
<s> I just don't know which other cables are needed to make the connection from capture card to TV, and from capture card to computer. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> To connect the ADVC110 to your Mac, you will need a 6pin to 6pin Firewire cable. </s>
<s> To connect the ADVC110 to your video equipment, camera, VCR, etc. </s>
<s> you will need whatever cables fit the output of those devices. </s>
<s> Digital (DV) camcorders usually have a Firewire cable, (aka IEEE1394 or iLink) that will connect to the ADVC. </s>
<s> To connect the ADVC110 to your TV, you will need either an RCA cable or an S-Video cable, depending on what your TV will support. </s>
<s> All of the above information is on the Canopus site. </s>
<s> What are you planning to use the device for? </s>

<s> I've connected the Canopus ADVC110 to my mac but what program is needed to actually capture the image? </s>
<s> I am trying to tranfer old VHS home videos to DVD. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> You know what never mind I just figured it out. </s>
<s> I opened iMovie and it is capturing it for me. </s>
<s> Now I'll just have to figure out how to burn it to DVD. </s>
<s> Once you have finished capturing your VHS stuff into iMovie, done any necessary editing and added titles or such, save the project and then share it. </s>
<s> Under Share, you will see an option to send it to iDVD. </s>
<s> Here you can add menu's, if necessary, and add a few bits and pieces to make it look like a &quot;real&quot; DVD when inserted into a DVD player. </s>
<s> Once you are set, hit the burn button and take the rest of the night off. </s>
<s> I usually leave mine overnight and it's ready when I get up. </s>
<s> Best not to be doing anything else when iDVD is rendering, compressing and otherwise doing its stuff. </s>
<s> Good Luck P </s>
<s> Anyone know what software to use with the Canopus ADVC110 to use it as just a video input so I can plug my TiVo Series3 HD directly into my Macbook so I don't need a TV. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Theronjames, If you want to watch TV on your Mac through your Canopus, you have two options: 1) Use Quicktime Pro. </s>
<s> 2) Use iMovie. </s>
<s> You don't need to actually capture video to your hard-drive. </s>
<s> The software will simply show you what is being fed into the computer via the Canopus. </s>
<s> For both options, plug your video device into the Canopus, then use a Firewire cable from the Canopus to the Mac. </s>
<s> Use whichever option you want above. </s>
<s> I am currently watching FOX Business News on my Mac-mini, taking RCA video and audio from a VCR (which has a TV cable plugged in) and I am using QT Pro. </s>
<s> I choose &quot;New Movie Recording&quot; and AT opens up and shows the video signal. </s>
<s> The only problem with either of my options is that they don't give you full screen video like a TV. </s>
<s> The TV screen image is controlled by the software and it's smaller than full-screen. </s>
<s> Just google for &quot;vidi video capture&quot; and play a little with the program, excelent features, even the wide screen shows can be adapted with this software. </s>
<s> I've another problem, exact the opposite, I want to send my lap top screen to my tv using the canopus 110, any ideas? </s>
<s> I've used my wife's Mac laptop on vacation to watch DVDs on the hotel's TV. </s>
<s> I didn't need the Canopus. </s>
<s> I simply bought a cable that plugged into the Mac's Video-out plug and had RCA and S-Video cables on the other side. </s>
<s> Audio needs a similar converter cable: Mini-plug split into RCA audio plugs. </s>
<s> Some laptops have DVI-out, and you can buy a DVI adapter cable to get video into RCA plugs, etc. </s>
<s> I need to transfer dvds to digital so i can edit. </s>
<s> I have a bunch of footage on dvds and I am trying to figure how how to hook everything up to make it work. </s>
<s> Anyone know how to do it. </s>
<s> I Also have a hdv player. </s>
<s> If I cold even transfer the dvd footage to a dv tape that would work for me also. </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Connect the Firewire output of the Canopus ADVC110 to the Firewire port of your Mac. </s>
<s> Connect the DVD output to the same type of input on the Canopus. </s>
<s> Launch iMovie. </s>
<s> Run the DVD player In iMovie (you did not say what version you have) click the camera icon and then import. </s>
<s> What is playing on the DVD is the imported, in real time, to the Mac. </s>
<s> How's that? </s>
