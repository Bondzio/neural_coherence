<s> Hi All, this I my first post as I have only just joined. </s>
<s> I am currently studying for my network plus and am just starting to get to grips with subnetting. </s>
<s> I have been practising using Class C addresses and thought all was going well until I tried with Class A and Class B. </s>
<s> The problem I have (and I am sure it is pretty basic, but I am struggling a little) is once an octet gets to 255 is the next step 1 or 0 and how does it effect the previous octet? </s>
<s> For example If I have a class B IP address of 172.24.140.254, how would this increment one step at a time? </s>
<s> Would the next step be 172.24.140.255, or 172.24.141.0 or 172.24.141.1. </s>
<s> I am guessing the three of those suggestions are incorrect. </s>
<s> If somebody could give me the next three or four steps from 172.24.140.254 it would clear it up for me. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, and sorry if it is a basic question. </s>

<s> So you get on the internet or read the books. </s>
<s> You might want to try some IP calculator too. </s>
<s> This question is quite old so I'm sure it has plenty of prior discussions. </s>

<s> For the reply </s>
