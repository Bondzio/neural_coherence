It says remove right cartridge and if it still blinks cartridge in side might be broken. I called HP they said out of warentee. I don't remember any cartridge inside the machine besides the 2 ink ones (color and black). What cartridge could they mean. http://teenlounge.org/cnet/bug3/problemhp2.JPG Thanks, Confusimo

At least they are cheap compared to what we paid in times past. Do the self test and clean any contacts you see, try again and then go shopping. Bob

And what cartridge are they talking about anyway? And sinse I'm going shopping what HP is ok. Same style like HP-5440 the lady onn the phone was offering. All those kind will never last me more than 3 years? Or is there 1 that can last me 10 years or more? Thanks, Confusimo

It draws about 1400 Watts when printing at about 8 pages a minute but it's certainly hanging in there. I paid the HP employee price on a refurb of 1,000 bucks. Deal or no deal? Bob

If the light remains lit(non-blinking) ink cart you removed is the a problem. If the led continues to blink, then the remaining ink cart still mounted is the problem one, buy a replacement for the one that it refers to. Review your error again: http://teenlounge.org/cnet/bug3/problemhp2.JPG Does it make sense now? tada -----Willy
