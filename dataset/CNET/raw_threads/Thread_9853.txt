However, Dell had one a few weeks ago that outmatched anything I have ever seen from them for the price, http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=61303&messageID=744946 Apparently they were wanting to move their Pent 4 5xx 8400 systems to make way for the new 8400 6xx systems with the new 64-bit support. Course' Dell changes their free setups and juggle their prices every week, so it's a waiting game with them to get the best prices. Velocity Vector SX-V Value is also a good deal within your price range. However, they have not switched yet to the Pent 4, 6xx (EM64T). I would hold off for many weeks to search for the best PC for the dollar, and keep an eye weekly around Wednesdays for a good 8400 from Dell for $1400.

(Make sure it's got plenty of room for expansion!) 2) Wait until you have another $400 (more of less) and then buy something higher up the food chain. I hope this helps you.

Getting a good system from them is like winning the lottery. You might be lucky, but you might not. You know they're being sued in California, right? If you don't believe me, you can always check things out at www.complaints.com. Just type in &quot;Dell&quot;, and see for yourself.

I tend to like eMachine(high end models). Further, if you have a system build for you, it usually offers the greatest flexibility in order to update and maintain a level of freshness for continued use. But, since you want a decent gaming system, you pretty much paint yourself into a corner, it maybe better to wait and save some more $$ in order to at least start out with a decent system rather than compromise too much. Still, a generic system at $1400 will go a long ways, just be sure you can upgrade, also have as much ram installed NOW in order to take advantage of it as you're best bet plus a decent cpu. Also, keep in mind a very good power supply is a MUST!, it is takken for granted and so much depends on its operation, thus get a good one(namebrand). enjoy -----Willy

I know the P4 guys will complain but, oh well. You could built one for yourself, with a $1400 you easly get AMD64fx processor with 1gb of memory, screaming video card. If your interested in going this route just repost and I'll post some links. John

In my humble opinion- www.ibuypower.com You can get whatever you want for cheaper than anywhere else I have found. People have recomended monarch computers, and I checked it out... its not quite as cheap and VERY confusing if you don't know EXACTLY what you want. Make sure to upgrade your power supply from the stock case, other than that, pretty much anything you will get is good quality. Also- what games/types of games, are you gonna be playing?
