ran iefix with no error message, and i have never downloaded kazaa or it's ilk.
actually, i used the wrong term when i said &quot;error message&quot;.
i am actually getting the normal timed out message on all pages i try to enter, but if i restart the modem connection i am able to operate normally.
i also use a fully updated and activated version of nav 2002 and no one else has access to my machine.
i do not open .exe files from anyone unless i am expecting them.
can only assume trojan got on machine while surfing news or retailer sites, but don't know why nav didn't alert me.
