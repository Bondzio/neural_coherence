Downloading PDG pages from the web are interrupted also.
All pages of print from the web are interrupted.
If I go to my home page, CNBC, it isn't interrupted but it probably takes more than 10 seconds to load because there's such a lot of content.
The last things to load are the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P figures and then I can go to other articles or videos offereb by the site.
Another thing I've noticed is that while the my computer seems to be stalled or the download is still going on, I can move my mouse arrow around but neither the left or right buttons work nor does the wheel word.
In addition, the arrow doesn't change into an hourglass to indicate it is downloading.
