i know a shredder isn't a true peripheral but it should be in every office, so .
.
.
i had a gbc shredder that worked okay for a year or so before dying, and these royals i see on ebay are not well reviewed.
i want something that will handle all those credit card offers without having to open them.
--and erase cd's too.
any suggestions?
thanks!
