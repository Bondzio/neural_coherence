<s> I have difficulty connecting the DSL modem through this unit so thatI can not get into the internet. </s>
<s> I can get in when I go directly, but when I try to go through the router connected to the main computer with a cable, I can not get in. </s>
<s> I get an error message (Failed to load Tap). </s>
<s> I have ZoneAlarm, but have disabled it. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Zonealarm can't be disabled. </s>
<s> &quot; Zone Labs, maker of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. </s>
<s> The company says its own products are locked down in such a way that third-party applications can't disable firewall protection without uninstalling the software. </s>
<s> &quot; - http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,117380,00.asp This issue has been a nagging issue for years. </s>
<s> &quot;Tech&quot; has uninstalled hundreds of Zone Alarm installs to get networking up and running when Zone Alarm still works after we flip the disable setting. </s>
<s> At least they are noting the issue now. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You may need to update the firmware and drivers for such products. </s>
<s> I often find that they don't work out of the box. </s>
