And ccleaner has a nice feature where you can go thru your startup in the tools section (they don't put them in your startup folder anymore), and individually remove startup processes. Careful not to remove your antivirus or anything like that though. Best to open up Google and do a search on each process, and see what it tells ya.

Either try getting someone you know who knows what they are doing to look at it for you or alternatively take it to a computer shop and ask them what if anything you can do with it. Not the best advice and probably not what you wanted to hear but i think probably the most sensible in this case. Sheepy
