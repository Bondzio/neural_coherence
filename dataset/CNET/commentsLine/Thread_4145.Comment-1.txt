i have a network with the following components: toshiba satellite 1005-s157 laptop w/xp dlink dfe 690txd nic for laptop dlink di 524 wireless router (using wired connections only) sbc dsl speedstream 5100 modem win 98 desktop with compaq nc3121 fast ethernet nic i also use zone alarm and avg and frequently check for spyware various ways .
turning off the firewall completely does not help after turning on my computers, sometimes i am able to get internet access and sometimes not.
i can power cycle the modem and/or router and get it (sometimes this takes several tries but ultimately i can get on).
the laptop occasionally will tell me a lan connection is unplugged (nic lights go out) and then a few seconds later lights come on internet is restored.
ive tried a different router (new) and a different nic (new) for the laptop but get the same symptoms.
ive tried setting up the network again also but still no changes.
sometimes when i turn on a pc i will get an internet connection and sometimes not.
i generally get better luck with the laptop than the desktop.
i also can usually get immediate internet connection by plugging a computer directly into the modem and leaving out the router (again, the laptop does a little better than the desktop).
i can get what i need but its annoying and i feel like im either being stupid or being messed with by the cyber gods.
the only common item seems to be the modem.
any suggestions would be appreciated.
