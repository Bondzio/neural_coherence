well, i took the tech's advice and got the pci adapter card and that seems to have fixed the problem, he indicated the sata on-board connections may not be working, not sure how but... after all this, my internet connection got messed up somehow.
i could ping sites, but i still got the &quot;page not found&quot; error.
i spent an hour going over everything; i even reset the winsock and nothing.
i turned off all startup programs, nothing, then disabled the panda security/virus software, poof, works fine now.
thanks for all your help, mark
