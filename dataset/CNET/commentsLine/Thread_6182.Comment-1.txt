im purchasing a hp a6230n computer 2.8 dual core, 3 gig ram, 400 hd going to upgrade the graphics card and the one im thinking about is the 8600 gt oc.
specs looked good, but i want to know how this card will hold up to todays games, toms hardware's tier talked about the 8600 gt but not the oc version so i was wondering if anyone here knew about it.
thanks.
