I have been running a wireless home network for months, then decided to reinstall the Netgear WG311T adapter in one windows XP Home machine, because it disconnected a couple of times. However, when attempting to run setup from the CD, I get an error message: ''Failed to load the windows 2000 setup program. Please make sure that inst2000.dll is in the setup directory. Error Number: 0x80040702 Description: Failed to load dll: Inst.2000 Setup will now terminate.'' I am unable to get past this stage or correct it. Has anyone had an experience of this, please. I am assuming that I will not have to physically remove the card from the board and start from scratch? I am reminded of the old adage, ''If it ain't broke, dont fix it!'' Oh, and the other two machines and the broadband modem/router are all working perfectly.

Please dont ask me how I managed it, but with a combination of the XP service, Wireless Zero Configuration, and manually entering my IP address and DNS address etc. in the adapter connection TCP/IP properties fields, I am accessing the net through my wireless modem/router, and all seems well. Now I am reluctant to shut down this desktop, for fear of losing the settings when rebooting, which happened twice before. So, how would you lock in this combination of hardware and firmware configuration, so that it will be retained next time I start up, please?
