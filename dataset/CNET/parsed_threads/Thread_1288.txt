<s> I have eMachines desktop T6212, with pre-installed LITE-ONs SOHW-1633S DVD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Its a duel layer DVD writer. </s>
<s> I was using it (read/write) since last six months without any problem. </s>
<s> But last week suddenly, it stopped recognizing any DVD (movie, recorded DVD-R) [Actually I tried to clean totally unnecessarily its laser lens using Philips Laser Lens Cleaner disc but not sure, that created this problem]. </s>
<s> Anyway, I reported this problem to eMachines and they shipped me a brand new LITE-ONs SHW-1635S DVD-RW drive that I installed later. </s>
<s> But my problem remained same. </s>
<s> Symptoms of problems are: (1) when a DVD is inserted, windows explorer does not show any file in the drive; in fact, drive never finish reading, it makes noise while trying to read it. </s>
<s> (2) When CD is placed, the same DVD-RW drive reads it quickly and displays the typical small window asking to play with Media Player or Open the Folder etc; windows explorer shows file within the CD too and it is recognized. </s>
<s> (3) When you dont have any disk on the drive and try to click the drive-letter (E: or F: etc) in windows explorer, it typically gives an error message saying Please insert a disk in drive. </s>
<s> For this faulty DVD Drive, such error message does not appear (but other drives in the same PC, gives such message). </s>
<s> (4) In Device Manager, it is rightly recognized and shows working properly. </s>
<s> Above all symptoms are true for both old and new replaced DVD drives. </s>
<s> When I faced the problem with old DVD drive, I tried to change its firmware, with no success. </s>
<s> On suggestion, I tried to restore system from the date when my old DVD drive was working fine; again no success. </s>
<s> I tried all familiar process of uninstalling the DVD-RW from device manager and then restarting the PC when new hardware got recognized and installed; again no success. </s>
<s> I tried the same for new drive too no success again. </s>
<s> Now eMachines is suggesting to do the complete System Restore (at the pre-sale status) that is so undesirable and has no guarantee to the resolution. </s>
<s> I feel, it may not be any hardware or firmware problem. </s>
<s> I dont remember installing any new software since last rightly working DVD drive days. </s>
<s> I cleaned up PC from adware or spyware. </s>
<s> Please help or let me know any site/forum where similar problems were discussed or resolved. </s>

<s> I boot my GEEXBOX CD and see if the DVD plays. </s>
<s> Hint: google.com This lets me find out if there is a hardware or OS issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is a know issue where DVD-RW disks appear to be empty in Windows Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2-based computers. </s>
<s> The Microsoft article I found says that there is a supported hotfix available. </s>
<s> The article adress is: support.Microsoft.com/?kbid=899527 I haven't gotten the fix yet--I don't want to pay $35.00 for a tech support email. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, Windows XP SP1 had a similar problem. </s>
<s> I wrote Nero developers tech support also, but haven't heard back from them. </s>
<s> GeekSquad told me to go to the device manager and unintall the DVDRW drive then restart the PC. </s>
<s> XP will detect it and install the drivers. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having now is it won't detect blank DVDs. </s>
<s> I burned a blank CD this morning but still won't detect blank DVDs. </s>
<s> I burned the bios update for the motherboard from eMachines. </s>
<s> I'm hesitant to use it because they say the update is if you use an Invivia card. </s>
<s> I have an ATI Radeon 1300. </s>
<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> I just discovered that the LITE-ONs SOHW-1633S DVD-RW will recognize an Install CD for a different type of device but still will not recognize ANY OTHER audio CD's or DVD's. </s>
<s> I'm going to experiment with other disk I have. </s>
<s> If I discover any usefull info, I'll post it. </s>
<s> Tom </s>
<s> I'm having a similar problem, however my SOHW1633S will recognize DVDs and blank DVDs, but will NOT recognize any type of CD. </s>
<s> I'll try uninstalling the drive as a previous post suggested, but was wondering if there were any other suggestions out there. </s>
<s> Andy </s>
<s> I have the same piece of crap (T6212 eMachine), though in my case I installed an ATI Radeon 550 video and pumped up the RAM to 1gig. </s>
<s> My DVD will play dvd's, burn CD's and DVD-RW, but it won't burn DVD-R's anymore. </s>
<s> ANy ideas? </s>
<s> Dual lasers...one for CD's...one for DVD's..either could be bad. </s>
<s> If the DVD laser is gone then no DVD's will appear. </s>
<s> If the CD laser is gone then no CD's will appear. </s>
<s> The drive mechanism will work but no disk information will be read. </s>
<s> I've read that the DVD laser is the one that usually goes. </s>
<s> I bought a new DVD burner and had no problem with it. </s>
<s> Now I have an extra CD ROM for my computer. </s>
<s> They replaced the DVDRW and the CDROM. </s>
<s> I told the teck about my problems and he was like &quot;Well, that's wierd&quot;. </s>
<s> I have a home built desktop with the LITE-ONs SOHW-1633S DVD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Symptoms are: 1. </s>
<s> WMP can play CDs, but it lists them as ''unknown'' 2. </s>
<s> My drive can recognize some DVDs (Matrix Reloded for one). </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> For the DVD's it can play, the system either restart, freezes, or begins dumping of physical memory. </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate it if you would tell me the solution to your problem. </s>
<s> Thank you, Ray </s>
<s> When you come to *any* CD drive problem, after many attempts to correct, the &quot;BEST SOLUTION&quot; is to replace. </s>
<s> If you cleaned it out, CD lens cleaner, did re-install, found(install) latest updates, usually after all that and it still doesn't work, replace. </s>
<s> All too often the CD drive after wear&tear or heat damage is kaput. </s>
<s> There is nothing else you can do if it always responds, &quot;can't read or find drive&quot;. </s>
<s> I exclude any OS glitches or similar. </s>
<s> Really... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> This is not the problem...I have just swapped DVD burners, brand spankin' new, and I have the same problem. </s>
<s> suggestions I have tried with no effect: 1) Try difrent media 2) Delete from control panels, reboot 3) Delete upper and lower filters 4) uninstal Nero 5) Run Nero cleanup 6) reinstal the version 6, not 7 Nero 7) Try another burner 8) uninstal (phisically) the DVD-RW and reinstall 9) flash burner 10) get new burner 11) get updated bios 12) reinstall Windows Still same lingering problem, I will also like to add get compleatly new system and do a fresh install to the list as well, as I have done that as well. </s>
<s> Find the owner didn't install latest bios, firmware, motherboard drivers and all that. </s>
<s> Given only what's in your post it's either good old bios, firmware, drivers, configuration issues or dead hardware. </s>
<s> The trick is to take clues when they show up. </s>
<s> Even today I still correct IDE jumper settings weekly. </s>
<s> Tech does so hourly it seems. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a T2245 Emachines and just yesterday the CD and DVD drive both don't show anything. </s>
<s> I go to the properties and the disk says that they are full. </s>
<s> When I put a CD in it reads 0 Bytes. </s>
<s> How can that be? </s>
<s> Simple!! </s>
<s> go to my computer icon right click , properties then hardware and then go to device manager. </s>
<s> Locate ur DVD drive and click un install. </s>
<s> Once done scan again for hardware changes. </s>
<s> Ur drive will be located again. </s>
<s> Now put in ur dvd it should wrk. </s>
