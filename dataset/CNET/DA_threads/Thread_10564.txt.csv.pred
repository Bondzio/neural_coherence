1.1.1	Hi Folks , I have a problem with my LAN .	St
1.1.2	It worked fine until I moved a computer to another room and tried to resume the net .	St
1.1.3	Nothing works .	St
1.1.4	One computer recognizes one other but the other two wo n't recognize either .	St
1.1.5	Someone suggested I disable the firewall , which I did , but no help .	St
1.1.6	He also suggested I ping , but I do n't know how to do this .	St
1.1.7	I have run thru the set-up procedure many times and tried all the different ways .	St
1.1.8	I 'm using a Netgear model # FS605 If any more info is needed please let me know and I 'll try to furnish it .	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Are you using Norton Security Center ?	Ques
1.2.2	If so , disable the whole suite and see if you can see the other computers .	St
1.2.3	If not , check the workgroup names to ensure they are the same	St
1.3.1	If you 're running Windows 2000 or XP on the machines , you can pull up the command prompt by choosing & quot ; Run ... & quot ; from the start menu , typing & quot ; cmd & quot ; and clicking & quot ; OK & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	From the command prompt you can type & quot ; ipconfig & quot ; to view the computer 's IP address , or & quot ; ping & lt ; address & gt ; & quot ; to ping another computer .	St
1.3.3	First , use ipconfig to determine the IP address of each system , and write them all down ( the IP address should begin with & quot ; 10. & quot ; or & quot ; 192.168. & quot ; - as a side note , your default gateway should begin with the same digits and generally end in & quot ; .1 & quot ; ) .	St
1.3.4	The IP addresses of the computers should be the same except for the last octet , i.e .	St
1.3.5	192.168.1.2 , 192.168.1.3 , etc .	St
1.3.6	If they 're different ( 192.168.0.2 , 192.168.1.3 , 10.0.100.2 ) then you have a configuration problem .	St
1.3.7	If any computer has an IP address beginning with & quot ; 169. & quot ; , this is a default Windows-assigned address which indicates that the system ca n't talk to your router to get an IP address .	St
1.3.8	Provided all the IPs are correct , go to each computer and try to ping all the other computers ; for example , if computer B is & quot ; 192.168.1.3 & quot ; , you would go to computer A and type & quot ; ping 192.168.1.3 & quot ; and hit enter .	St
1.3.9	You should get four lines beginning with & quot ; Reply from 192.168.1.3 : & quot ; - if you get & quot ; Request timed out & quot ; , & quot ; Destination net unreachable & quot ; , or another error , either something 's not connected , or one of the computers is n't configured properly .	St
1.3.10	If you are getting & quot ; Request timed out & quot ; , it may indicate the Windows firewall or another security program is active - check the Security Center in each computer 's control panel , & quot ; Windows Firewall & quot ; should be off ( even though it will complain that it 's not recommended ... your router is acting as a firewall and makes the Windows Firewall redundant and next to useless ) .	St
1.3.11	Please reply and let me know if these tips helped .	Sug
1.3.12	If you still are n't able to connect , let me know what your ping responses/error messages were and I can try to help you out some more	St
1.4.1	Netgear normally provides their own drivers .	St
1.4.2	Did you try to reinstall them ?	Ques
