1.1.1	I just ordered these speakers... http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006BK4ZY/qid=1119620874/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-0691789-9968025?v=glance&s=electronics&n=507846 and now I realize it says &quot;whitebox&quot;.	St
1.1.2	What does this mean you think in the case of these speakers?	St
1.1.3	Thanks for any help!	St
1.2.1	Original Equipment Manufacturer.	St
1.2.2	The speakers were originally sold to a company that makes computers to sell with the computers.	St
1.2.3	The mfr eventually ends up with some unsold and sells the entire batch to another reseller.	St
1.2.4	Normally you won't get any documentation, [the original mfr didn't need it] and no fancy box.	St
1.2.5	A few different scenarios, but similar.	St
1.3.1	It can mean refurbished items such as hard drives that are sent back to the manufacturer.	St
1.3.2	They are repaired and resold to jobbers as whitebox or white labled.	St
