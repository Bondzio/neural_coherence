1.1.1	Hi all I facing an irritating problem for the last few days....	St
1.1.2	I m using my office network, the printer is installed on a desktop, all my colleagues can acces it, but when I try I can't.	St
1.1.3	I can even ping the computer but can not access the shared resources on it.... a message appears when i try to access the IP &quot; No network provider can accept the given path&quot; I m unable to access even my own PC and the above mentioned message appears.	St
1.1.4	My firewall is off.	St
1.2.1	Let's hope your IT and network guys understand the links from http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;No+network+provider+accepted+the+given+network+path&quot; .	St
1.2.2	It's a slightly different error message (&quot;accepted&quot; in stead of &quot;can accept&quot;), but that might not be a problem.	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	Since this is an office environment your first step would be to see what your IT Department has to say.	St
1.3.2	If they experience difficulty, then may be the article below will help; http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=841570 I wasn't sure I understood your last sentence, you are &quot;unable to access even my own PC and the above mentioned message appears&quot;.	St
1.3.3	Access your computer from where?	St
1.3.4	Mark	St
1.4.1	Ideally when u access your computer by putting ur own IP in RUN, then it shows ur shared folders and printers etc.	St
1.4.2	but in my case when i put my own IP it returns the same message as in the case of another computers.	St
1.4.3	i hope u understand what i mean.	St
