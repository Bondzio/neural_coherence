1.5.3	I do n't see much detail about the host machine .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St

1.8.6	Under my Computer both a CD drive and DVD drive are listed Sorry , but I 'm not that conversant about these things .	St
1.8.7	Maybe I 'll have to take the thing back where I bought it and ask them to check it out .	St
1.8.8	Thanks	Polite
1.9.1	- Device Manager is under a button in the Hardware tab of the ( right-click ) properties of My Computer ( on your desktop ) .	St
1.9.2	- The BIOS setup is under the F2 or F10 or the delete-key ( or a rich choice of other keys , totally depends on the maker of your PC or motherboard ) right at the start of the booting .	St
1.9.3	Look for a message like & quot ; Press del to enter Setup & quot ; or study the manual .	St
1.9.4	If the drives are listed in My Computer ( Windows Explorer ) and you still ca n't burn using a burning program , there are 2 possibilities : 1 .	St
1.9.5	A problem with the driver .	St
1.9.6	You can see that in Device Manager ( which is the way to manage your devices ) .	St
1.9.7	2 .	St
1.9.8	A broken burner .	St
1.9.9	Needs to be replaced .	St
1.9.10	Any computer shop can fix this .	St
1.9.11	Kees	St
1.10.1	Sorry , I was opening up My Computer and then clicking on properties but now I have found it ( long time since I was into it and totally forgot how to find it as well as the BIOS ) Thanks .	St
1.10.2	Under the hardware tab I found the following : HL-DT-ST CD-ROM GCR-8480B and HL-DT-ST DVDRRW GSA-2166D USB DEVICE Is this what you were referring to ?	Ques
1.10.3	When I click on them both say they are working properly .	St
1.10.4	I was wondering if I unplug it and plug it back in if that would help ?	Ques
1.10.5	I have a hunch I will have to take it in .	St
1.10.6	I presume then the computer will also have to go .	St
1.10.7	Thanks Helen	St
1.11.1	Well I took the burner in and they tested it and found it worked fine and that it had to be my computer .	St
1.11.2	I tried to get into the BIOS but could n't .	St
1.11.3	It says to click on F12 which I did and when it opens I get a page about booting and after a few minutes it starts the computer .	St
1.11.4	What I do n't understand is that sometimes I get a notice that it is working fine but another program tells me I do n't have one and borth Nero and starburn tell me to insert a disk when one is there already .	St
1.11.5	I suppose this means I will have to take the computer in	St
