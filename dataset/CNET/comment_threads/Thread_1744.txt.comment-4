According to NVidia's website; the 9800 GT requires at least 105 watts of power (Minimum Recommended System Power 400 watts), as well as (2) 6 pin power connectors.
The Phenom II x4 955 BE requires 125 watts of power...so if your current PSU is 450 watts, with no 6 pin GPU connectors, I'd have to say that you're SOL for the PSU.
http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9800gt_us.html (see thermal and power specs) I would have to concur with posters from the other forum; your current motherboard only supports AMD Phenom CPU's up to (and including) the 9600 Agena series, and is limited to 65 watts max.
