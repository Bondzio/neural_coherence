Hello CNET Members, I am thinking of upgrading my HDD but I'm not sure what to do.
You see, If I get a HDD upgrade, won't I lose all my current data?
I would'nt mind getting a External HDD but I feel it would take up too much space.
I only have a tiny table on this desk.
All suggestions appreciated.
