to get into the bios, you have to do it before the windows startup screen.
it is the screen that you see where it says 'press [a key] to enter cmos, or bios'.
this (key) is probably [delete], [f1], or whatever else it says.
after you press the correct key, you should be taken to a blue or gray screen.
just look through there (don't tamper with anything that you don't know what it is) and find something to the effect of a 'timer'.
when you find the timer just disable it.
(oh, and the bios is controlled with the keyboard, there is no mouse.
and be sure when you find and disable the timer, save the settings.
to save it, it is usually the [f10] key, if not, it should say how at the bottom of the bios screen)
