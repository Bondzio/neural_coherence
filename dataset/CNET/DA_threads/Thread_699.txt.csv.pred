1.1.1	Any ideas why I can not get DBAN to boot up , and erase my hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have tried it with CD and USB .	St
1.1.3	My system recovery discs boot in the same drive .	St
1.1.4	I reboot with the DBAN disc in the same drive ; and it goes right into Windows .	St
1.1.5	I have tried every Bios boot order available , and tried a USB flash .	St
1.1.6	Made CD ROM my primary boot drive .	St
1.1.7	Made the hard drive with flash , primary boot .	St
1.1.8	Seems if system discs will boot , I am booting the drive ok ?	Ques
1.1.9	Am I missing something .	St
1.1.10	It is not a perfect set-up because I am using the DVD Rom to boot , in place of a dead CD drive .	St
1.1.11	Even if this were the problem it seems I could boot with USB ?	Ques
1.1.12	I downloaded DBAN direct from the C-net sight direct to drive , and tried next older version from the DBAN sight .	St
1.1.13	Still boot right past into Windows , every time .	St
1.1.14	My system is about 10 years old , so I was considering something to do with the version of DBAN , or something on my computer it needs to run ?	Ques
1.1.15	Does not seem like it .	St
1.1.16	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.17	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Rather than creating the CD from the .ISO .	St
1.2.2	This difference looks subtle but matters .	St
1.2.3	Tell the forum what you used to create this bootable CD .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hpe you got the .ISO file and then used a proper burner like IMGBURN ( free ) and then in its setting used & quot ; make bootable & quot ; or similar .	St
1.3.2	I also use CDburnerXP ( free ) and again use the .ISO file gotten , burn it .	St
1.3.3	Make the CD drive the 1st boot device and it should work .	St
1.3.4	You ca n't copy files to a blank CD or anything like that , it just wo n't work .	St
1.3.5	Try this again , using the s/w I suggested it should work .	St
1.3.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Had to look up .ISO .	St
1.4.2	Is that similar to a Zip file ?	Ques
1.4.3	Yes I do have the ISO file only , on the boot disk I am trying to use .	St
1.4.4	Problem identified there .	St
1.4.5	I did however , just this last time , get the USB version of DBAN ; and opened that one up over top of itself on the flash ; and ended up with 11 separate files .	St
1.4.6	This did not work as a boot device either .	St
1.4.7	many of my attempts were directly with the ISO file I presume , aside this last one .	St
1.4.8	I only have the ISO file as you mention , on the primary CD , I have been trying to use .	St
1.4.9	Which means , I am not the only one , yippee I did try opening it on the old target machine only ; but it is bare bones , and wanted to go hunting on the internet for something to open it .	St
1.4.10	I did not want a disk killer loose on my main machine ; or I might have figured something out .	St
1.4.11	I guess I am using Firefox , to download into the downloads folder , or directly to the CD/USB .	St
1.4.12	What form , and what tools do I need here ?	Ques
1.4.13	I did not notice any download instructions , perhaps I missed them : ) Do I need to open the ISO file after the download ?	Ques
1.4.14	What do I open it with ?	Ques
1.4.15	Then what ?	Ques
1.4.16	I am sure this is the problem .	St
1.4.17	I can live with 2 wasted days .	St
1.4.18	Set me straight.please : ) Thank you moderator !	St
1.4.19	I think you nailed it	St
1.5.1	CyberLink DVD suite , seemed to come up as an option , and it burns .	St
1.5.2	I am preparing the boot disc on my main computer , which is not obsolete .	St
1.5.3	I also have HP Media Smart , Windows DVD maker also .	St
1.5.4	Windows 7 has a burn feature .	St
1.5.5	Will any of those work ?	Ques
1.5.6	This process , is certainly not my normal operation ; do n't do much formatting , extracting , or disk killing for that matter .	St
1.5.7	Is this complicated , to keep people from erasing the hard drive by accident ?	Ques
1.5.8	Seems a complicated way to do it ; or is it just the nature of creating a bootable file , and distributing it .	St
1.5.9	Maybe because it is free ?	Ques
1.5.10	Are there any instructions anywhere for this ?	Ques
1.5.11	Seems like the days before Windows you just had a simple Dos command like C : Format , and you were good to go .	St
1.5.12	No such luck these days I guess ?	Ques
1.5.13	Glad I am not doing this for a living , I would go broke for sure .	St
1.5.14	If I have to spend another day learning how to boot mode a burn ; I may have the whole week done here .	St
1.5.15	Crazy .	St
1.5.16	I know ya do n't make the rules , tell me what ya can .	St
1.5.17	Will anything I have work , or do I need to learn another program like IMGBURN ?	Ques
1.5.18	Thanks Willy !	St
1.6.1	The programme is easy to use just put a disc in and browse to your iso file and hit burn .	St
1.6.2	Dafydd .	St
1.7.1	How about the USB version of DBAN ?	Ques
1.7.2	Why did n't that work ?	Ques
1.7.3	Not sure what I used to open or extract the ISO , perhaps that is the problem there .	St
1.7.4	Does that need some kind of software , to put the ISO image , into a useable format as well ?	Ques
1.7.5	I will give IMAGBURN a shot tomorrow , burn another CD , and try again .	St
1.7.6	Thanks a lot !	St
1.7.7	I needed the help , more complicated than I thought , as simple as it might be .	St
1.7.8	KILDISK needed to make a bootable disc as well , obviously , for the system drive to erase ; but the software would only make it in DOS mode , which did not seem to boot anything either .	St
1.7.9	The Free version says it will kill the system drive ; but I could not get that to work.. Looks like Kildisk was a more familiar EXE .	St
1.7.10	file anyway .	St
1.7.11	I guess it burns the bootdisk for you , but not for Windows .	St
1.7.12	I must have done something wrong there as well .	St
1.8.1	This software will burn it for you .	St
1.8.2	You do n't need to extract the iso just make sure you tick burn iso find your file and click burn .	St
1.8.3	Dafydd	St
1.9.1	Try this guide .	St
1.9.2	http : //neosmart.net/wiki/display/G/Burning+ISO+Images+with+ImgBurn Dafydd .	St
1.10.1	By default , you have Cyberlink will pop-up , however you can decline that and select what pgm .	St
1.10.2	will do the burning .	Sug
1.10.3	You 'll find IMGBURN far easier to work and it should by its own merit make a bootable disc from the .ISO file .	St
1.10.4	If you get Imgburn and install it , click on it and then find the .ISO file to burn , that 's all there is to it .	St
1.10.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.11.1	I figured with the Malware I would at least get the program to work here .	St
1.11.2	Do you have to allow the Ask Jeves bar to load onto your machine also ; or am I not doing something right .	St
1.11.3	I got IMGBURN downloaded from C-NET fine , allowed even the coupon trojan , against better judgement .	St
1.11.4	Then chose my USB burner , because my other burner has a raid controller I thought might complicate things .	St
1.11.5	Checked all the settings on the main page ( alll looked good ) was copying a bootable image to disc .	St
1.11.6	It started filling the buffer , said it was writing a lead in or such , and an hour later was still stuck at 12 % no movement on anything .	St
1.11.7	It got hasty and told me to be patient , when I tried to shut it down ( showed it got the shut down message in the log ) and sat there for 10 more minutes .	St
1.11.8	Locked up my fresh clean machine , and I had to manual force the boot of my computer .	St
1.11.9	I will see if I can do a fresh install , but could do without the trojan .	St
1.11.10	Perhaps I missed something .	St
1.11.11	Any thoughts , I seem to be getting two problems for every one I do n't fix .	St
1.11.12	I did not seem to have much trouble with the screens or navigation of IMGBURN ; it just did not burn the image for me .	St
1.11.13	I even shut everything down while it burned , scanners and such .	St
1.11.14	Maybe the install did not take .	St
1.11.15	I hope it will uninstall easy .	St
1.11.16	I did a fresh download , of the latest version of DBAN used IMGBURN main screen , chose copy image to disc ( first one ) then chose the program at the top left using the little icon .	St
1.11.17	DBAN showed up as the image to copy , showed as a bootable ISO image ; everything looked good , then off we went to lock up mode .	St
1.11.18	Something is just strange here ; it ca n't be this hard to erase a hard drive on an old machine .	St
1.11.19	Should take minutes not days .	St
1.11.20	What next Willy , any ideas ?	Ques
1.11.21	Sbybot would not update , which is very odd .	St
1.11.22	Ran without finding any Malware .	St
1.11.23	Have not run the rest of the scanners .	St
1.12.1	Well , it does seem you have other issues going on .	St
1.12.2	Since , I 'm not there you have to describe as best as possible .	St
1.12.3	You mentioned , & quot ; malware & quot ; well any form of that is n't going to be good .	St
1.12.4	If that was already a problem prior to anything you stated before , that could be a reason for not being able to boot the CD , maybe .	St
1.12.5	If now its a problem , because you got new s/w and & quot ; you & quot ; let in , then you have complicated issues and/or all the more to clear out .	St
1.12.6	If you ca n't update your protection schemes so they have the latest defense and run anyways , it may not report finding anything because it does n't know about the latest threats .	St
1.12.7	All in all , it gets difficult .	St
1.12.8	CAN you at least burn the s/w on another PC , a friend 's or school , etc . ?	Ques
1.12.9	FYI- I do n't install *any* browser toolbars , any !	St
1.12.10	It becomes too easy for issue/problems to arise , so I decline them .	St
1.12.11	Even , if you do n't use a browser at any given time , allowing the toolbars may have allowed other unwanted or pests to enter your system .	St
1.12.12	Even if not nasty , they hog resources , etc. , they become a load which at times makes operations take longer or appear to hang/freeze .	St
1.12.13	So & quot ; Ask Jeeves & quot ; , i would decline , and there better be an & quot ; uncheck box & quot ; in order to continue the install .	St
1.12.14	If not , STOP and delete that pgm .	St
1.12.15	I would n't trust it .	St
1.12.16	So , its important to trust sources of pgms or apps to install .	St
1.12.17	I suggest you check out these websites : http : //www.majorgeeks.com http : //www.jumbo.com http : //www.tucows.com http : //www.sourceforge.net http : //filehippo.com Even , if any of the above seem to give notice of problems , STOP and exit and delete that recent gotten pgm.. Notice , I did n't mention CNET downloads , I find it with all the problems you have now , just get from another source .	Sug
1.12.18	Alas , you need n't open the .ISO file , you direct your burning s/w to it and select it and then burn , which IMGBURN does quite well .	St
1.12.19	BTW , I re-read your 1st post , WHY is the dead CD drive still attached , remove or disconnect entirely .	St
1.12.20	make sure the DVD drive is 1st on cable or primary drive .	Sug
1.12.21	That may cause a slow response to burn .	St
1.12.22	On top of all this , you never supplied details of your PC brand or type .	St
1.12.23	10yr .	St
1.12.24	PC , it is very probable that the PC does n't allow USB boot-up , but for now I can'rt asset that .	St
1.12.25	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.13.1	Sound advice from Willy .	St
1.13.2	In the nine previous posts I see no mention of malware .	St
1.13.3	Do you know what this malware is and where it came from ?	Ques
1.13.4	It 's time to deal with this before you go on to installing DBaN .	St
1.13.5	Please post more details as Willy said to narrow things down .	St
1.13.6	Dafydd .	St
1.14.1	That 's a senseless advice , since DBAN is n't installed .	St
1.14.2	It does n't even notice there is malware on the disk .	St
1.14.3	All it does ( when you run it from a bootable disk ) is erase the drive .	St
1.14.4	And - if as the OP seems to have - there is a problem to burn that .iso file to a disk , it can be done on any other PC .	St
1.14.5	Kees	St
1.15.1	So you are saying Kees that malware could n't stop a properly burnt live DBAN disc from installing ?	Ques
1.15.2	Dafydd .	St
1.16.1	I meant running not installing .	St
1.16.2	Dafydd .	St
1.17.1	I said that DBAN is n't installed in Windows at all .	St
1.17.2	It 's already installed on the disk and runs from there .	St
1.17.3	Kees	St
1.18.1	NIL	St
1.19.1	So the problem is the OP has n't got a live disc to run on his machine ?	Ques
1.19.2	Dafydd .	St
1.20.1	I read that he could n't burn the disk .	St
1.20.2	That 's why I noticed it can be burned on any other PC .	St
1.20.3	Kees	St
1.21.1	Right I 'm with you now Kees , he needs to use a different computer .	St
1.21.2	Very confusing post is n't it .	St
1.21.3	Dafydd .	St
1.22.1	Until now .	St
1.22.2	I identified most of the Malware that came down with IMAGEBURN .	St
1.22.3	Removed it best I could .	St
1.22.4	The two main items were the MIXIDJ trojan Jacker ; which by the way I unchecked from the instal box .	St
1.22.5	100 PERCENT SURE .	St
1.22.6	It loaded anyway .	St
1.22.7	The Iminet program that instals emoticons removed after a restart , using Win add/remove .	St
1.22.8	No mention of that I saw , unless buried deep in the legal clause .	St
1.22.9	Price Gong , may be the coupon related spyware they do warn about ( Required for download ) Defender got that .	St
1.22.10	I broke some rules , to get the free-ware .	St
1.22.11	letting my primary virus protection down .	St
1.22.12	I just did not expect such a hit .	St
1.22.13	I was jacked , redirected , got crap-wear , toolbar , and spyware .	St
1.22.14	Who knows what else .	St
1.22.15	I removed the IMAGBURN as well ; and virus protection picked up on it as malware from the place it was deleted to ; and quaranteened it .	St
1.22.16	It was all pretty aggressive ; though moderate difficulty removing .	St
1.22.17	Took some time .	St
1.22.18	Hope it did not screw anything up in my registry , or system files .	St
1.22.19	Will run all my scanners again soon .	St
1.22.20	The Malware came from the C-NET Download page for IMAGEBURN .	St
1.22.21	If you type IMAGBURN DOWNLOAD into your search engine ; about 2-3 items down , is the cnet download page .	St
1.22.22	Cnet banner and familiar headings .	St
1.22.23	There are warnings by others I read , I just did not take them as serious as I should have .	St
1.22.24	Trusted the Cnet link .	St
1.22.25	I guess I felt lucky , figured the sight I got tech from ; would be more secure .	St
1.22.26	At worst I figured it would be an easy to remove add-on , or program ; got a bit more .	St
1.22.27	Total crap-ware package for sure .	St
1.22.28	MixiDj I think , listed as moderate threat .	St
1.22.29	Been a long time since I downloaded anything I was aware of ; must have known I had a clean factory recovered machine laying in wait .	St
1.23.1	The DBAN bootdisc is not going to run on my download machine , used here and getting malware on it .	St
1.23.2	Once the dban bootdisc is created , it will run on the old target machine , to wipe that drive .	St
1.23.3	I have to get a good image burned first , because the USB method I tried on old machine , is likely not bootable on the target machine as Willy said .	St
1.23.4	I suppose malware could interfere with creating the boot image disc .	St
1.23.5	It already did , since the IMAGBURN went bust twice and caused a manual reboot of my download computer .	St
1.23.6	The old target computer is not even on-line .	St
1.23.7	I am preparing the boot-disc with my current computer that replaced the old one , about 2.5 years ago .	St
1.23.8	Then use the created bootdisk to wipe the old drive , so I can use it someplace else .	St
1.23.9	Sorry for any confusion .	St
1.23.10	Probably my fault , once I have been at this a while .	St
1.24.1	Oh dear you have been a naughty boy !	St
1.24.2	Where did you download imgburn from .	St
1.24.3	It should have been http : //www.imgburn.com/ I 've checked the site and its clean .	St
1.24.4	Back to basics , in your last post you almost made the cd from the iso you mit want to try it on another computer .	St
1.24.5	Dafydd .	St
1.25.1	Not yet .	Res
1.25.2	There are a few tangents with the old machine complicating things .	St
1.25.3	First tangent , the OP has never erased a hard drive before , yet owned a computer since the DOS days .	St
1.25.4	Imagine that .	St
1.25.5	Second tangent , is an old computer with some limitations .	St
1.25.6	I just want to erase the drive ; but it got more fun .	St
1.25.7	Since a computer is a cascade of sequences ; one problem creates 2 more .	St
1.25.8	Read above , I think you will all follow better .	St
1.26.1	Just read your prior post .	Polite
1.26.2	Yes that 's the way to go , use the link I gave in previous post to download the iso .	St
1.26.3	Dafydd .	St
1.27.1	Should have been download imgburn Dafydd .	St
1.28.1	http : //download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html Impulse gots the best of me	St
1.29.1	I checked the cnet link you clicked on and it take you to softwareinformer.com .	St
1.29.2	Having researched that site it seems dodgy .	St
1.29.3	The link I gave is the direct download for imgburn .	St
1.29.4	I have downloaded from ther with no problems .	St
1.29.5	Dafydd .	St
1.30.1	Good news , I am now running DBAN on the target computer , and erasing the target hard-drive .	St
1.30.2	Yippee !	St
1.30.3	Major geeks sight triggered something , that antivirus picked up .	St
1.30.4	FileHippo got it done clean .	St
1.30.5	Man am I snakebitten here ; I have got a bad external DVD burner just showing up on my download machine ; unless the CD 's are just too old .	St
1.30.6	I do n't burn many CD 's mostly DVD 's ... . but have been using this drive all along the last month and a half .	St
1.30.7	Loading and reloading all the system disks , new drivers , and all the software back on my good computer .	St
1.30.8	Guess I wore it out .	St
1.30.9	It just decided to go .	St
1.30.10	On top of that , I got a real screwed up CD out of my stack here ; which is scratched all around the center beyond where it seems the spindle would reach .	St
1.30.11	Just the last attempt , no big deal diagnosing this .	St
1.30.12	I am deffinately blind missing that cut up disc .	St
1.30.13	I am not making sense of that .	St
1.30.14	I would never put that back in the stack , and never had a drive go bad to cause it ; so it must be bad from the 100 pack it came from a long time ago ; or my failing external burner on the download machine did it .	St
1.30.15	Not likely , did n't hear anything .	St
1.30.16	I guess I will find out when I open the burner up to see .	St
1.30.17	I am sure it needs a good cleaning anyway .	St
1.30.18	It is not like I have a bunch old junk here on the new machine ; but I do operate in a strange environment , harsh to the hardware .	St
1.30.19	Nothing I can do about it though .	St
1.30.20	Thanks for all the help an patience .	St
1.30.21	Keeping my fingers crossed .	St
1.30.22	Will post back when the drive is erased ; and get back to the DVR phase ( Willy )	St
1.31.1	Run DBAN from a flash drive = ) Usually works when CD does n't !	St
1.31.2	Enjoy	St
1.32.1	I probably need to read the CNET mission statement , or profile .	St
1.32.2	Are you saying these download pages , are randomly created by users who post them ; or the sight page was maliciously redirected ?	Ques
1.32.3	I guess I was thinking some form of staff , or moderator generated these download links .	St
1.32.4	I presume they must be user generated , by your response .	St
1.32.5	There must be a simple was to save and generate a shared download link then , by users ?	Ques
1.32.6	Using a default CNET page generation .	St
1.32.7	No Genie behind a desk .	St
1.33.1	Pretty sure the flash is not bootable .	St
1.33.2	I did try that towards the end .	St
1.33.3	It would not boot from flash .	St
1.33.4	I got that download from a CNET link as well ; so not sure ; but it seemed to download ok. Just would not boot the machine no matter what boot sequence I tried .	St
1.33.5	USB is not listed by itself under Bios ( only in the sub menu for teh hard drive ) and it would not change position in the boot sequence .	St
1.33.6	Old computer .	St
1.34.1	Nothing malicious , my point was it 's always better to download directly rather than using a mirror site .	St
1.34.2	On the Cnet download page under the big download button there is an option to do this .	St
1.34.3	How is the disc erasure going ?	Ques
1.34.4	Dafydd .	St
1.35.1	About seven hours on my slow DVDROM , and machine , hard drive seems to be erased ? .	St
1.35.2	Since my target computer had only a DVDROM , running the DBAN boot disc ; I was not able to figure a way to get any log .	St
1.35.3	Half way through , it sped up , and there were no errors .	St
1.35.4	But I guess maybe some errors were found while erasing over night ?	Ques
1.35.5	Or Not ?	Ques
1.35.6	The screen showing after the nuke , said the following : DBAN FINISHED WITH NON-FATAL ERRORS ... ..THEN SAYS TO CHECK THE LOG ... ... ... .THEN THE START AND RUN TIMES ... ... THEN * Fail ATA Disk WDC 320AAJB-0 00.0 298GB WD-WCARW6607672 Then in bold red letters it says KILLED ( as the last line showing ) .	St
1.35.7	Reboot of the computer , could not find operating system .	St
1.35.8	DO I HAVE A NUKED DRIVE , READY FOR FORMATING AND USE-OR DO I STILL HAVE PROBLEMS ?	Ques
1.35.9	I am getting a convertor cable to allow me to plug the drive into my USB , on the good working computer ; then I can perhaps run a check DISK , look for any bad sectors , or format the drive .	St
1.35.10	Should I do this ?	Ques
1.35.11	Do I need to ?	Ques
1.35.12	Before I start the next step ; getting my DVR to recognize the nuked drive , formatting , and cloning .	St
1.35.13	Probably should start a new thread for that , I guess .	Sug
1.36.1	A sense of humor lightens up any cursing , and rage : ) I found this humorous , no ill will .	St
