<s> hey bob, yeah i have got it down to the CPU/HSF, Power Supply Unit(PSU), motherboard and the speaker, but still no beep from the speaker. </s>
<s> dont know what to do next. </s>
<s> thanks for the help. </s>

<s> At this point, the possible bad parts in order of cost are: 1. </s>
<s> Speaker. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> PSU. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Motherboard. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> CPU/HSF. </s>
<s> There is a simple part on the motherboard that should be checked with a voltmeter and that is the BIOS battery. </s>
<s> If it's the usual CR2032, then anything below 2.8 or so Volts means you get another. </s>
<s> At this point you've scoured the board for the jumpers that you've checked are all in the right places. </s>
<s> I always make sure the speaker is a good one. </s>
<s> But my next move is CARDBOARD. </s>
<s> Remove the motherboard from the case since some builders may install too many METAL STANDOFFS and short out the backside of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Place the four parts on the cardboard and set it up. </s>
<s> Flip the AC on and use a spare jumper to power up the affair. </s>
<s> No BEEPS? </s>
<s> IF you have a Voltmeter, you can see if the PSU has the correct voltage on each pin. </s>
<s> If not, another PSU is obtained (always oversize the Watts!) </s>
<s> and the test repeated. </s>
<s> Then the motherboard and then the CPU/HSF. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> hey again, i tried the cardboard and everything. </s>
<s> nothing is working. </s>
<s> i think i am just going to have to buy a new combo. </s>
<s> i will tell you this, however, when i first took the heatsink off, the cpu was practically glued to the back of the heatsink. </s>
<s> in other words, i didnt have to undo the latch to take the cpu out, it came out when the cpu came off. </s>
<s> do you think this could have done something to the cpu or the &quot;cpu holder&quot; on the mother board? </s>
<s> is there anyway to test the cpu to see if it is still ok? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> There are no tests in the field except for swap and retest. </s>
<s> If you don't have spare parts... </s>
<s> Frankly, if the CPU and HSF came out without unlatching... </s>
<s> But words haven't conveyed what a picture would. </s>
<s> A real problem is that a faulty PSU could have caused this as well as a loose screw (or other conductive item) in the machine. </s>
<s> Sorry, I couldn't tell if it's good/bad without placing into a working machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
