The wireless care detects the routers signal with signal strength around 60%. Both the router and wireless card are Netgear equipment and everything thing suggests that the connection should work fine but it doesn't. This particular network is open (i.e., it has no security enabled) and the wireless card's wireless assistant indicates there is no problem connecting however the assistant also indicates the assigned IP is nowhere near what it should be. The IP should be 192.168.0.3 however the IP it says was assigned is something like 169.254.0.20. IPCONFIG indicates that same IP. There are no other networks detected by the card and the signal strength is pretty steady. My friend has indicated that the connection worked fine last week. I already tried rebooting the router several times but that had no effect. I am puzzled...is there something wrong with the wireless card or perhaps its driver or is it something else? Oh and the computer is running on Windows ME. Anyone have any helpful advice. Thanks

Open winipcfg from Start/Run and try releasing then renewing the IP for the network card in question. The underlying issue may be spyware/viral in nature. If so try Safe Mode with Networking and run the usual online scanners to clean off the machine.

(this was over a wireless network card). i tried the same thing on the internal network card and it gave me an IP of 0.0.0.0 and would not renew the IP for the same reason as stated above. i think she has big problems...any advice?

You could try re-installing the TCP/IP Protocol, and Microsoft Client, but that's not going to help if you have spyware or a virus. You could download Stinger: http://vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/ and it fits on a floppy, since you don't seem to be able to get to the Internet. Does the computer have any Antivirus software running? Are the signatures current? Any Antispyware software?

Good luck.
