1.1.1	Hey everybody, i just joined Cnet, so forgive me if this topic has already been discussed!	St
1.1.2	I recently purchased the Samsung SyncMaster 910 MP.	St
1.1.3	It is a LCD-TV monitor with 1280x1024 resolution (It doesn't have HD compatibility built-in though).	St
1.1.4	It has a built in TV tuner and A/V inputs, and it works great except for the quality of the TV and Video game image.	St
1.1.5	I know that I can't expect a real great picture when it comes to the TV because i don't recieve a HD signal, and the monitot/tv isn't HD ready anyway.	St
1.1.6	However, i play a lot of Xbox games and the quality of the image is really quite bad.	St
1.1.7	I purchased a HD component cable pack for the Xbox, but i do not have any place to plug in the red/green/blue cables into the monitor.	St
1.1.8	So my question is this: Is there any external device i can buy to make this monitor/tv accept HD cables, or am i just stuck with a mediocore video game image?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance for all the help!	St
1.2.1	You have 2 choices: 1)return the HD cable and stick with your bad quality image.	St
1.2.2	OR I think you could, not sure if it will work though 2)Spend some money, buy a video card that accepts HD component input, and then connect component to the video card, then connect the Tv(monitor) to the computer with a normal pc monitor cable, do some research, find some software and hardware that will allow you to do that, and you will be fine.	St
1.2.3	But in your case, the quality really depends on your TV, not the cables, because as far as i know, XBOX produces the same frequency between HD output and normal A/V output, in other words, same quality, because both cables supports 720p, if the back of your xbox game says 720p, then the xbox will produce 720p regardless it is HD or A/V, because A/V is capable of producing 720p also, unless your game says 1080i, because A/V cables are not capable of transfering 1080i frequency, other wise, the quality in both the a/v and the hd cable will be the same.	St
1.2.4	I think what really matters is that your tv supports the frequency of your games, if it doesn't, either you might break the tv, or it will just not produce the quality it was supposed to, so i would just return the HD cable, because unless your game is capable of producing HD frequency, like 1080i, which also requires an HD Tv, it will be the same in both cables.	St
1.2.5	Good luck P.S.	Polite
1.2.6	no matter what you do, you will need a HD TV to be able to get HD quality, because only a HD Tv will be able to decode the HD signal in to video form, so even if you convert the plug so how, the signal will be still be in HD form, also, there is no way of converting it because HD has 3 video cables, and a/v only has 1, unless you do it through the 2nd way i mentioned above(if it is possible to be done).
