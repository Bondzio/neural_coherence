don't use the wireless side of the laptop to configure the router.
it would be better to configure the router using your desktop.
the reason for this is that when you change any setting the wireless connection is going to be lost for a time and your laptop needs to reconnect.
your wired desktop will be less affected than the wireless laptop during this process.
