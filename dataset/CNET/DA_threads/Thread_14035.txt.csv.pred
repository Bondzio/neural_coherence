1.1.1	So I 've been going around the internet for a couple hours now trying to find some decent ram that 's compatible with my motherboard ( ASUS M4A77TD ) What I 'm looking for is something along the lines of 8-12gb 1600MHz DDR3 $ 60- $ 80 I have 4 slots available to use .	St
1.1.2	I just picked up 12gb of Corsair Vengeance ram only to find out that it wo n't work with what I have .	St
1.1.3	The other problem is that I 've found a few items that do work with my ASUS but are all out of stock at Tigerdirect , Newegg , etc .	St
1.2.1	strange value .	St
1.2.2	How did you arrive at that ?	Ques
1.2.3	It seems all the ddr3 memory stick comes in 2/4gb each ... and the board have 4 sockets .	St
1.2.4	Did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use .	St
1.2.5	The prices are so reasonable , I probably would not want to mix them .	St
1.2.6	Take a look at Mwave or Fry 's .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=M4A77TD & amp ; Cat=RAM Pick one .	St
1.4.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.4.2	I 'm guessing this is decent ram at the least .	St
1.4.3	Ahtoi- The stock ram was 2 2gb sticks while the Corsair was 3 4gb sticks .	St
