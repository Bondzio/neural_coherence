<s> Ever since I've added in another 512ram to my comp to get it up to 1gb, my comp begin to load applications and games slower. </s>
<s> Even when I have winamp and mozilla firefox running at the same time, my comp would lag intensely; as before i added the ram, this woulnd't happen. </s>
<s> Anyone know why? </s>
<s> Or could it be something else other than the ram? </s>
<s> My comp specs: -Asus a7v8x-x motherboard -AMD Athlon 2600 processor -1GB Ram -ATI X1600 512MB vid card -Western Digit 120gb HD </s>
<s> matched to the motherboard. </s>
<s> It must be the same speed. </s>
<s> My daughter's PC had the same MB....it developed BAD CAPS...not saying that's what wrong with yours or causing the slowdown but do take a close look for bulging and or leaking capacitors surrounding the CPU socket. </s>
<s> Let us know what you find. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I checked for the capacitors in my MB and they seem fine. </s>
<s> Could missing/changed registry on my windows cause this? </s>
<s> since i've been having quite some spyware and trojans hits? </s>
<s> You think repairing my windows would help? </s>
<s> &quot;Quite some spyware and trojans&quot; would make me want to backup all important files to other media and wipe the HD. </s>
<s> Then, you get to reinstall XP, all the proper drivers, and everything else...except Limewire and other P2P file sharing programs. </s>
