I was wondering what accessories you all recommended for the Macbook.
I already have a small list, but wondered what you all thought.
So heres my list 1)Samsung 206BW digital/analog wide screen monitor 20in 2)Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Mouse for Notebooks 3)Targus mobile Power Inventer car charger 4)Brenthaven Fusion Messenger Bag 5) Apple iWork 6) Apple .Mac account 7)Klipsch Promedia 2.1 THX certified Computer 3 piece speaker system If anyone else has any suggestions or comments please feel free 2 post.
This is all going to go with the Black MacBook, with is cool seeing the monitor, speakers, bag, and mouse are all black.
My price range is about $2500 or less.
