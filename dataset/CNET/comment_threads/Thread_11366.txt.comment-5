thanks guys, of course, neither of those look very impressive, one advantage should be weight, and 3 pounds doesn't really cut it.
I think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/we-want-a-dead-simple-web-tablet-help-us-build-it/comment-page-10/ 2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof.
without a keyboard, it would be easy.
then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again!
