I have a Dell Dimension 2350 desktop with windows XP operating system.
Just lately when I shut the machine down completely at night I get &quot;Program not responding&quot;.
That seems to only happen at night afer the unit has been on all day.
If I shut everything down after its only been on for a few hours it works just fine.
Sound familiar...and what should I do??
Many thanks Mil
