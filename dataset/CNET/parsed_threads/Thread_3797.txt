<s> I've build a new system using the following componets: Asus A7N8X deluxe Nforce 2 board AMD 2500+ cpu 512mb Geil PC3500 memory 120GB HDD ATI based 9800 video card cd-rom, cd-rw I've only installed XP Pro(no service packs yet), the NForce drivers for the board, video drivers. </s>
<s> I had used an old ps/2 scroll mouse to do the set up, now while attempting to use any optical mouse, they don't work. </s>
<s> Am pluging into the ps/2 mouse port on the board with a MS Trackball Optical and a MS wheelmouse Opital, both show the curser on screen but do not operate. </s>
<s> When pluged in the trackball does light up, the wheelmouse doesn't, it could be defective. </s>
<s> The optical wheelmouse is brand new, per instructions, in stalled the software first, shut down, pluged the wheelmouse in, rebooted; curser shows up, doesn't move. </s>
<s> Greatly appreciate any suggestion on fixing this problem. </s>
<s> an email to me earlier about this, you resolved the problem by realizing you had USB option for the mouse and after removing the adapter for ps/2 and booting up, it now works. </s>
<s> Good job. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> check your bios to make sure you have USB enabled for the mouse so it will work in all situations....not just normal desktop. </s>
<s> It should already default to it, if I remember correctly, but I would check anyhow just to make sure. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> I'm still trying to figure out why. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
