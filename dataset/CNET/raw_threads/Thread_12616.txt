Now, my keyboard and mouse do not have a problem. They work just fine. The only other time my motherboard ever spoke to me was when I installed RAM that wasn't compatible. Then it said: &quot;Your memory may have a problem.&quot; Except, last time there WAS a problem- the memory didn't work. This time there ISN'T a problem- I&quot;m using the keyboard and mouse now with no issue. Any idea how to make that thing stop talking?

I suspect the msg your getting is because the bios probe is finding something it does not like about the mouse and keyboard. Did this ever work? If so what has changed?

Usually within the 1st page, there's a setting for error procedure, if kybd. does it stop, etc. Hit F1 to continue. As for the voice, again there's some setting to disable &quot;voice&quot; though it should report an error via some text message. It should be explained in your mtrbd. or system manual. If none, goto the support website and get one for your model# mtrbd./system and download it for reference. tada -----Willy

You didn't have it before and really its of no real benefit for many. Like the seat belt buzzer when not connected, drove people nuts, now now buzzer in new cars at least a more friendly &quot;ding&quot;. tada -----Willy

Also make sure the kbd and mouse don't have stuck buttons. Unplug them and replug them into the ports and then start your computer. If USB, try different ports.

Maybe someone else (or you) changed the bootup message to the &quot;somethings wrong with the keyboard message&quot; and there really is nothing wrong with your stuff. I changed my bootup message to MC Hammer saying &quot;U can't touch this&quot;. ~BreNt

14332	13	149747	1684533	1684496	VAPCMD	1/19/06 6:52 PM	1.13769672E12	When the PC first starts up....	At startup, just after the PC is turned on, the monitor often displays a message like 'Hit Del or F2 to enter BIOS.Setup If you don't see that message...try it anyway. If neither works check your system or motherboard manual. Let us know.

There is also: &quot;all errors&quot;, &quot;no errors&quot;, &quot;all but, diskette,&quot; &quot;all but diskette and keyboard.&quot; I have no idea what they are halting. Should I choose &quot;all errors&quot;? I also noted that &quot;box genie&quot; is turned on, which is the voice, I suppose, (but who's ever heard of a female genie?) I dont want to turn off the voice, I just want to stop it from reporting an error when there is none. I tried unplugging and replugging the mouse and keyboard, and it didn't help. Anything else I should look for in BIOS?
14332	15	149747	1690943	1690320	VAPCMD	1/22/06 3:05 PM	1.1379423E12	Just change it to HALT ON NO ERRORs	And if the voice bothers you...just turn it off too...the only time I've ever heard is is at bootup and it doesn't affect your sound otherwise. You can always turn it back on if desired. Just keep in mind if you have to troubleshoot the system...you may want to turn these features back on temporarily. Good to hear you found it.
