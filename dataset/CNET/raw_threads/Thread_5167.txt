11467	0	309553	2864548	NR	castlemanor	9/22/08 5:06 PM	1.22210316E12	upgrading a Dell dimension 8200 series desktop	I have a Dell Dimension 8200 series desktop with 512 MB PC800 RDRAM memory, Pentium 4 processor at 2.0 GHz and Windows XP home OS. I have a 64 MB NVIDIA Geforce MX graphics card but I have access to a 256 MB one that I could install instead. I would like to upgrade this for my grandson to use to play &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Would it be worth it to upgrade the memory? What about the processer speed? I wouldn't need a new mother board, would I? And why would you need a new motherboard, anyway? Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Kathy K.

This is getting harder to find, but maybe the best bet to help the system along. Since, you mention you have 512mb installed, more than likely 2x256mb sticks of ram. That leaves to 2 more slots to fill, so another 2x256mb will do. Otherwise, the bad scenario is you have 4x128mb install, meaning 4 sticks of ram, you have to sacrifice at least 1pair to be lost when you install the new ram. I'm not there, so you need to figure what you actually have. Follow the link, but the info/details are provided via the Dell support website. tada -----Willy
