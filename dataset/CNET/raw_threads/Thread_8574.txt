It is an ATI #1027311302(Rage 128 Ultra Video Card, a 16mb AGP (found this searching the part #). While I know this is a very old computer, it is part of a business network of computers that need absolutely no bells or whistles at all. I would like to find a simple video card that will replace the old one - and would like to buy a new one from a reputable seller vs. buying something refurbished from a company I don't know. Cross referencing on the net seems to be difficult - I'm sure due to the age of the card but are there still &quot;simple&quot; video cards available? If so, can you point me in the right direction? Thank you - Carash123

AGP is old and only a select few even make them any more and those are all for desktops. I'm not sure about your specific laptop but the graphics are more than likely atached to the mother board and you would not be able to replace it any way, when you looked up the part number it gave you the specs for an agp gard because they use the same chipset but I doubt that you have an actual agp slot inside. Again this is atrue for 90% of laptops the highend gaming ones do have replaceable cards but there twice as expensive as there desktop counterparts.

Any of these cards should work fine. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814139165 http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=agp+4x+video+card&cid=11369288243160600623&sa=title#p http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=agp+4x+video+card&cid=6554480941484046086&sa=title#p I would suggest either of these also. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161152 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150107 The original card was an ATI so you might want to stick with them because of the drivers, if you do pick the Nvidia card make sure you delete all the old drivers.
