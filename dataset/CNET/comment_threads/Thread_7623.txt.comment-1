First, you must excuse me if my terminology is not accurate.
I purchased a house that is wired with 16 ports.
I have a cable modem that sends the signal to the switch which then feeds the house and a wireless router (I believe it is router first and then switch, but not sure).
I would like to be able to hook up my printer to one of the ports and print remotely (from laptop, wireless) or from a desktop computer that is physically connected to one of these ports.
I'm not even sure where to start and I don't want to have to sift through numerous web pages and terminology I don't understand.
Any assistance is much appreciated.
Thank you
