Im looking for the knowledge of cache system organization on I7 processors.
If anybody can help me I should like to know: The type of organization of the different levels of cache, i.e., if they are associative, direct mapped or N set associative.
The answer in clock cycles of a Cache reading.
I suppose that level 1 will be read in 1 clock cycle.
And what about cache Level 2 and Level 3?
Is the memory interface which generates the Wait State if there is a cache miss on Level 1 or is Level 1 by itself?
Are the different levels of cache inclusive or exclusive?
The policy of writing is Write through or write back?
