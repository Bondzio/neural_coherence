the solution that you posted had nothing to do with d-link.
you have a motherboard/operating system issue that is keeping a d-link product from working.
the issue had nothing to do with your d-link product.
it had to do with your usb port.
that is like complaining to cheveron about there gas pumps when there is an issue with the fuel filling port on you toyota.
i tried googling d-link &quot;device not recognized&quot; and only found 257 entries.
not bad for such a big company.
you would think they would have a lot more considering how many products they must sell in a month.
not to mention that tech support is not free.
it is for you as a customer, but d-link has to pay somebody to talk to you.
you are expecting that d-link should trouble shoot an issue with your motherboard and os?
why?
call microsoft.
call whoever made your motherboard/pc.
