Currently use a Dell 8250 with 512 ram (4x128).
I do a lot of large CorelDraw file printing (example: 100 copies of a 10 meg file).
I also multitask with at least 2 browsers being open, 1 or 2 additional files that I am working on in Draw.
Question is this....
If I increase my ram to 768m (+$250) or 1g (+600), will I gain that much speed with redrawing corel files, internet work, etc (while multitasking)?
Also, does the ram have anything to do with the spooling speed to my HP 1700 printer?
I don't want to spend the $ if I will only see a 10% increase in performance.
Thanks, Flip
