i assume your raptors are attached to sata1 and sata2.
adding 1 or 2 additional sata drives *recommended*: + attach your new sata drive(s) to sata3 and or sata4 (on the board's edge below the pci slots); + enter your bios and go to integrated peripherals; + open sata devices configuration; + set sata3/sata4 raid to disabled; + go back to integrated peripherals; + open ide devices configuration; + ensure sata3/4 are set to enabled; + save and exit the bios; adding 1 or 2 ide/ata drives: + if you have 2 optical (cd/dvd) drives, make sure they are attached to the same cable (you may have to change the jumpers to make one a &quot;slave&quot; or both &quot;cbl sel&quot; if they're on seperate cables); + connect your ide/ata hard drive(s) to an 80conducter cable (usually provided with the drive and/or mobo); + if connecting 2 hard drives, set jumpers for both to &quot;cbl sel&quot;; + connect your hard drive cable to your vacant ide2 port (on the board's edge below the ram slots); + enter your bios and go to integrated peripherals; + open ide devices configuration; + set onchip ide channel1 to enabled; + save and exit the bios; + re-enter the bios and open standard cmos features; + confirm that ide secondary master and secondary slave are set to auto; + save and exit the bios; once this done, you'll need to partition and format your new drive(s) in windows.
for large drives (&gt;32gb) use ntfs or the manufacturer supplied drive setup software.
