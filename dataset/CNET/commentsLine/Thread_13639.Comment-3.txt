you didn't mention the operating system that you are using.
did you uninstall and reinstall the software?
if you are using vista or 7, with the c5180 you may have to upgrade the software from hp's web site.
it may be bad harware (internal printer issue) as bob said but it could also be a software problem related to the printer/os.
check software before you scrap the unit, c5180 was fairly decent.
