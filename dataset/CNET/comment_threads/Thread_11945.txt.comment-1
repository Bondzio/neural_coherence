I have a Samsung Blu-ray dvd player that was advertised to be netflix ready.
Unfortunately, it can only link to ethernet, and my home has a wireless network.
I tried to work around buying another $100 piece of hardware (ethernet bridge) by linking to my Gateway laptop.
Unfortunately, the laptop does not have an ethernet connector--just phone and USB, and the DVD player does not have a USB connector.
There has to be a gizmo that will let me connect up.
I've looked at ethernet-USB connectors and I think they will work, but I thought I'd let you hardware geniuses give me some advice before I spend more money on this setup.
Thanks for any suggestions you have.
