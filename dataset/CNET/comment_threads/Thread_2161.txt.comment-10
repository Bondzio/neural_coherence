Turned out i didn't see BSOD because my computer was set to not show me.
Now i've seen the BSOD i'm convinced my power supply is fine.
The BSOD reports the problem to be one of two things, some times it is a &quot;Page fault in non paged area&quot;, and others it is something to do with &quot;ati3duag.dll&quot;.
Could a driver fix fix this?
Also new, when playing call of duty 2, it sometimes now just closes after a while instead of the whole computer dying.
The PC gives the usual sorry this had to close error, and if i try to play it again, as soon as i start an actual game, it repeats this closing immediatley.
By the way, its a SANSUN 600W.
Thanks very much for helping me try ans solve this, any more ideas?
