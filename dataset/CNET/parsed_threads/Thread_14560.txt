<s> ASUS P4S800D-X http://usa.asus.com/prog/spec.asp?m=P4S800D-X&langs=09 or TYAN S5101AN http://www.tyan.com/products/html/trinityi875p_spec.html regardless of the price. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> only the choice between the two..I'd get the P4S. </s>
<s> It has the 800FSB over the 533FSB. </s>
<s> I have used ASUS exclusively for ten years and wouldn't think of using anything else. </s>
<s> Why not think about the P5? </s>
