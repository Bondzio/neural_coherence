<s> Hello, about a month ago I've decided to build my very first personal desktop. </s>
<s> My first computer was a Dell laptop about 4.5 yrs ago and now I am looking into purchasing and building a desktop rig for college. </s>
<s> I'm an architect student at the University of Hawaii and have been interested all my life on how things are put together and work. </s>
<s> (Love to DIY, when I can) I plan one using my new rig for graphic design, like adobe, 3d modeling, like revit, maya, 3d studio max, CAD work, personal gaming, video editing and everything else that I could possibly use on a computer. </s>

<s> I am buying most of my parts from newegg.com I already own a gateway 22&quot; HD monitor and plan on purchasing the Logitech MX 3200 keyboard/mice combo. </s>
<s> Questions: 1. </s>
<s> Tools: I will be purchasing a tool kit for this build, but there is also other misc. </s>
<s> tools, such as a static mats. </s>
<s> I am looking into purchasing the Rosewill RTK-045 45 Piece Premium Computer Tool Kit - $29.99. </s>
<s> It comes with a static strap and I have been reading up on cautionary steps such as working on a wooden table. </s>
<s> Will the tools be enough? </s>
<s> or is the static mat a must? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I have done research on these parts and everything checks out according to the manufacture sites and manuals. </s>
<s> But, I do not know the mathematics for choosing a PSU. </s>
<s> Every part has its own power demand so do I just add it up? </s>
<s> How do you calculate the total wattages and amperage for a system psu? </s>
<s> is 700W sufficient for this build? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> The graphics card needs a 12v with at least 26amp, but all psu's are maxed at 18amps. </s>
<s> manufacture site certifies this psu but how do you do the math? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I am pretty confident and familiar with hardware but now I am researching bio's. </s>
<s> How can i understand Bio's. </s>
<s> I understand that I input the power current to each part and make sure the system recognizes each component but what else can i expect? </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Benchmarking/Testing: What are some key software to test system performances after build to break in all the components? </s>
<s> I read about Mark** so what are the others? </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> RAID: I have done research on RAID system but can anyone point me in the right direction for a description on the differences on each setup? </s>
<s> Which one is superior or a liking amongst everyone? </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> I know I must learn to crawl, walk, and then run. </s>
<s> but, overclocking sounds like a goal. </s>
<s> I don't want to kick myself in the ass, so overclocking is an afterthought right now, but its not too early to try and understand it. </s>
<s> With that being said, what are your professional opinion on someone like myself understanding overclocking? </s>
<s> if not this build than maybe the next. </s>
<s> These are questions that I have come across so far. </s>
<s> Any information and answers will be taken with great consideration. </s>
<s> Also, if any of you could give me tips on what to look out for in a first build, that would be great too. </s>
<s> Thanks a million and hope to hear from you all....... </s>
<s> your power supply is more than adequate. </s>
<s> a good 500w unit would be fine. </s>
<s> be aware that the p182 uses an inverted design (power supply is on the bottom) and some power supplies don't have cables long enough to reach some components. </s>
<s> toolwise, you shouldn't need anything other than a screwdriver. </s>
<s> the zalman cooler's a bit overpriced. </s>
<s> you can find a heat pipe cooler that's as effective and cheaper: http://www.anandtech.com/casecoolingpsus/showdoc.aspx?i=3022&p=4 unless you really want to pay full price, a q6600 ($300) can easily be overclocked to 2.8ghz or more (faster than the qx6700) especially when paired with a p35 based mobo. </s>
<s> (most will OC to 3ghz by simply selecting a 1333mhz fsb.) </s>
<s> the evga isn't a bad mobo, but if you don't expect to use sli, you can certainly get a mobo that matches or exceeds its features and performance for about $150: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3042&p=1 msi p35 platinum: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130097 asus p5k: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131180 ocz platinum ddr2-800 has the same timings as the hyperx but has a $40 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227179 western digital's new 500gb drive is only $10 more and matches or beats the seagate 7200.10 in most benchmarks. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136073 as for raid, that's basically up to you. </s>
<s> i prefer intel's matrix raid (available on some of the p35 boards) since it allows you to create a mirror (raid-1, data redundancy) and a stripeset (raid-0, fast read/write speed) on just two drives. </s>
<s> apps that use a lot of scratch space (like cs3, maya, etc.) </s>
<s> can benefit from stripeset. </s>
<s> unless you're overclocking, i don't think any type of burn-in is necessary nowadays so long as you stick to good quality components like the one's you've spec'd. </s>
<s> even if overclocking, an hour or so of super pi and a dvd rip to mpeg-4 will ferret out almost any problem. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_PI benchmarking is a matter of choice. </s>
<s> futuremark has free versions of most of their testing routines: http://www.futuremark.com/products/ </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt; 1. </s>
<s> Tools: Just make sure you ground yourself by touching the power supply before you do anything with the parts. </s>
<s> I have never bought any anti-static parts and been fine. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;But, I do not know the mathematics for choosing a PSU. </s>
<s> Every part has its own power demand so do I just add it up? </s>
<s> How do you calculate the total wattages and amperage for a system psu? </s>
<s> is 700W sufficient for this build? </s>
<s> There is a PSU Calculator on the internet (search google.) </s>
<s> It isnt to bad, I feel it is a little on the high end (over calculates) but should give you a good idea. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt; but now I am researching bio's Do you mean the BIOS for a computer? </s>
<s> Im not exactly sure what you were asking here? </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;Benchmarking/Testing Search the internet you should be able to find some. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;RAID: Again searching the internet well explain this way more then you ever would want. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;With that being said, what are your professional opinion on someone like myself understanding overclocking? </s>
<s> if not this build than maybe the next. </s>
<s> Overclocking now days isnt really that hard. </s>
<s> You are just changing some of the settings in the BIOS for the computer to run faster. </s>
<s> It really would come down to the motherboard you have and how it is build to overclock. </s>
<s> (And from what I remember the 680i isnt to bad). </s>
<s> The only thing is the Quad Cores dont over clock very much. </s>
<s> Dont expect a lot. </s>
<s> (the new G0 stepping should help some). </s>
<s> as for the psu calculator, i did use it, it gave me around 700W psu. </s>
<s> for the BIOS on the computer, i would like to know more about them. </s>
<s> I am looking online. </s>
<s> also, im considering a diff cpu cooler, ant idea's? </s>
<s> i've, lookedn at a bunch and they are huge. </s>
<s> i prefer a tower/heatpipe design but am afraid of space, and weight issues. </s>
<s> should i be worried about the weight? </s>
<s> looking at the TT 120 extreme. </s>
<s> here's an article about OC'ing a q6600. </s>
<s> with an asus p5k, the overclock to 3ghz is almost automatic. </s>
<s> the p5k reached a higher final OC than the 680i based xfx board and 680i board required more tweaking. </s>
<s> http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2007/07/25/overclocking_intel_core_2_quad_q6600/1 as for a cooler, if you don't plan on OC'ing agressively any good heatpipe unit will suffice. </s>
<s> if you don't OC at all, the intel stock cooler is fine. </s>
<s> wow, I'm considering the p5k MOBO. </s>
<s> too bad I cans use graphics cards in SLI, or can I? </s>
<s> I'll do more into it. </s>
<s> I just saw that the MOBO promotes ATI crossfire, can i use the geforce 8 series on these, and if i can, can i SLI them? </s>
<s> Sounds like a stupid question, but i just want to through it out there to understand the role a MOBO has in relation with graphic cards and the cards manufacture. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link, I am looking at getting the intel core 2 extreme QX6800 with a clock speed of 2.95 and overclocking it. </s>
<s> I figured with the QX6800 stock speed, when I overclock it, it will be less stress on the CPU and heat output. </s>
<s> I read in a forum that the max overclocking of those are in the 3.4 range to be stable, I'll probably sit just under that around 3.3 or 3.2. does this make sense? </s>
<s> Might be worth having a look at a couple of 250/300 Gb h/d's and set them up in raid formation, much easier to replace and recover from a crash than doing it on one drive in sectors. </s>
<s> Also make sure you can access all available USB ports on the motherboard, with a lot of graffics add ons, tablets, printers plotters, etc. </s>
<s> You will need all of them! </s>
<s> I don't know what your experience is, so, forgive me for being simple. </s>
<s> My suggestion is that you visit &quot;www.computerhope.com&quot; this site has some very useful information; i.e. </s>
<s> definitions of processor protocols, raid arrays, compatability of hardware, etc. </s>
<s> Also, have a look at this site &quot;www.overclockers.com&quot; ...eventhough you may not be planning on overclocking your processor, this site may have some very useful pointers as well. </s>
<s> Oh, as for static electricity, just be sure to discharge onto the case that you are building in before grabbing any components each and every time. </s>
<s> Just go at it carefully and slowly. </s>
<s> It's fun...enjoy. </s>
<s> Zalmans pretty good but there are better coolers. </s>
<s> See DanData.com . </s>
<s> Nortua makes really good quiet fans but sizes are limited. </s>
<s> Your going for lots of graphics capability you might consider water cooling especially for overclocking with a Quad core. </s>
<s> Look for slot capability with your MoBo. </s>
<s> You might want to make changes in the future. </s>
<s> Four RAM slots might be better then two, six would be ever better. </s>
<s> Just some points to ponder </s>
<s> I have done three DIYs and two upgrades in three years of retirement. </s>
<s> My Strategy: 1.Shop Newegg using the &quot;Power Search&quot; Speed read the customer reviews. </s>
<s> Link to the Mfg site for: manual, drivers, BIOS, etc. </s>
<s> (Newegg is the best for price, shipping, service, returns.) </s>
<s> 2.Do advanced Google searchs for specific product reviews and issues. </s>
<s> Your choices look great if cost is not a conisideration. </s>
<s> Some other considerations to Google research. </s>
<s> 1.Vista problems vs XP Pro. </s>
<s> 2.XP Pro 64bit vs 32bit for availabity of drivers. </s>
<s> 64bit is better supported by an AMD System. </s>
<s> SOME LINKS: Great DDR800, NO mfg support: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16820211174 EVGA motherboard( note extreme overclocking review): http://www.google.com/search?as_q=motherboard&hl=en&num=100&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=EVGA+122-CK-NF68-A1&as_oq=reviews%2C+ratings&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images Good fortune with tour DIY ! </s>
