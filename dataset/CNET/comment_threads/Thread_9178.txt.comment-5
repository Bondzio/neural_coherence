I dont have access to my routers settings at this time.
But Im sure it was set up properly since I have put many hours in research getting the proper settings for my specific router.
I guees my main question is.....Do routers tend to need replacing after a number of years?
?....I know there have been upgrades since my last purchase and more or less leaning to a new router..
