it turns out that the dns address provided by comcast would not let the players communicate.
i used new dns from opendns.com and got connection right away with the wrt54gs in place.
all lag issues resolved and streaming speeds are within acceptable limits.
thanks to the helpful people over at the tivo forums for the suggestion
