After some time, it again suddenly stops wireless broadcast until it's repowered. I've been having this problem for over 2 weeks now and tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times but couldn't solve the problem. Anyone, has experience in this issue, has any reccomendation ?
