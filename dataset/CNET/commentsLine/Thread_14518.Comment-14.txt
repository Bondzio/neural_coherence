of the mobo is probably the most ridiculous and ludicrous thing ever done with the washers.
if there were six or eight mounting holes it was the most outlandish waste of time [and incorrect] thing that could be done.
however, i have a book by bigelow {pc desk reference] that said to do that.
fortunately i worked in systems engineering with the people that design these boards and was involved with all aspects of the grounding techniques to use for high frequency grounding techniques and emi control [the noise on the dc voltage lines in computers is very high frequency, that noise is what is intended to be controlled/reduced].
mr. bigelow is simply incorrect.
we actually had a 14 layer board in the minuteman system.
[not a mobo, just a circuit board.]
