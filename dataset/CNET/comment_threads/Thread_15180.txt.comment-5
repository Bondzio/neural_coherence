&quot;How do I know which PSU I should get?&quot; what damasta55r said and make sure it is an ATX power supply.
i believe emachine has a regular ATX power supply so that should be fine.
look for dual fans and or one 120mm fans inside the psu.
this will prolong the life of it and also help remove heat from your case so that you dont need additional cooling.
personally, i recomend this model, as its in my machine now and has been running with NO problems for over 5 months now.
