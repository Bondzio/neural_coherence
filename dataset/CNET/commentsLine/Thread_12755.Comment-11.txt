aside from what i said before about my isp informing me they can't handle a fiber optics connection, this is what i think i know.
the connection you suggest is possible.
the only thing that is a major problem is that the router has to be able to handle multiple addresses at the same time.
most routers sold currently do not have that capability.
sadly, i'm not going to be able to try it out because of my own isp's shortcomings.
i'll keep trying to find out more info and check into changing my isp also.
if i find an affordable and practical solution i'll let you know.
thanks again for everyones help and input.
