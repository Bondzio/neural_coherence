<s> I was wondering if someone could give me the idea of the life of a typical , run off the mill DVD writer . </s>
<s> I have been using LG DVD writers since a long time on customer's PCs . </s>
<s> They have been good . </s>
<s> But recently I have seen that the DVD writers go bad after burning 20-25 DVDs . </s>
<s> The model of the LG DVD writer is GH22NS50 . </s>
<s> Now these writers are used on different PCs at different locations . </s>
<s> So I think I can eliminated bad power supply as the culprit . </s>
<s> Also all the time the DVDs were burnt at 8X or lower speeds . </s>
<s> Any suggestions ? </s>
<s> Thanks Sam PS : Specs of the PCs Pentium Dual core or Core 2 Duo Asus motherboard with G31 or G41 chipsets 2 GB of DDR2 or DDR3 RAM 450 watts SMPS </s>
<s> But I did encounter some go bad after a few months. </s>
<s> It was EASY to find out why. </s>
<s> Most of the cases had a hot enclosure with 2 drives back to back with no air gap. </s>
<s> Heat kills them fast. </s>

<s> I suspect a decent DVD burner drive last at least 18-24mos. </s>
<s> w/o some issue. </s>
<s> However, I have found more issues with poor DVD blanks and/or the environments sometimes employed, ie: factory floor. </s>
<s> Since many users try to save costs, buying some bulk purchase will at times bite them. </s>
<s> Often they work well, but can become flaky either because the blanks are poor or the burner is starting to show wear&amp;tear, the combo of each isn't rewarding. </s>
<s> While burn speeds can be auto-downgraded, many users still want the old level of before and thus complain of poor DVD drive. </s>
<s> Regardless, a typical home user should see in the neighborhood of 400 burns or so in maintained good PC. </s>
<s> I exclude other manufacturing issues or &quot;KIDS!! </s>
<s> !&quot; because I view that as a problem. </s>
<s> Poor handling of blanks and storage is not unheard of. </s>
<s> Just to be clear, if a DVD drive is beginning to show problems, just swap it out. </s>
