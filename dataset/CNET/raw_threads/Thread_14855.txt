I have a: DG834GT Router WG511T Card for my Laptop WG111T Dongle for my desktop All of the firmware/software/drivers are up to date and the router is set to Auto 108Mbps, but I NEVER achieve this speed. I've heard from others that it increses to this speed when it is needed. But if transfering 7GB of stuff doesnt encourage it what will?! I've also tried sending 7GB when there is a 10cm gap between the router and the computers. I've also obtained the older firmware for the router and set it to 108Mbps Only, but even this didnt work as it began broadcasting on another channel that wouldn't obtain the speed. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?
