so much seemed to happen or go wrong, it maybe better to simply swap the mtrbd.
out.
in most cases, no one can repair it and/or really the cost to repair vs. replace is mute.
while, you may not have oc'ed, you may have at least accepted hi-end values for operation.
regardless, for it to go all wrong suggests a basic but dependent ckt.
or item is core to the fault.
while, you think it maybe the ram, if you have other ram, swap them.
i find it hard to think the bios fixed anything and you're lucky it didn't act-up during the bios update.
also, because it worked before the bios update suggests it wasn't bios related.
while &quot;bad caps&quot; can be a cause, the usual end result is frequent reboots or no boots and not show the results you seems to state, imo.
considering all you had in there, it maybe the result of heat stress and it finally succumbed.
i would swap out the psu, then the ram, then the video card, and last mtrbd.
to see if those levels of change do anything.
yes, swapping parts is the usual attempt at a fix.
though, you can meter any voltages.
you can also, reseat every cable in the case, too.
