i would like to hook up my desktop system to my television to view dvd's.
in my computer desktop i have a nvidia geforce fx 5200 video card with a vga connection, s-video connection, and dvi connection.
the sound card is a sound blaster audigy 2. the television has an s-video-in connection, rca connections: video-in (yellow), left audio-in (white), right audio-in (red); and left audio-out (white), right audio-out (red).
what wires/components do i need to hook up the computer to the television to view dvd's?
thanks.
