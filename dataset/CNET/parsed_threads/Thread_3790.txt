<s> Ok I have an ABS system full of spyware. </s>
<s> I don't know how, but it recenty got messed up with the BIOS, etc. </s>
<s> Ok I want to reformat the whole thing, start all over again with the hard drives. </s>
<s> I do have a full version of the Windows OS. </s>
<s> I inserted that in the PC, but I can't boot the system. </s>
<s> It tells me to insert a floppy as the boot disk. </s>
<s> I want to insert a cd, and the floopy won't work. </s>
<s> How do I set the BIOS to read the CD. </s>
<s> I have never touched or played with the bios before, so what do I do? </s>
<s> how can u say &quot;but it recenty got messed up with the BIOS, &quot; but then u say u never touched or played with the bios before? </s>
<s> hmm i thought abs shipped restore CDs with their computers....maybe i'm mistaken accessing the bios varies from manufacturer...usually u push a button during post, f10, f8, control, delete, not sure...i would go with the function keys as most common </s>
<s> I messed around in the setup screen but I hope I didn't touch the BIOS. </s>
<s> I read in another post that I need to make the BIOS read my cd drive which I do not know how to do. </s>
<s> ABS did ship with a boot floppy, but that got damaged somehow. </s>
<s> to cd-rom. </s>
<s> If not, google microsoft windows xp setup floppy disks. </s>
<s> I know microsoft offers them on their site. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> I googled microsoft &quot;windows xp setup floppy disks&quot; and I got some results. </s>
<s> I still want to know how do I make my BIOS read my cd-rom drive first. </s>
<s> I know what you mean by playing around in Setup, but I don't know where to go from there. </s>
<s> In Setup I get like 8 options and that is all. </s>
<s> Anyone know what I do in Setup to make my cd-rom drive read my Windows cd? </s>
<s> I just want a fresh clean start all over again from my ABS system. </s>
<s> I want all the files deleted (including the spyware) and I want a new start. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You stated that you get eight options in your setup menu. </s>
<s> Those options probably have SUBMENUS in them. </s>
<s> Use the arrow keys to navigate through the menus, use the Enter key to select a menu or option. </s>
<s> Sometimes you may have to use the plus or minus keys to move items up or down a list. </s>
<s> Look for something that says: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order etc. </s>
<s> and submenus. </s>
<s> I read that old systems might not be able to boot from the Windows OS cd. </s>
<s> I tried using the floppy to boot but I think that my floppy drive is defective. </s>
<s> My system tells me that there is a Pri HDD error, then it tells me to insert a floppy to boot. </s>
<s> I downloaded the correct Windows boot floopy download from Microsoft.com, transferred what I downloaded to floppies, inserted them in the floppy drive, and the drive won't read the floppies. </s>
<s> I really need step by step instructions on how to make my BIOS read the cd-rom drive. </s>
<s> Well, did you find anything in the BIOS like: startup disk startup order boot volume boot disk boot order Computer model name? </s>
<s> Motherboard model? </s>
<s> Make & model of HD? </s>
<s> Can you pop the drive into another system to wipe it clean or run a formatting utility from the drive mfg? </s>
<s> I got someone else telling me to change my BIOS sequence so it can read my cd-rom drive first. </s>
<s> I did that but the computer still wants me to insert a floppy to boot. </s>
<s> Is there any other information I should post about this situation? </s>
<s> You never stated what version of windows you are trying to install. </s>
<s> That is important. </s>
<s> 95? </s>
<s> 98? </s>
<s> ME, 2000? </s>
<s> XP Home? </s>
<s> XP Media Center? </s>
<s> XP 64-bit? </s>
<s> Other? </s>
<s> Did the machine ship with Windows 98? </s>
<s> Has XP ever been successfully installed on the machine? </s>
<s> From what you have stated thus far, I have no idea. </s>
<s> I run Windows XP home. </s>
<s> I believe it came with 98 installed and another person upgraded the system to XP for me. </s>
<s> That person has moved elsewhere and I don't know where he lives. </s>
<s> My ABS did work with the XP and after it got infected with spyware, I didn't know what to do. </s>
<s> Somehow at first my computer worked fine. </s>
<s> It was able to boot regularly but I couldn't use my usb mouse or my ps/2 mouse. </s>
<s> I played around in setup and my computer couldn't boot. </s>
<s> It kept saying Pri Slave HDD error and it keeps asking me to insert a floppy and this is where I am now. </s>
<s> Look at the make of the hard disk. </s>
<s> Now head to that maker's web site and get a DRIVE FITNESS TEST. </s>
<s> Also, open the box up with the power off and gently push all the cables into their sockets. </s>
<s> Then boot that drive fitness test CD or diskette to see if the hard disk passes. </s>
<s> Looks like a hardware issue so far. </s>
<s> Good thing everyone here makes a backup. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The hard drive is really old and I have 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> Both of them should be older than 4 years. </s>
<s> I'll see what I het with the test. </s>
