i would expect such an overtaxed power supply to show many such issues.
that alone may or may not be your issue.
other issues are: 1. bios.
latest only or suffer.
2. some other item in the brew.
i once found a bad usb device that stopped the reboot.
hitting reset was the final workaround since a) it worked, b) cheap fix.
