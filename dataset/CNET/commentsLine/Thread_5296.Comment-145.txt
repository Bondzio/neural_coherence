my first pc was an hp.
i replaced the power supply and bought a gpu (8600 gt) that same day i bought it.
i liked it and it served me while but i build my own pcs now.
the final product can have better quality hardware at a lower cost than if you purchased it pre-built.
i will admit that it takes some technical know how and a lot of homework but to me it's worth it.
i will never buy another pre-built pc again.
