1.1.1	After working/burning CDs and DVDs for the last five years I 've come to the conclusion that this medium is the most UNRELIABLE media the industry has ever adopted .	St
1.1.2	First is the un compatibility problem with various dvd players/recorders .	St
1.1.3	A home made dvd will not play on all dvd players .	St
1.1.4	Either will a dvd burned on a stand alone dvd recorder play on all makes and models of dvd players .	Sug
1.1.5	It 's a compatibility nightmare !	St
1.1.6	Second is the delicate nature of the medium itself .	St
1.1.7	The outside layer is very prone to scratches and nicks .	St
1.1.8	One little scuff mark can render the medium completely unusable .	St
1.1.9	One literally must handle this medium with silk gloves and with more care than a vinyl LP record .	St
1.1.10	Third is the big question of longevity of the data on the disk itself , we all must admit that the jury is still out on this .	St
1.1.11	In the meantime we have heard various reports of a few years to 100 years .	St
1.1.12	Now we hear of cautions that this medium must be sheltered away from extreme light and in an environment of controlled humidity and temperature .	St
1.1.13	I advise my customers who request that their vhs , slides , or 8mm movies be transferred to DVD for preservation - that this is not the solution .	St
1.1.14	Yes , I will transfer to dvd only on their request and that they sign a release that the work is not guaranteed on a dvd format .	St
1.1.15	I 've experienced that 30 % or more of my customers have numerous problems with playing their dvd on their home machines .	St
1.1.16	I had one customer steaming mad , a dvd of her family home movies , it played great on her home machine .	St
1.1.17	But when she tried to play this same dvd at her daughters home ( 1500 miles away ) the dvd played with sputs and spurts and then stopped only 2 minutes into the program .	St
1.1.18	You can imagine the disappointment !	St
1.1.19	Boy did I get an earful when she called me on the phone .	St
1.1.20	From this and many more bad experiences I have lost many future customers and all faith in the CD/DVD medium we have today .	St

1.2.1	That DVD players appeared on the market well before DVD recordable media ?	Ques
1.2.2	Also , do you remember the format war of DVD-R and DVD+R ?	Ques
1.2.3	And finally did you notice that some players list neither , one or the other or both ?	Ques
1.2.4	In closing I note the + or - on the media and include a note that the player 's media compatibility list must be checked .	St
1.2.5	I 've had no issues that you speak of and since I put them in boxes or sleeves the scratches issues have been neglible .	St
1.2.6	Then again I pick them up from the edges as noted in the care and handling guides .	St
1.2.7	As to extreme light , this issue applies to vinyl LP , VHS tape and more so nothing new here .	St
