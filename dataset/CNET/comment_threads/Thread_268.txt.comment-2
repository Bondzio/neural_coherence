I assume you just cannot run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable.
There are 2 popular options.
The ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge.
The wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup.
The system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless.
