<s> I took a HDD I installed in an other computer I dont use any more (the drives only about a year old) and put it into my new computer. </s>
<s> Computer starts up fine... blah blah blah no problems. </s>
<s> Everything works great but my HDD is supposed to be an 80 gig but it tells me there is 37.2 gigs on the HDD total. </s>
<s> I plugged it in and formatted when I started XP. </s>
<s> Did I miss a step? </s>
<s> &quot;I plugged it in and formatted when I started XP. </s>
<s> Did I miss a step?&quot; Yes. </s>
<s> I didn't read the step where you used the Disk Management tool to partition the drive prior to format. </s>
