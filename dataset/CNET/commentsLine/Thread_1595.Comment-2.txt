what will irk most is that service and support will cost more than replacing the printer.
perils of lower costs.
i will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer, but i have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges.
the epson has some superfine nozzles and i can't say if non-epson ink will clog.
but will note that your warranty is void now and i'd open the window before tossing it.
