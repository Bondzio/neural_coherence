<s> Hi, If i powered on the router for 24*7, will it get overheated? </s>
<s> Any concern? </s>
<s> They are designed for being on permanently. </s>
<s> Some routers don't even have an on-off switch - gotta unplug them from the wall. </s>
<s> However, this is based on normal conditions of reasonable ambient temperatures and locating the device where it has breathing room around it. </s>
<s> Installing it in the boiler room or burying it under a pile of stuff could result in overheating. </s>

<s> So I moved it out from under another switch and its been happy ever since. </s>

<s> thanks for the reply how abt a modem? </s>
<s> It has a on-off switch. </s>
<s> does that mean it cannot be on 24*7? </s>
<s> you mean ur router overheated cos u powered on it for 24*7? </s>
<s> That was the cause and not the 24x7 operation. </s>

<s> as Bob has indicated, it is not the length of time it is on, rather it is whether or not it is in a place with enough ventilation for the small amount of heat to be naturally dissipated. </s>
<s> Putting it underneath something else will prevent the warmth from escaping into the air. </s>
<s> Ok... thanks alot for the clarification! </s>
<s> Ok... thanks alot for the clarification! </s>
<s> I had used DI-714P+ (802.11b) for about a year and now have switched to DI-724P+ (802.11g) for a month. </s>
<s> I notice that DI-724P+ generates more heat than DI-714P+, probably because of its compact design. </s>
<s> Anyway they both work 24/7 reliably. </s>
<s> How about yours? </s>
<s> i need to restart the router almost everytime after a long period of time of accessing internet. </s>
<s> what posibility may caused these happen ? </s>
<s> Is the firmware current? </s>
<s> You didn't reveal your model number and what firmware you have in it so the forum can't look for you. </s>
