&quot;I can sniff out if it's the moterboard by stripping the machine to the bone.
All that I need to power up is... 1.
Power supply (ok, obvious) 2.
Motherboard.
Nothing else!
No CPU, RAM, drives, nothing else is required.
I don't need the power on push button but use a jumper or screwdriver on the pwr switch connection on the motherboard.&quot; Hope that explains it.
