1.1.3	-- Yes .	St
1.1.4	( For what ?	Ques
1.1.5	Do you ever fear it will fail on you ? )	Ques
1.1.6	-- Sometimes .	St
1.1.7	( When ? )	Ques
1.1.8	-- It depends .	St
1.1.9	( On what ? )	Ques
1.1.10	-- Never .	St
1.1.11	( Why not ? )	Ques
1.2.1	First , I use laptops .	St
1.2.2	I do n't even own a desktop PC .	St
1.2.3	Second , I just do n't have that much data to store .	St
1.2.4	About the only data I keep are photos .	St
1.2.5	I burn them to a DVD .	St
1.2.6	They are much easier to store and use .	St
1.2.7	I could use an old hard drive as an external drive but I do n't even use the portable external hard drive I already have .	St
1.3.1	Yes , I do reuse hard drives .	St
1.3.2	To experiment , like with Windows 8 pre-release version and for temporary storage .	St
1.3.3	Temporary , because ALL hard drives will eventually fail .	St
1.4.1	I do not replace a drive until it quits .	St
1.4.2	And hopefully I have recently backed it up !	St
1.4.3	Boo-rah !	St
1.5.1	I use old hard drives as paper weights ... ... Well , on second thought , I do keep them around because I work on computers for a living .	St
1.5.2	I just had a machine the other day that the customer wanted Windows 7 put on it , and it was an old Dell that was previously running XP Home .	St
1.5.3	The hard drive that was on it was rather small , but still big enough to support Windows 7 , but not much more .	St
1.5.4	We 're talking about parallel drives here folks , so I added a second drive to give them some more storage .	St
1.5.5	Mobo did n't support serial , so even if I wanted to go out to buy one , it would n't work in this particular system .	St
1.5.6	So , if you work on systems , they have a use .	St
1.5.7	But if you do n't work on systems for a living , then you might as well get rid of them .	St
1.5.8	It also depends on how big the hard drives are .	St
1.5.9	If it 's a small one , I 'm probably just going to write it to zeros ( to protect my customers ' data ) and throw it in the garbage .	St
1.5.10	But if it 's a big one , it does n't hurt to keep it around in case you might need it .	St
1.6.1	- Yes = Sure why not , it works and there 's always some PC that needs a different and BETTER drive .	St
1.6.2	- Sometimes = If the need is there , why not and it 's a known working drive , & quot ; good to go & quot ; .	St
1.6.3	- It depends = It always depends on need , cost , and availability not to mention its already in hand .	St
1.6.4	- Never = Ca n't say never unless its too old or weak on capacity .	St
1.6.5	I make it a point to toss 20gb or less .	St
1.6.6	However , if its broken , rarely does it make past the recycle bin .	St
1.6.7	But , its not like I do this every day or even monthly , maybe 3-4 a yr.. Heck , there are 3Tb drives out there .	St
1.6.8	If I have a 500Gb and I used it for 2yrs+ , then looking at an affordable 3Tb is inviting .	St
1.6.9	It 's been my experience that a good drive will last at least 5yrs .	St
1.6.10	or more .	St
1.6.11	However , if a drive pukes at 3yrs .	St
1.6.12	or less , its not worthwhile to save other than data and hope the warranty is still there .	St
1.6.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	Yes , I reuse drive but only because I have an OS and applications image stored on an external drive .	St
1.7.2	I 'm frugal to the extent that I 'll squeeze the last bit of life out of any drive .	St
1.7.3	Current drive capacities are such that storage space is n't really a worry .	St
1.7.4	Smart testing and other disk checks provide warning of impending failure .	St
1.7.5	No specific reason to ditch an old drive before it shows signs of stress .	St
1.8.1	Several years ago , I saw it mathematically demonstrated that the drive had to written over for at least 3 times to ensure that nobody could retrieve the data .	St
1.8.2	Now , since some cd 's are 3 dimensional , the 3 time write over supposedly does n't work .	St
1.8.3	At a Business show a few months ago , some guys were selling a & quot ; Drive Shredder & quot ; that actually chops up the drive into tiny metal and plastic pieces that resembles the way a paper shredder works .	St
1.8.4	How important is your data ?	Ques
1.8.5	How paranoid are you ?	Ques
1.8.6	Do you think a hammer and saw could accomplish the same thing ?	Ques
1.9.1	I am using an acer aspire desktop - last one til they started making laptops only , and it is loaded .	St
1.9.2	BUT I keep my old HP brand XP with upgrade for some of my games that do not trade up easily .	St
1.9.3	My Acer Aspire is running on Windows 7 , and I had to do some fancy footware to get it to go on some of the games written for much simpler machines .	St
1.9.4	SO some things I doubt would go to Windows 8 .	St
1.9.5	Therefore the XP is still on board .	St
1.9.6	I can save other stuff , like family pictures on it as well .	St
1.9.7	Who prints pictures ?	Ques
1.9.8	My addresses for email are on it as well .	St
1.9.9	some are changed , but the really old ones are still somewhat useful .	St
1.9.10	There are just enough things that just do n't transfer from machine to machine - like the pinball machine !	St
1.9.11	I love it , but it wo n't transfer out of HP-XP to the Aspire .	St
1.9.12	Darn !	St
1.9.13	!	St
1.10.1	Once replaced the 4GB hard drive with a 32 , kept the old one just the way it came out ; the self-installed OS did miss some tricks which the manufacturer had included , and I was glad to swap back to the old drive for OS , swapfile and most used software , installed remaining software and copied all files to the large drive .	St
1.10.2	Regularly sort saved items and transfer all I want to keep to external HD , thus built-in HD remains spacious enough to hold installed software and current files .	St
1.10.3	And this way there is an external back-up in case notebook goes AWOL .	St
1.10.4	Re-using the old HD is likely more an enthusiast thing , where people replace a 500GB drive with a 750 , or a 5400RPM with 7200 .	St
1.10.5	As an aside , for me , speed really increased when adding RAM , not when upgrading the HD .	St
1.10.6	Also ensure better cooling of notebook - i.e .	St
1.10.7	not using it on a warm lap as that way the thermal envelope is less likely to be reached - meaning the cpu and HD slow down when reaching around 50C to avoid overheating , on my desk the surrounds are 20C , on my lap 35C .	St
1.10.8	It 's the main cause of slow computer when room temperature reaches 30C .	St
1.10.9	But I digress .	St
1.11.1	Time to make jewelry and recover some really 'neat ' magnets to play with from the HDD case !	St
