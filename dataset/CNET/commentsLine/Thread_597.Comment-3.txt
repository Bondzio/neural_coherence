after you tried the ubunty trick to copy the files in folder out (maybe better copy all files to your backup 2 tb drive) you can try a chkdsk on the drive to do the necessary repairs.
a full chkdisk (including surface check) after that won't harm at all.
if it happens repeatedly, this might point to a hardware issue or to you handling this drive incorrectly.
let's hope it was a one time glitch that won't happen again the next 5 years.
