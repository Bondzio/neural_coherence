you need to see what runs on 240 and what does not.
the radio shack convertor has to be of sufficient size to handle what you plug into it.
what parts run directly on 240 (or thereabouts) should not be on the convertor.
the radio shack people should be chatty about this so take advantage and talk about it there since this medium is not as chatty.
