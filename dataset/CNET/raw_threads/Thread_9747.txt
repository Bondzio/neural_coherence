Alright this is pretty weird (to me): I'm on the computer and the screen goes black. I can hear the computer still running, though it's much quieter than normal. I open it up, turn it back on, and see that none of fans (chipset, CPU, cooling) plugged into the motherboard's fan headers are spinning. The motherboards's LED light still turns on and the hard drives still spin when I turn it on, so I know it's nothing to do with the power supply (it's less than a month old anyway). I tried plugging the fans into the power supply, bypassing the mobo, using an adapter like this: http://home.comcast.net/~johngafnea/adapter.jpg When I did this, the fans all began working again, but the computer still wouldn't boot. The LED lights would start, and the hard drives would spin, but no POST beeps would sound. Is my mobo trash?

Anyone know what causes this to happen in the first place?

The off/on thus hot/cold operation of the system can cause wiring/harness, ICs, and/or cards some movement preventing a good contact. One reason, I mention reseating cards and harness several times to break the metal-metal contact crust/tarnish plus fully reseat, same. It happens from time to time, especially in systems that experience alot of heat build-up. Just like a car after running a longtime, upon shutdown you notice the pinging/tweeking of metal as it cools. good luck -----Willy
