I've had it for about a year without any problems, everything updated fine from the installation CD and from Windows Update there after. A week ago however, I decided to reformat my PC, something I've done a few times, again without any big problems. This time however, the video drivers (and monitor drivers as well as a result of this) fail to install. I've tried using the CD again, but after installation and restart, my pc will freeze during Windows loading screen (at the agp40 or similar loadup command). I went online to get the latest drivers, but installation fails as it does not recognize any valid hardware. There's a hotfix on AMD's website for this series, which I've tried, but it's the same result as the CD. I've also tried using generic VGA drivers as some troubleshooting guides recommend, but this again will only lead to my screen freezing at loadup. Finally, Windows Update itself does not recognize the hardware either, so I'm not getting any updates for it, nor is the Automatic Driver search working on it. Any help on is appreciated.

Try once more from the start. If no luck again, see if you still can find another AGP card. Kees

But even then, I had to install the drivers from the CD. I tried it again, this time using the ATI driver found on this site, but the same thing happens. Windows freezes at the same command line. I just went through some boxes and I found my old ATI, so I'll load it up again and see if I can get those drivers to work. Would there be any issues if I then try to load the HD2400 again as an upgrade to see if it'll be recognized then?

The main reason for doing it was that my system performance was being slowed down by a number of programs that I didn't use any more and I prefer full cleanup when there are a lot of these programs rather than just uninstalling them and encountering errors later on.

I did check for available bios updates, but the only one available was for the pc series I have, but not for the model itself (it mentioned 'specific for...'. I've never had to reinstall those particular drivers before, so I might be missing something there. How would I go about finding this information?

But that message also happens if you download the ATI drivers. For AGP you have to find the AGP HOTFIX drivers from ATI. The ones you find are only for PCIE so be sure you get the AGP HOTFIX and absolutely get that motherboard package installed first.

As for the AGP hotfix, yea found those and they cause the freeze at startup, same with any older or generic drivers. The PCIe were the ones that failed to recongnize the hardware (as mentioned in the hotfix) and would not install at all.

Proffitt	7/4/09 7:48 AM	1.24669368E12	So this link and driver?	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=240442&lang=en I see this used the Intel chipset. If so, this is a link to a Compaq driver required. http://download.cnet.com/sp25336-exe/3000-2122_4-111586.html Sorry but the model DID NOT tell what I needed to know to find the Intel.com drivers I would install. Let me ask this. -&gt; Which Intel chipset did this machine use? Bob
12608	9	348370	3073743	3073593	samkh	7/4/09 8:12 AM	1.24669512E12	Your Compaq 7RPM11	has nVidia UMA onboard http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&product=240442 so your ATI is an upgrade. Do a clean XP install without the ATI inserted, then insert the ATI to let PnP detect it, then install the ATI driver.

Thanks.
