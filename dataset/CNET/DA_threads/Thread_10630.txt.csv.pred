1.5.3	or is it because of the power supply?	St
1.6.1	250 watt power supply DirectX 9 Does not specify RAM requirements here.	St
1.6.2	You may wish to search them out in the EVGA &quot;support&quot; page, as well as other hardware requirement to run this card.	St
1.6.3	How about the most resent driver?	St
1.6.4	The specifications: http://www.evga.com/products/moreInfo.asp?pn=256-A8-N313-AX&family=GeForce%20FX%20Family Evga support: http://www.evga.com/support/ Drivers: http://www.evga.com/support/drivers/ This thread untracked.	St
1.7.1	The requirement (from manual) for the fx5500 are: IBM or 100% PC compatible with genuine Pentium II or AMD K6-2 class processor or higher.	St
1.7.2	One available AGP 2.0 compliant slot or better, or one available PCI slot (as required for your specific card).	St

1.7.7	I think my PC exceeds all these, but still i have the problem!	St
1.7.8	nd yes, i have the latest drivers installed.	St
1.7.9	My friend tells me to reinstall OS, but its a real pain, and not guaranteed to work, btw, there is no problem with other tasks in the PC, just games.	St
1.8.1	You have a dated system.	St
1.8.2	Increasing ram and swapping out the PSU seems to be your best bet.	St
1.8.3	Under XP OS, having 512mb is practical, 1gb being the most sensible.	St
1.8.4	Gaming just puts it all in a basket and tests the wankle out of it, so upgrade.	St
1.8.5	Since, you system is older don't expect the newer demanding games to run as well too after the upgrades, they want so much more as you review those requirements so beware.	St
1.8.6	If possible, you may want to look for a better cpu as well for the total upgrade path options.	St
1.8.7	Yours *may* support upto 2.4ghz/P4 and that too needs better PSU.	St
1.8.8	tada -----Willy	St
