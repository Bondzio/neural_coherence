Hey everyone: My cooling fan is starting to die.
On starting the computer the fan vibrates hard (up & down grinding tone (as in a bearing going out)) for 2 to 3 minutes.
The 875P chip is on a gigabyte GA-81875 with a 478 socket.
After the initial warm up time the sound goes away and it runs smooth from then on.
Does anyone know where to purchase just a replacement fan?
It seems if you want the fan you have to buy the mother board but then it's older so a new board then a new CPU $$$$$.
Thanks Craig
