1.1.1	I recently moved my computer far enough away from the monitor and keyboard that I needed to add extension cables to make up the difference.	St
1.1.2	The monitor is working fine but just about every time I start the computer, I get an error message that the keyboard was not found or not present.	St
1.1.3	If I unplug the usb cable and plug it back in and push the reset button on the computer, it usually starts with no problem.	St
1.1.4	I have tried 4 different cables and the same thing happens.	St
1.1.5	Can anyone tell me why this is happening and possibly how to fix it?	Ques
1.2.1	I see no mention of make or model but I did run into a machine that needed a BIOS setting to be able to use the USB keyboard without an error message on startup.	St
1.2.2	Something like USB Keyboard support and telling it not to halt on errors.	St
1.2.3	The lack of the PS2 connected keyboard was an error according to it's programming.	St
1.2.4	And there are limits to cable length.	St
1.2.5	If you over reached the length, this won't help.	St
