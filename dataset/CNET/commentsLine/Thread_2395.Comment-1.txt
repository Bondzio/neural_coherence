i'm looking to get a printer for my home, i know to get an inkjet printer.
i just don't know if i should get a printer with seperate color cartridges or an all in one.
and if i get an all in one, when one color goes out do i have to replace the whole thing?
i just want to know which would be the most cost effective.
since i noticed some of the cartridges cost almost as much as the unit itself!
!
