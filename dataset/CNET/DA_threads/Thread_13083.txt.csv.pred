1.1.1	I was just wondering if there is any big power difference between NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 and NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT.	St
1.1.2	I don't want to go out and buy another supply supply.	St
1.2.1	you need at least 350watt for 6800gt.	St
1.2.2	fx5200 is actually low-end card, very low power user also	St
