1.1.1	Grandson's comp (compaq presario) had recently had hard drive cleaned and we are in process of re-installing hardware...but, the 2 dvd drivers are not found on system and can't find the back-up discs done when comp was purchased (lost in move I guess) How do we find these drivers to install them??????	St
1.1.2	Thank you all in advance!	St
1.2.1	Those drivers are on the Microsoft Windows CD (all versions from 95 to Vista.)	St
1.2.2	If the CD/DVD drives do not show up in Explorer, it's not due to these drivers but something else.	St
1.2.3	Tell more and try this article.	St

1.3.1	Grandson had evidently lost the windows cd and backup cd's when moving, so, do not have that aid ( Grandson's comp IS registered with windows though)....is there any other way to get drivers to download free?	St
1.3.2	Grandson's Mom is helpless with comp and I am just a touch more able, lol...but not much where this area is concerned!	St
1.3.3	(Grandson is autistic, and if he knows, he isn't sharing!)	St
1.3.4	Grandson's comp is a Compaq Preasio with windows xp home edition service pack 2	St
