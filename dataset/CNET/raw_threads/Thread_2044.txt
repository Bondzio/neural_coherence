My laptop connects no problem, via cable modem. What devices do I need to connect to internect, it shows a nonworking pci icon on device manager, also nic card shows running but it may be missing driver, any advise on this. Thanks Dan

Unfortunately, that is the best advice we can give you because only you know the make & model of that laptop. Now, if we knew what you know, then we could tell you where to download all the drivers (the laptop maker's website). BTW, where is your driver CD that came with the computer?
