(Sound Blaster Live 5.1)	Whenever I put in the software to install my Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 sound card i get an error message saying &quot;Setup could not detect any Sound Blaster audio card on your system. Please ensure that your Sound Blaster hardware is properly installed before running this setup program. Setup will now exit.&quot; Yet when I go into device manager it detects that I have installed the Sound Blaster card. My motherboard came with onboard sound which I disabled and I tried the card in different PCI slots. What should I do????

Microsoft will not install motherboard drivers for you. Share more about the machine. 3. I can flumox up the install with other than default BIOS settings and overclocking. Try stock and boring safe speeds. 4. And a final thought. Is it really a SB Live card? Some scammer was hawking any old PCI audio card they could and putting SB Live stickers on everything. CD-R media for the drivers were a give-away something was amiss. Bob

Actually, I've got (almost) the same problem (it's an external USB Audigy 2 NX), and none of the things you described apply. I know it's not a dead card, because we are getting sound from it. And, like the guy before me, the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed. Anybody got a clue?

But I'd like to install the AudioHQ and other Creative software too... With my &quot;old&quot; Live! Value card everything was OK but this 5.1 Digital seems to be somehow strange... E.g. WinXP detected the Value card and used correctly its MS drivers but did not with this 5.1.
