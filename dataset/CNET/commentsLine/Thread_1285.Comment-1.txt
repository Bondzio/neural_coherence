im looking for a web cam that works well with aim video chatting.
i have the logitech quickcam pro 4000 but that seems to not be working correctly anymore.
a message comes up saying that the &quot;request has timed out&quot;.
so if anyone knows a web cam that works well with aim please let me know.
thanks.
