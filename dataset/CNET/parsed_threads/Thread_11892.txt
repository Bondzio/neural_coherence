<s> I have and old Dell laptop I would like to clear it and use it as an external hard drive. </s>
<s> How would I do that? </s>
<s> I have windows Xp on both laptop and desk top. </s>
<s> Use the laptop or the hd of the laptop in an ext. </s>
<s> case? </s>

<s> The laptop itself I would like to leave it conected in my network and just be able to access files from it. </s>
<s> The probelm is it runs windows xp and takes alot of the laptops memory. </s>
<s> can i clear it and use it as storage? </s>
<s> How would I do that? </s>
<s> Here you already have it setup to access and basically got storage present. </s>
<s> If you don't like XP because it seems a resource hog, then find some Linux OS you can live with and use that as storage. </s>
<s> You problem isn't storage as your 1st ? </s>
<s> posed but rather with XP. </s>
<s> You probably could be better served using some ext. </s>
<s> USB case with HD and just deal with it as an extension of your current main system rather than a network. </s>
<s> Using a NAS(purchase) setup would be more open to a network storage and any system that has access to it. </s>
<s> The last option, would be to keep your laptop XP OS and add/replace with a larger HD to increase storage itself. </s>
