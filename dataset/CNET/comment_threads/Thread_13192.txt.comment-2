it will, to an extent.
You won't get 4 gigs though.
The system resources are why.
PCI memory addressing will take up a portion of what the 4 gigs will use leaving much ram with only around 3.4 or less, depending in actual use.
So in theory, yah, in actuality, no.
Vista starter is only like, 1 gig I believe but don't quote me, the rest on 32 bit should support it.
