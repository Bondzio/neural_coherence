in fact i did have &quot;make bootable&quot; checked both times a tried.
under startup disk, the folder on that drive showed up as bootable, but when it came to push and shove, it would not start up from there.
i guess i'll switch to another brand.
i liked the idea of an fw800 drive, but being able to boot is the key element i need.
thanks for your suggestions.
regards, ed
