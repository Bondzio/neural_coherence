hi, i am a little new to networking, so please be patient with me.
well, i have a desktop computer running xp pro with 1 ethernet jack which is connected to a dsl modem.
i have a laptop which is running 98 with 1 ethernet jack.
is there a way i can simultaneously let both computers acess the internet?
if you require any info please, just ask.
thanx ibrahim jadoon
