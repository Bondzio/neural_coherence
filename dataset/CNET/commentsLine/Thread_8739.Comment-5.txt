if i was tasked with fixing that, i would populate the installation apple's own routers for a test.
having the same ssid proved to be problematic and i found some gear confused (some call that a bug!)
by this.
i moved to ssid names like zone1, zone2 etc.
and told the devices to autoconnect when needed.
let me be clear that seamless roaming is not implemented today.
it's a wish they would do that.
