<s> my enermax is dying, or at least, the constant shift in PIO mode of my hard drives makes me wonder. </s>
<s> I have an enermax here that I have always admired. </s>
<s> but which one to get to replace it? </s>
<s> I have a kd7a mobo amd 3200 cpu i think 3 hard drives and one liteon dvd burner found enermaxes on tigerdirect. </s>
<s> any advice? </s>
<s> on which to get or where to buy? </s>
<s> need at least 400w i think. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>

<s> Get something with at least 19A on the 12v rail. </s>

<s> also look at antec and ocz. </s>

<s> It does hurt to get the largest p/s unit you can afford. </s>
<s> The extra wattage is room to grow on and the name brand helps. </s>
<s> It suggests that each power leg provides ample voltage at a stable level. </s>
<s> If you don't buy Enermax, then Antec Vantec, or SparklePower. </s>
<s> You should check: http://www.tomshardware.com for test reviews and the like. </s>
<s> Don't fall for cheap units that offer 500W unless they've got some generous return policy, too often, cheap is cheap. </s>

<s> Well thank you very much for this advice. </s>
<s> I think I may go with antec just because they are readily available at local retail outlets. </s>
<s> I realize that the Halcyon days of $40 power supplies are gone, and I'll have to spend about 90 plus dollars on this thing. </s>
<s> I should think 430 + watt Watts ought to do me. </s>
<s> I am assuming that most power supplies are compatible with this two year old motherboard. </s>
<s> I do want one that is relatively quiet if I can get it. </s>
<s> Any specific recommendations would be wonderful, as there are several variation in antecs in this watt range (dedicated circuits, fans, etc) Thank you all! </s>

<s> http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=20430 i have the 480 watt version and i swear to god i NEVER hear it. </s>
<s> and that is from a quiet btx case. </s>
<s> it wont disapoint konny </s>
<s> well I am off to buy the 430 watt version (3 hdd's and ond dvd drive in there, kd7a mobo) unless someone tells me different in the next 30 min! </s>
<s> thanks so much for the help and support. </s>
