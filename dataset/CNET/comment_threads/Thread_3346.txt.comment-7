I see you found how to control the firewall so that's a good step in the right direction.
I offer ZERO support for Zone Alarm as you can tell.
That's for ZoneLabs to do, so I leave that to them.
It's sad to see people struggle so with this product.
As to www.wown.com, it's all you do need to know, except for the firewall issue.
Which I noted.
What more can I offer people?
