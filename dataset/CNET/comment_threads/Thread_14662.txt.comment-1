I have an Anthlon XP 1900+ CPU.
In my bios, there are three setting.
CPU frequency 100mhz/RAM 100mhz, CPU frequency 100/RAM 133mhz, and CPU frequency 133mhz/RAM 133mhz.
Which is correct for this CPU?
It seems the bios only displays the correct name for the CPU with the 133/133 setting.
All else and it says 1200MHZ CPU, which I know is wrong.
Still, I'd like to know.
