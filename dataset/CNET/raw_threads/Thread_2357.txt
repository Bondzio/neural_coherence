Below are a list of components that I want to use. What I would like to know is: are these components compatible with each other? I know I may get a lot of replies about how you would recommend something else instead, but I am just worried about compatibility of the hardware. I am mainly concerned about compatibility between the motherboard, CPU and RAM. (Voltage compatibility and MHz rate of RAM.) Thank you! =) CASE Corsair Series 800D Full-Tower Case (Model CC800DW) MOTHERBOARD Intel Desktop Board DX58SO2 CPU Intel Core i7-990x GPU EVGA GeForce GTX 590 RAM Corsair Dominator 24GB Memory Kit (Model CMP24GX3M6A1600C9) POWER SUPPLY Corsair Professional Series Gold AX1200 (Model CMPSU-1200AX) LIQUID COOLING (for CPU only) Corsair Hydro Series H80 CPU Cooler (Model) I am using an OWC Mercury Electra 6G 240 GB SSD as a boot disk and four Seagate Barracuda XT 2 TB hard drives for storage.

I've read far too many posts about lackluster performance and the buyer never received an exact install procedure. Bob
