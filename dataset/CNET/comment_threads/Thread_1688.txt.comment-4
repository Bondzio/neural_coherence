ZA is set to standard.
I've even disabled it.
What happens is, after I surf, then let the PC sit idle for a while, I click either IE or FF, and the first attempt fails.
Usually a second attempt will get on line, but sometimes not.
It's all so random other than the fact that after it sits, it won't get on line.
A reboot and all is normal, until it sits for a while.
