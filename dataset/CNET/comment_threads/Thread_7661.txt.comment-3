I actually just unplugged the CPU and tried reseating it a few times, but I get the same result (I also Tried the RAM idea, different choices between the 4 sticks on different tests) Without the CPU in at all I get the exact response, no real computer action but all fans immdiately power on and whirr loudly.
This makes me think it's the CPU because every one of the fans are working, even the GPU fan/ PSU fan, and Heatsink fan, but no actual computing is happening.
I can't even get to the bios, and that's what concerns me, Without the CPU, would the Mobo load it's bios?
It just seems like there aren't any POST or beep codes at all.
Either way I've just RMA'd the CPU to Newegg and hope to get a replacement for this soon.
I'll be back replying on any help I get here after The processor is fresh and I can try it again.
Thanks Willy for taking the time
