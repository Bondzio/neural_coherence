1.1.1	I am working on a computer for a friend and the port for the onboard graphics isn't sending any information to the monotor.What I would like to know is if i install a new graphics card to the pci-e slot.Would this fix the problem and if any geforce 5500 or above pci-e graphics card will work?	St
1.2.1	if the onboard 6100 graphics are out, the chipset (and the mobo) could be toast.	St
1.2.2	test with a pci-e card and be sure to test all built-in functionality (usb, sound, etc.)	St
1.2.3	if the mobo is bad and it's out of warranty, this biostar should drop right in.	St
1.2.4	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138269 microsoft may allow you to reactivate the windows license without repurchasing.	St
1.3.1	Do you get any bios display at all.	St
1.3.2	If not, try shorting the bios &quot;clearing pins&quot; to return to defaults and reboot.	St
1.3.3	If needed, set the jumper to allow bios clearing.	St
1.3.4	If still no display, reduce system to basics and see if the system responds at all.	St
1.3.5	It appears you may have a blown PSU(power supply) if you open case and observe the cpu fan, what does it do?	St
1.3.6	The other half is a bad mtrbd.	St
1.3.7	or component holding down the system.	St
1.3.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	thank you for your advice on the t6420.It turns out like you said the motherboard was bad and needs replaced.My next question is will i be able to salvage anything from the old one to use on the new one.Such as processor memory...ect or will i need to replace all of it?	St
1.5.1	a old VGA card in a PCI slot first.	St
1.5.2	You can get them for a couple of dollars at flea markets and used electronic parts stores.	St
1.5.3	Just something to test the motherboard and chipset.	St
1.5.4	The Mobo will recognize any VGA thats working.	St
1.5.5	In answer to your original question yes your PCI-E card should work to test this as well.	St
1.6.1	windows should boot with the replacement (and a few driver installs).	Sug
1.6.2	remember, call microsoft if the replacement mobo forces you to reactivate.	St
