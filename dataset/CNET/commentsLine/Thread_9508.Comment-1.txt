i'm planning on buying a new desktop next month.
i'm mainly going to use it for composing music (cubase or logic) and just normal web surfing.
i don't play games but i do watch movies on my computer a lot i used to think that mac was way ahead of pc in almost every aspect but now i think they both have their pros and cons.
i'd like someone to recommend me a pc as good as or better than the imac at the price of the 21.5 inch model or simply persuade me to stay with mac.
