1.1.1	I am currently building a computer myself for the first time.	St
1.1.2	I am wondering if setting aside a hard drive just for windows 7 and another hard drive for all my games, video editing software etc will benefit me in anyway.	St
1.1.3	I currently have a Western Digital AV-GP WD10EVDS 1TB ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16822136496 ) and I was looking at buying Western Digital VelociRaptor WD3000GLFSRTL ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16822136375 ).	St
1.1.4	If seperating Windows and my software on seperate hard drives does benefit me, which hard drive should I put windows on and which one should i put my software on?	St
1.1.5	I even thought about putting windows on a SSD and using the velociraptor for software and the 1tb hard drive for just storage.	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance!	St
1.2.1	In fact, I do have Win 7 installed on one.	St
1.2.2	But the issue of putting software on a different drive in another matter.	St
1.2.3	I don't do gaming but unless your games can install completely on a separate drive and put nothing in the Windows folders or registry, I'd not put them on a separate drive.	St
1.2.4	Most all software will put entries in the registry and add libraries and other parts of itself to the Windows folder regardless of where you target the installation.	St
1.2.5	In that case, I think it's best that the entire program be on the drive Windows boots from.	St
1.2.6	I'd reserve the larger drives for data storage and part of your backup scheme.	St
1.2.7	Part of my own backup scheme involves keeping entire primary HD images on larger internal and external drives as this allows me very quick and nearly complete disaster recovery capability.	St
