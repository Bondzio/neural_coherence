it is apparently a fact that ibm hard drives are not available.
their production was handed over to hitachi who improved them.
having used both the ibm and now hitachi i can testify to improvement.
i must say that i still have a 30g ibm and it has been running well for many years.
seems that maxtor has a problem yes.
