1.1.1	I just bought a Seagate 750GB Freeagent External HD , w/USB , Firewire , and most importantly eSata connections .	St
1.1.2	( Model # ST307504FPA1E3-RK ) I wanted to get it going immediately , and living in NYC I also bought the only PCI-X card I could find from Tekserve , a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E I installed the card and driver on my Powermac G5 Dual 2.0 , ( 10.4.10 ) , and although System Profiler recognizes the card on the PCI bus , it will not recognize the drive through the Esata connection .	St
1.1.3	I tried all four of the ports , and nothing .	St
1.1.4	Disk utility shows nothing there .	St
1.1.5	The G5 does recognize the drive through the USB 2.0 connection .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know whether this card is compatible or not , and I ca n't find any information on what would be online .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know how I can get the eSata to work ?	Ques
1.1.8	Much obliged .	St
1.2.1	Assuming that you have the required eSATA cable and that the PCI-X card is installed correctly , and you have tried another PCI-X slot , my next move would be to call La Cie Tech Support to find out why this did not work for you .	St
1.2.2	A Google of the PCI-X card turns up a number of hits but all are related to a La Cie RAID system and not about the card itself .	St
1.2.3	P	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	And that is exactly what I did .	St
1.3.3	I called Lacie tech support , and they had me install the latest driver from their site , ( as opposed to the driver that came on the disc with the card ) , and Voila , the Seagate appeared on my desktop !	St
1.3.4	So , I am good to go .	St
1.3.5	Thanks again for your reply .	St
1.3.6	Sincerely , Richard	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	I also called LaCie and they do n't give drivers for Mac .	St
1.6.2	So ... please clarify .	Sug
1.6.3	Do you have a Mac or a PC ?	Ques
1.6.4	If you have the solution , a lot of people out there would love to get the solution .	St
1.7.1	The original poster had purchased a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E for his PowerMac G5 .	St
1.7.2	On their products page , for this card , it states that Mac drivers are not required for this device , which is a little confusing .	St
1.7.3	LaCie have posted drivers for OS X on their download page Here and these may be the drivers that the poster was referring to .	St
1.7.4	If you called LaCie with the same problem , on the same card , after January 07 , then LaCie was not altogether truthful with you .	St
1.7.5	They updated the driver for OS X ( 10.4 ) so that it would load on Intel or PPC Macs .	St
1.7.6	Hope this helps P	St
1.8.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.8.2	However , I have the LaCie PCI eSATA card .	St
1.8.3	I am going to just return it .	St
1.8.4	I down graded back to Tiger and its not even showing up on the System Profiler anymore .	St
1.8.5	Thanks for the help though .	St
