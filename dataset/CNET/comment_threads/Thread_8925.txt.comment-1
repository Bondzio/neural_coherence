We are looking to buy a color laser printer to print our concert tickets.
We are a non-profit organization with limited income.
I want to find a printer that initially wont cost us a fortune but I would also like to find one that wont cost us a fortune to run.
It needs to be a duplex printer that can handle about 1250 copies a month.
Does anyone have a suggestion?
