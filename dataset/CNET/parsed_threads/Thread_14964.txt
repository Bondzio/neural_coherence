<s> I would like to protect all of the records I have stored on my flash drive. </s>
<s> Is there a simple way of doing this? </s>
<s> Please tell me how one can keep files private on a flash drive. </s>

<s> I purchased a 2 Gig U3 flash drive for practically nothing at STAPLES. </s>
<s> It does have a password protect feature. </s>
<s> However, it also has a feature for surfing the web anonymously. </s>
<s> It does not work. </s>
<s> It only hides your cookies from a site. </s>
<s> There are sites that will report to you what they can see from your computer. </s>
<s> I tried that when using the U3 anonymous feature. </s>
<s> The test site could still see everything, and could tell me where I had been surfing before coming to them. </s>
<s> I then tested the history feature in my IE7, and it recorded all the sites I had visited while using the U3. </s>
<s> So, yes, you can password protect, but the anonymous surfing feature is not functional. </s>
<s> The only &quot;anonymous surfing&quot; I found is to use the public library or wifi hotspot. </s>

<s> The simplest thing is probably to buy the Lexar JumpDrive Secure, which has an encrypted, password-protected, subdirectory built in. </s>
<s> Another possibility is to buy software at: http://www.folder-password-expert.com/ Maybe there is freeware that will do the same thing, but I haven't looked into this. </s>
<s> I had a lexar secure flash drive and the password feature failed. </s>
<s> I found very poor support from lexar in trying to recover my data. </s>
<s> They acted as though as they care less. </s>
<s> The tech support person acted as though I disturbed either his sleep or his lunch. </s>
<s> I don't know which. </s>
<s> I hung up and called again and got the same response. </s>
<s> I never recovered my data. </s>
<s> I have not bought any lexar product since that incident. </s>
<s> I take my chances in not having a secure flash but at least I feel that I won't loss my data to a failed password feature. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I have got a few old pen drives and I was thinking if there is a software which can be installed in a pendrive, so everytime pendrive is inserted that software will ask for password. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What I meant to ask was that whether I can use my old pendrives for storing data securely. </s>
<s> I am sure newer pendrives like you mentioned U3 and others can do this as they have some inbuilt feature, but can this capability be added by use of a software preferably a freeware. </s>
<s> A download is over at the noted link. </s>
<s> I tried opening this link http://www.folder-password-expert.com/, but its not opening, guess its down. </s>
<s> For plain ol' pen drives you can try USB Vault from ZDNET - http://downloads.zdnet.com/download.aspx?docid=224888 You do need to be a registered user (it's free). </s>
<s> Or try Rohos Mini Drive - http://www.rohos.com/free-encryption/ also available from CNET downloads at http://www.download.com/Rohos-Mini-Drive/3000-2092_4-10729531.html?tag=lst-0-1 hth </s>
