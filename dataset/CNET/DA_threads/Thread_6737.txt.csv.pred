1.1.1	The nForce 590 SLI Intel chipset from nVidia is the last piece of hardware that I'm waiting on so that I can finally build a core 2 duo system.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone here have any clue as to its release date?	Ques
1.1.3	I heard it had a parallel release with the Conroe line (released to manufacturers Thurs July 27th).	St
1.1.4	The retail release for the Conroe E6600 and above is August 7th, I believe.	St
1.1.5	But I have yet to see a definitive release date on the nForce 590 Intel board.	St
1.2.1	Unfortunately I can't help, at least not now.	St
1.2.2	I am hoping to build MAximum PC's Dream Machine 2006 and will need an nForce 590 SLI Intel Edition motherboard that can accommodate the Intel Core 2 Extreme X6800 CPU.	St
1.2.3	If I hear anything I will try to post.	St
1.3.1	The Maximum PC Dream Machine 2006 looks really nice this year -- you should check out the overclocking on the E6400... http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2802 Hopefully the nForce 590 Intel Edition will come out soon so I can start enjoying conroe!	St
1.3.2	!	St
