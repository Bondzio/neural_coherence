6089	0	222637	2343643	NR	Coryphaeus	12/10/06 1:07 PM	1.16575602E12	I'm still having trouble. . .	with one of my PCs getting on line. After a boot it works perfectly and will for hours. But if I let it sit idle for a while I can't get on line. A reboot fixes it. I've tried everything short of a format and reinstall XP Home SP-2. (See previous thread.) Changing router ports (broadband connection), Winsock Fix, reinstall networking, everything I can find at Windows Help, nothing fixes it, not even repair connection. Can someone recommend a little cheap, free utility like some sort of keep alive to ping something every once in a while?

If you right click, then click on engage internet lock or stop all internet activity, it still might not connect. Try turning off the radio and wait about 10 seconds then enable the radio. That should work. Rick

Adapter sleep/power save mode is disabled? DHCP client lease time set in router or none? What network adapter model?

What happens is, after I surf, then let the PC sit idle for a while, I click either IE or FF, and the first attempt fails. Usually a second attempt will get on line, but sometimes not. It's all so random other than the fact that after it sits, it won't get on line. A reboot and all is normal, until it sits for a while.

Removed and reinstalled Networking. Adapter power setting is NOT set to allow Windows to power off. Have set router with DHCP assigned to this specific MAC address, this is my web server.
6089	5	222637	2344620	2343643	Coryphaeus	12/11/06 2:22 PM	1.16584692E12	Now that I think about it. . .	This started happening after I cloned this drive. This was wife's PC and had a 20 Gig HD. Because she was saving a lot of music for her iPod, I cloned an 80 Gig drive using MaxBlast. The clone went perfectly and have had zero problems. Except this. That's why I reinstalled the NIC from the motherboard software. I've also run sfc, and done an XP repair install. I disabled the NIC in the BIOS and installed a D-link PCI NIC. Upon powering up XP went nuts, said I had made major changes to my system and wanted to reactivate. I said ok but I couldn't get connected. I removed the NIC, put it back the way I found it, powered up, XP wanted to activate, I said yes, done. I'm just short of doing a reformat and reinstall. Unless someone can point me to a keep alive utility.

6089	9	222637	2345814	2345592	Coryphaeus	12/12/06 7:02 PM	1.16595012E12	Can't. . .	It's my web server for my site, it's on 24/7. I don't surf often, just for updates and such. But it's a pain to reboot whenever I need to update XP and my Anti-Parasite Suite. Just a little simple keep alive utility would probably solve my problem.

Rick People had the same problem with AOL a while back. I can't remember the program that they used.

I have never used this software, so I don't recommend any of these from experience. Check it out: http://www.vicman.net/lib/continuous/ping Scroll down to FREEping - Server Pinging 2.0 . Part of the description reads as follows: FREEping is a free ping software utility which will ping all your IP addresses in free-definable intervals. FREEping automatically pings in the background and shows statistics for each pinged hosts.
