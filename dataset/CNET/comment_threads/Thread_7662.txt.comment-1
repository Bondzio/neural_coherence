OK, I know this sounds wierd, but it has really happened and I'm bummed.
I have an AMD Athlon XP 2200+ (1.8 GHz).
Everything was going smoothly until--as usual-- I had to format my HD and reinstall XP Prp SP2.
After installation, for some reason my CPU is recognized as AMD Athlon Xp 1500+ (1.3 GHz).
It is really killing me.
I would really appreciate it if someone could tell what in the world is wrong!
