my system: athlon xp 2000, inno3d 128mb geforce4 mx440 se, motherboard gigabyte ga-7dxe, 768 mb ddr ram.
whenever i play mohaa online, when the map is the v2 rocket facility, at some random moment within a few minutes of getting there my computer will go into a restart (with no warning and no blue screen - just reboots itself).
i know it is not a problem within the game because it used to work fine, and i also have exactly the same problem when playing the siege map in the game elite force online, and again all the other maps work fine.
this problem began to arise after i had visited windows update to get the sp1 service pack and all current fixes (for the purposes of trying to fix a problem on another game, freelancer, which actually did the trick that time).
i have updated every driver on my computer, tried switching off anti-virus, firewall and various other programs to no avail.
if this rings any bells with anyone out there, i'd appreciate any tips....cheers.
