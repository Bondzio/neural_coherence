&quot;i had the 2 computers networked to each other but now i lost the connection between them and can't get them to find each other.&quot; since it last worked?
upgrade to sp2?
viral or spyware infestation?
have you checked the workgroup names?
done a search for computer from each computer?
tried to ping each others address?
