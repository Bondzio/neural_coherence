The only item that looked odd was the two connection on the server.
Since what a router is, what a hub is and what each does is on the internet I don't duplicate that here.
At the top of this forum is a sticky note about how to use more than one router.
As to multiple hubs, that's been done for years with little more than plug in the cables.
