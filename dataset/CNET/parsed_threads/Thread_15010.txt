<s> I own an HP Pavilion 9000, about 2 weeks old. </s>
<s> It came with Vista, I had it downgraded to XP Home Edition Service Pack 3 by someone who does this sort of thing. </s>
<s> All drivers installed with no problem, it work(ed) great. </s>
<s> The laptop was not able to connect to the new wireless router (Lynksys WRT160N) I had set up on my desktop. </s>
<s> While on the 24 hr chat with a Lynksys rep, she had me walk through some steps that determined my settings were right. </s>
<s> All seemed right, still no internet. </s>
<s> I was able to take it with me on vacation a week ago, and was able to access an unsecured wirless network located somewhere in my parent's condo building. </s>
<s> On the way home I noticed I could not access airport wireless networks anymore. </s>
<s> I kept getting a message on the wireless icon that said &quot;Unable to connect to wireless network&quot; and the icon has a red x on it. </s>
<s> I have decent computer skills but no wireless skills at all, for the record. </s>
<s> When I got home, I could not connect to the new router still. </s>
<s> I tried switching the wireless on and off, tried disabling then enabling, checking firewall settings, no avail. </s>
<s> In the Wireless Network Connection box, the wireless card can detect local wireless networks in my area, including mine. </s>
<s> Sometimes it says its connected, but I still have that red X on the wireless icon and that message telling me it is disconnected. </s>
<s> More stats: Wireless card is Broadcom 4321AG, status is Not Connected. </s>
<s> When I attempt connection, I get this message in Details: IP address: 0.0.0.0. </s>
<s> Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0. </s>
<s> (my network info) Signal Strength: Excellent Encryption: Disabled I tried to get my computers IP by doing a cmd ipconfig/release, and the message I got was: &quot;No operation can be performed on local area connection 2 while it has its media disconnected. </s>
<s> No operation can be performed on Wireless Network Connection whie is has its media disconnected.&quot; I downloaded WinsockXPFix to restore, but this did not work. </s>
<s> I am not even sure if this is the problem. </s>
<s> I am on the verge of reinstalling the driver for Broadcom, since I hear so many bad things about downgraded systems from Vista. </s>
<s> Any insight? </s>
<s> As last resort...Anyone know a decent online chat support that doesn't cost too much money? </s>
<s> Did you see the post about lost internet connections due to a windows xp update? </s>
<s> It's hitting too many. </s>
<s> Hhrmm. </s>
<s> That's interesting. </s>
<s> Have not seen it. </s>
<s> Do you have a link? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
