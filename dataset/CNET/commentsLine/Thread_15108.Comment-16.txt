hi, well i can tell you that i bought a &quot;ocz gamexstream 850w/ sli&quot;-ready&quot; in fitted it in my dell 9100. i'm currently running a 8800 gtx with a 850 psu and it works like a charm.
the psu doesn't fit 100% but it still works.
the reason why the item doesn't fit is the old psu has a gap were it slides into place and the new one doesn't it rest on top of the clip.
hope this helps
