When I installed the software that came with the scanner, it installed 10 separate software packages, and neither do a simple scan. All are so complicated it is hard even to know which one to scan with. I want to use PaperPort and it will use the scanner, but the DESCREEN capability is not there. It only appears in HP Essential software, and to use it, the scanner makes 4 separate scans. It does not seem possible to save any scan settings that include DESCREEN. When I asked HP on-line help, I was told the answer would cost $25. Thanks

Browse the disk and see if there might not be a way to do what you want to do. Many times if you load the FULL software package you will wind up with a lot of superfluous stuff you may never use. I am NOT sure with HP units, Mustek and some other scanners have many options from which to choose but I would browse the disk and see what you might be able to do.

I am trying a couple of generic scanner programs, &quot;Art-Copy&quot; and &quot;Pro-Vue&quot;. Both run the scanner fine, and both say they will descreen, but having rpoblems finding that feature. Probably have to buy before it works. Thanks Jim West

Generally that feature is part of a software package such as Adobe Photoshop and may not be packaged with basic software provided with a scanner. You can probably download a generic version from the net. Good luck!!!
