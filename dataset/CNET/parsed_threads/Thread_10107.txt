<s> I built this computer on CyberPower PC. </s>
<s> I'm looking to upgrade to Vista, and enter the computer gaming world. </s>
<s> I want to have a computer that can basically do a little of everything and handle it all efficiently. </s>
<s> This was basically built off what I thought seemed sufficient. </s>
<s> Please review and comment. </s>

<s> here on Cnet Vista Advisor hope this helps jonah ., </s>
<s> PC Pro's review says this about that card: &quot;Verdict: Poor performer but worth a look if building a media centre The 7300 LE is the latest addition to Nvidia's entry-level range. </s>
<s> As it's essentially an under-clocked 7300 GS, its performance is too poor to recommend it as a gaming card. </s>
<s> With its 450MHz core clock and 256MB of 333MHz memory, we saw unplayable frame rates even at 1,024 x 768 in both test games - 15fps in Call of Duty 2 and 13fps in Far Cry - and it isn't exactly overflowing with features either.&quot; Thus, that isn't high end. </s>
<s> Now if you put a nVidia GeForce 8800 GTX that costs about $600 into it, that would be high end and really high end is if you use SLI on two of those cards. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> Thanks but I've only built the computer online, I don't own it yet. </s>
<s> First, find a better, more underground website to pick up a strong computer... like www.magicmicro.com or something local. </s>
<s> Next Get an intel dual core. </s>
<s> AM2 can suck a fat chode when it comes to heat and power, then noise and power, the list goes on into repair Last : If you get SLI, you should start with a decent video card like the 7600GT. </s>
<s> Read on it. </s>
<s> It is the best for the money. </s>
<s> then you can buy another when they get even cheaper. </s>
<s> DO IT... oh yea.. MagicMicro.com </s>
<s> Check your sound card Vs video card compatibilities; if you visit creative labs you might find you've got a lucky combo.. Jonah's advice sounds good to me, it's nice to hear & see the proof for yourself B4 jumping in the deep end. </s>
<s> Maybe you're confident about online purchase, it certainly cuts out the middleman. </s>
<s> If you're going gaming there's always going to be some formats that are out of bounds depending how much warranty u've left. </s>
<s> If you purchase a High Wattage PSU it will run cooler if it does NOT draw its MAX/on the wattage side..I'm not a GAMER but have read some of their suggestions and 600-watts seems the Minimum.. .. </s>
<s> The Vista HOME Premium..I personally consider the XP-Professional a better OS..as a FAST OS..but who knows where XP is going(??).. </s>
<s> I might consider a Business Version of Vista..but check w/Microsoft on GAMING.. .. Dual Layer-DVD Burner../do you do Digital Photography(?? </s>
<s> )..plus you'll need a DL-DVD Home Player for the Television Set..you might want to do away w/DL for standard DVD-combo.. .. as far as the rest of your LIST#.. </s>
<s> Your really just going to have to BUILD the darn thing and find out for yourself.. .. That's why I chose INTEL Products..for my first PC-build.. even INTEL declares a PC-build risky.. .. </s>
<s> I would come up w/a second system.. FOR GAMING.. ..750-watts PSU..120-GB System Drive..NO Partition..RAM for GAMING(don't know)but KINGSTON makes a Hyper-X RAM(Gaming RAM).. XP-Professional OS.. Run a single...DVD-combo DRIVE/my TOSHIBA DVD-combo is a &quot;screamer&quot;.. .. </s>
<s> Check on the SATA over ATA HD..the differance is really the CABLE(it)eliminates the Interferance between other Hardware inside the TOWER/the FLAT-data cable is a emitter of frequencies..and SATA allows for multiple HDD's inside the TOWER.. .. </s>
<s> I know nothing about Video Cards/but have read that they can DAMAGE equipment because they are OUTPUT Devices.. And the Configuration problems I have encountered in my PC Projects often have SETTINGS going out of Configuration..since I'm not GAMING..I only need to make an ADJUSTMENT..no damage.. What's the NEW Vista going to do too your Video Card SETTINGS..? </s>
<s> ?..do SETTINGS-chageing ruin the machine or external devices..??.. </s>
<s> .. </s>
<s> I would also suggest a METAL TOWER...all metal..none of that PLASTIC-stuff..I've seen TOWER-prices like $$40.00/I'd get METAL for GAMING.. .. </s>
<s> It took me one month to research my first PC-build.. </s>
<s> I actually had to purchase a cheapo' DELL to complete my research.. </s>
<s> I built it in about one hour.. </s>
<s> But it was another month before I Signed-ON to my Desktop.. .. </s>
<s> There are ODDS/ENDS..here INTEL Products might save you some grief.. </s>
<s> But INTEL guarentees NOTHING..and suggests you only BUY-BOXED Products..Intel BOXED/what-ever..it needs research..and lots of notes. </s>
