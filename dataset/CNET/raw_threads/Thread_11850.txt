11255	0	200460	2151751	NR	p.sutherland	8/23/06 12:16 AM	1.15629216E12	Mouse misbehaving	System: HP Pavilion dv 1000 notebook. XP (2). Mouse Pad: Synaptics PS/2 touchpad External Mouse: I Rocks optical HID compliant. Can anyone please advise how I can resolve the following? I want to have the pointer &quot;snap&quot; to a default button in a dialog box. Neither the pad, working alone, or the external mouse will do this. I have taken this action: Control Panel&gt;mouse&gt;pointer settings&gt;check snap-to box&gt;apply. It works for a while but the setting is lost after I awake my notebook from &quot;standby mode&quot; Any help to resolve would be appreciated. Thanks for any help. PS

It's not something you are doing but time to ask the makers of your laptop and mouse for a driver that doesn't have this bug. Bob
