<s> Hello, my mother-in-law is now a widow and watches a lot of tv/movies etc. </s>
<s> She has satellite for tv viewing, dvd/vcr etc. </s>
<s> What I would like to get her is a media device that will play back .avi files that I can send her via USB stick. </s>
<s> Mostly videos of her grand kids etc. </s>
<s> Photos would also be good. </s>
<s> Is there a unit that I can hook up for her to her LCD tv that can play home movies etc. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The easier the menu scrolling to find content on the USB stick the better. </s>
<s> She has a PC that she does not use. </s>
<s> No Internet access where she lives. </s>
<s> We use a USB wireless stick when there for access. </s>
<s> I looked at a Western Digital unit about a year ago, but can't remember which one. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Even without internet it plays from USB sticks very well. </s>
<s> About 99 bucks for the Logitech Revue. </s>
