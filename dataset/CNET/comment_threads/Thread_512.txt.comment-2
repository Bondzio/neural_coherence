At current California prices for electricity the financial cost for the electrical power difference between the cards would be $37.74 (based on $.1436 per kWh) per year, if you run your PC 24/7.
I'm clueless how many tonnes of CO2 that is.
Obviously it'd be cooler to run.
And sexier cuz it's new.
XD
