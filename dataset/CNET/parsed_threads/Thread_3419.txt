<s> Hi, I have connected USB disk drives to my Win XP PC in the past and worked fine. </s>
<s> However, having recently borrowed a 50 GB usb drive, I cannot view this in My Computer. </s>
<s> It is visible in device manager, in disk manager it is marked as &quot;Healthy (active)&quot; but has no volume label (also no info in the &quot;file system&quot; column). </s>
<s> when i right click, the only option is &quot;delete partition&quot;. </s>
<s> in DiskPart, the disk is visible and &quot;online&quot; but does not appear as a volume. </s>
<s> i have noticed that in device manager the Location is Location 0. </s>
<s> Not sure if this is right or not, as the C Drive location is Location 0 (0). </s>
<s> the disk has data on it which i need so cannot format etc, can anyone help me get access to this disk? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> in computer management/disk management, open help, go to the index, and open the importing disks , overview topic. </s>
<s> the command line info should be what you need. </s>
<s> btw, location 0 is the position of the disk on its controller. </s>
<s> i assume the usb disk is the only loaded/connected usb drive and is thus location 0. your c: drive is location 0 on your hd controller. </s>
<s> thansk for the reply, but when i try to import the disk i get a message saying &quot;the disk you selected is not part of a group that may be imported&quot;. </s>
<s> any ideas what this means? </s>
