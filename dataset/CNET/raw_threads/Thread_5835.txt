My Dell laptop has been used some years, and it seems something wrong with the laptop ac adapter, so I bought a new Dell PA-12 AC Adapter from http://www.papatek.com/Dell-Adapter/Dell-PA-12-AC-Adapter-19.5V-3.34A.html , the new one is good, but I still want to know, if the old one can be repaired, who can give some advice? Thanks.

My guess is that you won't be able to do it for under $10 (if it is something obvious and simple) and really hurting for business. But who knows..give it a shot

However, if you don't mind the hassle of bringing it down to a repair shop to check it out, then just do so. They will be able to advice you whether your adapter is repairable and at what cost. At the end of the day you will need to decide whether it's worth while to fix it.
