the surface looks perfect.
but yes, bet it'll be expensive - probably double my budget.
in the meantime, any recommendations for the best value pc laptop at a budget of 500 uk pounds / 600 euros / 800 us dollars ?
i'd go for 10.1&quot; for weight of 1.3 kg or less, and am a sucker for big brands such as samsung and hp (can't imagine buying a lenovo, assus or acer).
