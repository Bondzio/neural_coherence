1.3.2	I can't get on AIM or anything, but the signal strenght is strong and it says its connected to the wireless router...	St
1.3.3	I dunno?	St
1.4.1	I think most probably you are not connecting to wireless router, although the signal is strong.	St

1.5.1	I had that problem twice with me Sony Viao.	St
1.5.2	I was using Norton antivirus software, somehow a glich would occur in my security settings and block my access to the wireless internet connection.	St
1.5.3	I had to go into Norton and change my settings.	St
1.5.4	Also if you are running windows xp and those security settings are set to high that might also block you from the internet.	St
