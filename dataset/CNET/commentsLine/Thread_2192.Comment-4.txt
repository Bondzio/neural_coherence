they aren't newegg built there are: acer ibm toshiba fujitsu and abs notebooks suggested there customizing isn't a bad idea, except that dell sucks, and hp is expensive also 64-bit pentium m's would cost a fortune (a normal 32-bit pentium m 2ghz is around $600, consider a 64-bit, and it's intel...we are talking $1100 cpu here) you don't need 64-bit btw and the next mobile chips from intel aren't going to be 64-bit pent m's their going to be dual cored chips, on the yonah core should be out in q4 64-bit chips atm aren't gonna help you in the future, as everything is going dual core...
