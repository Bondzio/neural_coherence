there is nothing better than a custom built pc, you build it yourself or hire someone, that way you know exactly what type of components are being used.
i learned my lesson, and do not really trust computer manufactures a whole lot any more, as they not only use the cheapest parts they can find, but most of they're tech support is a nightmare.
if i had to really buy a desktop i would go with apple (i have 2, ad they run vista really well, and tech support is amazing), my second choice would be hp, than dell (but be sure to buy from the business division, cause the other each support is horrible) and try to stay with the xps line.
i loved the vaio's, but sony saw no future in continuing to build desktops, but if i need a laptop, i would only trust apple and sony.
out of all of these, sony has the best tech support, waiting times are usually under 4 minutes, they now what they are doing, speak perfect english, and do not treat people like dummies that have never used a pc (unless that's your case).
anyways, conclusion is, custom computer (companies like powerpc can build one for you), or apple's mac pro or even the mini for those that do not need intense graphics, cpu and ram; and you'll be very happy.
