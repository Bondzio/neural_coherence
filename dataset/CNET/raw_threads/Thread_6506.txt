Both computers are able to access the internet and both WERE able to see and access the other computer but one day it just stopped happening. Both are still able to access the internet but I can't see computer 1 while on computer 2 and vice versa. I have a 2wire modem that I am using. Nothing has changed that I can think of that could have caused this to happen. I have disbaled the firewall on both laptops and still a no go. I've also tried going through windows and &quot;setting up&quot; the network again on both laptops. I've also tried a suggestion from another thread on this forum that involved setting up the wrong network, rebooting, and setting up the correct network but this did not work. I can't figure out how to disable the firewall on the 2wire modem just to try this out but I don't think that is the problem. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!! Thanks.

I think the suggestion in the other thread worked which had you set up the network the wrong way, reboot, set up the network the right way, and reboot. I think I just didn't wait long enough for the network to catch.
