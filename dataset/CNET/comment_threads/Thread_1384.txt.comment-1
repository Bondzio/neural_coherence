Hi all, I'm having a particularly annoying problem with my PC at home.
At seemingly random intervals, the power will just die.
Then it won't come back on.
I have to unplug the power cord from the outlet end and then plug it back in before the PC will turn on again.
Any ideas on what would cause such a bizarre problem?
The sudden power loss isn't as baffling as the fact that I have to unplug and plug it back in again.
Could a flaky power cord be the culprit?
(It's never that simple, I know...)
