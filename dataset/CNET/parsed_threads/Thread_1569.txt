<s> hi i have a pc with the following spec: Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit Intel G33M Motherboard 500-Watts PS Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 @ 2.33Ghz 2 x 1Gb Patriot PC-6400 RAM @ 800Mhz GeForce 8800GT OC WD 500Gb Hard I know that he maximum supported ram is 8Gb on my pc, i currently have 2 GB in dual channel and i notice vista is a bit slow on startup. </s>
<s> Will i see a performance increase if i upgrade to 3Gb? </s>
<s> What if i upgrade my ram to 8Gb by adding 2 more 2Gb ram sticks? </s>
<s> Will having unused ram decrease my pc performance? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Upgrading to 3GB I'm told (I use XP) should be plenty for Vista. </s>
<s> Anything after that would not be recognized by your computer once fully booted up, but it can still be used; you'll see it if you go into your BIOS. </s>
<s> Extra RAM will never decrease your performance. </s>
<s> although your pc can handle 8gb, vista 32bit will only be able to address 4gb and only 3gb or so will be useable. </s>
<s> slow startup is usually caused by crapware or uneeded apps. </s>
<s> run windows defender and use its &quot;software explorer&quot; feature to see what's running currently and what runs automatically at startup. </s>
<s> get rid of software you don't use and don't allow products like quicktime and acrobat to put their 'helpers' in the startup group. </s>
<s> read this posting for more info: http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=429&tag=nl.e539 </s>
<s> startup performance. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> That's not the problem. </s>
<s> 2G is more than enough memory for a bootup. </s>
<s> If the bootup is slow, look for some other cause like running processes. </s>
<s> Turn off quiktime, real player, printer programs that load on startup, etc. </s>
