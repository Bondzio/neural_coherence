<s> I have a few quick question. </s>
<s> I have a HP pavilion 505w. </s>
<s> I have just installed one gig of memory and bought a new Radeon 9250 256Mb PCI video card (no AGP) on board video sucked. </s>
<s> That last thing I want to do is find a better way to keep my system cool I am wondering if there are any good external cooling systems that would get the job done. </s>
<s> If there are no good external cooling systems can anyone recommend a good cooling system that would be compatiable with my system. </s>
<s> What do you mean by external, water cooling? </s>
<s> Any other cooling merthod is increase air flow or some peltier assy.. </s>
<s> Since, you mentioned a HP system, whatever you get has to fit, physically as HP cases tend to be cramped. </s>
<s> Try for ideas or hints/tips/clues look for &quot;modding websites&quot; that explore just about any changes that can be done to a system provided you're game enough. </s>
<s> Further, here are some links: http://www.coolcomputing.com/reply.php?topic=108&forum=6&post=284&quote=1&mod=2 http://www.frozencpu.com or similar enjoy -----Willy </s>
