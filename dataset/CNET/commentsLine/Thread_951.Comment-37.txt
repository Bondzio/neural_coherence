hi all, the fat32 or ntfs can be related to the size of your c:\ drive.
if it is 'under 32gb's', just leave it as fat32.
your windoze 98/98se/me software o/s's, 'will not' fdisk anything (&quot;accurately&quot;), over 32gb's, so you might as well leave it as fat32, for your win xp/home-pro.
it'a a different story, if you have a '3rd party partitioner'.
i like and have 'partition commander v8.0'..., (i had partition magic), but prefer this more, after using them both!
now, if you have a hdd, (any size), and you are running win xp/h or p, and 'do not' have any 'partitioning software', and want to turn it into an ntfs drive, (but do not want to reformat your h/d)..., then use the win xp's &quot;built-in&quot; converter!
say you just wanted to make your c:\ drive into a ntfs drive, (from the fat32, that it is now), even if you have 10 to 20gb's of data on it.
do the following: go to 'start'(taskbar) &gt; 'run' &gt; type: cmd and hit enter.
at the dos window 'prompt' &gt; type: convert c:/fs:ntfs ...and hit enter.
(follow the prompts), like, it might just tell you that it 'can't convert', because 'something else is using that drive', (c:\).
do you want to continue?
(y/n).
tell winblows 'y'!
then it will 'tell you' that it has to dismount the drive first, and will 'convert' on your next 'restart'.
restart?, (y/n)..., tell it 'y'!
when it reboots..., b4 your 'screen appears', it will do a 'chkdsk', and then it will convert your c:\ drive!
it took about 3 or 4 mins to do one of my '40gb wd hdd'.
when your 'desktop' comes back on, 'voila'..., and then there was &quot;ntfs!&quot; personally, i like ntfs better than fat32, (i'm an 'ol dos v3.0 guy, *started with*, and thus a diehard fat32 'fan').
it took me a long time, but 'now', it has finally convinced me!
daav =)
