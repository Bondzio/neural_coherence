notes not only the issues i noted that xp pro without latest updates may have issues with usb 2 devices or ports.
both &quot;usb 2 devices&quot; have issues without sp1 and i've seen issues with usb 2 ports working with usb 1 devices.
one workaround was to use an usb 1.1 hub inbetween.
without you give explicit details on chipsets, sp status of the xp pro and more, i must leave you to research the usb site.
