thank you bob, i have done a lot of things acording with hp suport, from reparing and reinstalling the os, last thing they suggested was to use an utility called active killdisk, i have downloaded but it wont work since is the free version and would only do a zero phase erasing, what would you suggest, do you think this will work, and is there another free utility that would do the same has killdisk???
i believe as you said that might be a problem with the grafic card it self, since eve while runing dos i have the white dots on the screen.
thanks, daniel.
