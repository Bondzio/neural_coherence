I'm just curious as to why Sony or Microsoft haven't done a thing to market their own version of an iPad?
I'm not anti-Apple but I have either Sony computers/TV's or Microsoft's Zune and their Zune Pass.
I don't want to reinvent my own personal wheel by dumping all my music and Sony cards just to buy an iPad.
Yeah, I checked the web and all I got was chatter on how &quot;companies are looking into it&quot;.
I don't want to be on Social Security before this happens.
