One had already completely crashed (failed - see below), and the other is still going, but on its last legs... (Its data is now backed up, of course). One was 5 months old, 250 giga, and the other was 18 months old, 160 giga. Thanks to a (fairly recent) backup of the 250 giga, I've still got most of the data, though some was lost. I think it's scandalous, particularly in view of the fact that the 250 giga one was my main HDD containing Win XP and all that that entails. Is this normal behaviour for Maxtor HDDs? Thanks, Chalkbel.

This is important, as closely mounted HDs tend to create a &quot;hot spot&quot; and heat in general just isn't good for any electronics. Plus, large HDs are usualy stuffed with platters and they're gettin the most out of the HD space and that can be tense as heat build-up can cause aureal drift and/or wear out the mechanicals faster due to tight tolerances. It can be one or all of these problems, but they're closely related. For the most part, I don't see a rash of Maxtors failing more than others. I do suggest you cool your system as best as possible, when you request warranty replacement, if valid still. tada -----Willy

Bob & Willy, both of these HDs are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other, so overheating looks like the problem. In that case, I can expect it to happen again if I don't take action, which I will. nerdyboy1234, I think you've reassured me as to Maxtor's durability. So I can stop looking at other makes... Thanks again, Chalkbel.
