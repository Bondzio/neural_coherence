1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if there was any utility within Windows XP , Windows Vista , or OS X to monitor overall network and/or Internet bandwidth distribution .	St
1.1.3	More specifically , which applications are using how much of my connection to download anything .	St
1.1.4	If there are n't any provided with the operating system , would there be any third-party applications ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you have only one computer and you want to determine what applications are using the most bandwidth then just load the Ethereal sniffer on that machine .	St
1.2.2	It is free and provides some bandwidth and conversation analasys tools .	St
1.2.3	If this is a shared connection then insert a hub between the DSL modem and the router .	St
1.2.4	A cheap switch will not work .	St
1.2.5	It has to be a hub or a managed switch that supports & quot ; port mirroring & quot ; .	St
1.2.6	You can use ethereal the same as before to monitor the total bandwidth being used and which applications use the most/least .	St
1.2.7	SKrall	St
1.3.1	You can use the MSFT Performance Console .	St
1.3.2	Control panel , Performance and Maint. , Admin Tools , Dbl-click Performance .	St
1.3.3	The 3 default parameters will be running .	St
1.3.4	R-click the console and select Add Counter .	St
1.3.5	Under Performance Object dropdown list , select Network Interface .	St
1.3.6	It should show all network interfaces on the right .	St
1.3.7	Scroll the list on the left to select the current bandwidth and click Add .	St
1.3.8	After you add it you can R-click it in the list of counters at the bottom and select a custom display color .	St
1.4.1	Try this little program called Bandwidth vista at http : //www.tamarsolutions.co.uk/files/bandwidthvista.zip Its free and free of junk such as adware and spyware and I think it will do the job you need done .	St
1.4.2	I use it and so does several co workers and its gotten pretty good reviews from everyone .	St
1.4.3	Hope this helps .	St
1.5.1	Opened Control Panel but where is Performance and Maint . ?	Ques
1.5.2	There is an Admin Tools but nothing in there that resembles what you indicate .	St
1.6.1	try again .	Sug
1.6.2	open control panel open administrative tools open performance click the + button open the performance object sub menu select network interface follow the directions from darton fury	St
1.7.1	That 's becaue you 're in Classic View .	St
1.7.2	You can still get to the same point .	St
1.7.3	Just open Control Panel ; then go to Administrative Tools ; then Performance .	St
1.7.4	After that , you can follow the earlier instructions .	St
1.8.1	OK to & quot ; + button & quot ; .	St
1.8.2	Click on that and I get three subs : Coumter Logs ( System ) - Trace Logs ( empty ) - Alerts ( empty ) .	St
1.8.3	Where is this & quot ; open the performance object sub menu select network interface & quot ; ?	Ques
1.9.1	Nope - tried both views , after I click on & quot ; performance & quot ; , I get system monitor and the before mentioned performance logs and alerts .	St
1.9.2	Nowhere is there a mention of ant type of net use .	St
1.10.1	Okay , try this 3rd way : Hit CTL-ALT-DEL .	St
1.10.2	Click on the Task Manager button .	St
1.10.3	Click on the Networking Tab .	St
1.10.4	This will give you a real-time track of your network utilization .	St
1.10.5	Hope this is what you need .	St
