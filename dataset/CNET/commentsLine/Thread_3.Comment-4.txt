seems pretty nice to me -- obviously you've had some grief along the way, but i'd definitely agree, if dell gave you a new laptop, they've delivered completely on any concept of warranty.
i think the suggestions above are good, but... if the reason the laptop went for repairs was a faulty hard drive, you may need more heroic measures for data recovery (which are never described as inexpensive).
i'm inferring there's useful data that aren't backed up?
if it's just your applications and configuration you want restored, you'll be quicker and better to start from scratch.
