<s> Got a general question on HD backups and viruses. </s>
<s> I have couple problems: 1) Belarc advisor has flagged my old 30GB HD as &quot;failure&quot; (although it still works for now) 2) The old P3 machine where this HD resides is plauged with a bad malware virus (about:blank / oneclicksearches.com / PSGuard). </s>
<s> I've tried cleaning the machine of this horrible virus with multiple apps, but no luck yet. </s>
<s> Fortunately I'm buying a new PC this weekend so I'm ready to get my critical files (digital photos & MS docs) off the old machine and just scrap the beast. </s>
<s> I got CD software backups for all my apps on the old PC, so I litterally only want to transfer photos & MS docs to the new machine. </s>
<s> Because my HD is on the brink of failure, backing up my critical photos & docs is the primary concern. </s>
<s> Ideally, I'd just network my old machine and new machine and conduct file transfers. </s>
<s> However I'm afraid by doing so I'll risk transferring viruses & malware to the new machine. </s>
<s> I could just burn backup CD's or buy & use an external USB HD to backup my photos & docs, but again I'm not sure if some of these viruses & adwares will 'stow away' on the CD's or ext. </s>
<s> HD, and eventually infect my brand new machine. </s>
<s> Any advice would be appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Funseeker, If you haven't done so, run McAfee's free virus scan or Trend Micro's virus scan. </s>
<s> If your machine comes back clean of viruses then you should be able to move your files to new drive OK. </s>
<s> If not, buy the software that found the virus and clean it up. </s>
<s> Then copy your files. </s>
<s> Viruses generally do not attach themselves to photo files and other data files. </s>
<s> They are typically .exe or some other type of call executable. </s>
<s> You get infested by email or the virus might be on a CD or diskette that is not a original manufacturers media. </s>
<s> Using an external HD (IMO) as backup is best as long as you keep it disconnected when not in use. </s>
<s> As far as asware/spyware goes check CNET's review of this software. </s>
<s> They haven't been wrong yet. </s>
<s> And life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> To make life easier, how about first clean up the old computer? </s>
<s> You said that you tried to clean it, but i think you should use a more extreme method: 1. download Spybot, Adaware, Microsoft Anti-spyware beta, SpySubtract (including CWShredder), and use them to do FULL-SYSTEM scan. </s>
<s> 2. get HijackThis 3. scan a HijackThis log and post it on Aumha forums ( http://forum.aumha.org/viewforum.php?f=30 ) 4. wait for reply. </s>
<s> 5. then follow the replies to clean out your computer. </s>
<s> (usually will have a lot of steps, but you have to follow them word by word, or the malicious stuff won't go. </s>
<s> recommended: after following the reply's directions, do another full system scan in Safe Mode.) </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> Thanks, I've actually spent the past 3 evenings (til the wee hours) trying to eradicate this crap off the old machine. </s>
<s> I had already started using hijack and several of the other tools before posting here. </s>
<s> I've been following along dozens of forums and tooling the net for strategies on how to clean this PC. </s>
<s> Last night I thought I took care of it, but now programs are running slow and scans are coming up with some junk again. </s>
<s> I've got a bad variant of the Smitfraud.B virus - lookout for this one, it's bad!! </s>
<s> Fortunately my ailing HD has weathered through all this so far. </s>
<s> I plan on connecting a secondary HD to the machine to drag off all my data as soon as the machine starts running right again. </s>
<s> that could work. </s>
<s> but it will still be the best not to copy the whole HD. </s>
