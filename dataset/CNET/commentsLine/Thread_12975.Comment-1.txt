hi there, i have reluctantly upgraded to vista home premium, the new computer came with it!
i have been having constant &quot;hardware&quot; bluscreen events.
my supplier has changed everything but the box, 3.5 disc reader and card reader yet this problem still occurs.
if you google &quot;bluescreen vista&quot; it seems it is a common problem, with several advertisers offering quick fixes?
microsoft will not help as it is not a problem they will admit to.
how do i make me computer reliable?
thanks and regards dunlor
