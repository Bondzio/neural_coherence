1.1.1	I had an extra parallel port put in by computer store back when I had Windows 98 .	St
1.1.2	When I had foremat and XP installed by the same store , he neglected to downlad the driver for this new port .	St
1.1.3	I was n't using the port so just disabled it .	St
1.1.4	I recently found the ITE driver and downloaded and installed it .	St
1.1.5	In device manager it shows under ports as PCI Parallel Port on LPT3 which is correct .	St
1.1.6	However it also created a new folded in device manager called , Multi-port serial adaptors and shows as a PCI multi-I/O controller .	St
1.1.7	Why is it in two places and shows differently ?	Ques
1.2.1	Because that 's how PCI controllers enumerate .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	My other parallel port is LPT1 and shows up under ports only .	St
1.4.1	Nothing seems wrong here .	St
1.4.2	PCI and USB enumerations show up in such ways .	St
1.4.3	- & gt ; Let 's try this .	St
1.4.4	What is n't working ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Just be happy it works when you need it .	St
1.5.2	Understanding the & quot ; engneering & quot ; side gets too detailed and/or the nuts/bolts that many really do n't want to know other than what I stated .	St
1.5.3	Here 's a link to explain some of it : http : //www.howstuffworks.com/category.htm ? cat=Comp Understand that alot of h/w that 's part of the mtrbd .	St
1.5.4	or basic & quot ; sold as is & quot ; system will be defaulted , thus any added h/w usually needs more attention in order for it to work .	Ques
1.5.5	The system keeps track of it and & quot ; allows & quot ; a certain range of available IRQs to represent those items .	St
1.5.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	I do appreciate your responses .	Polite
1.6.2	I tried to hook up a video camera I have but it would n't work .	St
1.6.3	However , even though I was told when I bought it that it worked with XP It does n't say that on the box .	St
1.6.4	So it is probably the camera and not the port .	St
1.7.1	But it would never work on a PCI parallel card unless I changed the PCI Parallel Card to use & quot ; classic & quot ; addresses and IRQ .	St
1.7.2	From memory the LAVA card offered such .	St
1.7.3	Read http : //www.lavalink.com/index.php ? id=474 Can I comment that lack of details hinder you getting the best help ?	Ques
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Make darn sure the camera looking at the required LPT port .	St
1.8.2	Most cameras default to LPT2 or under XP & quot ; autofind & quot ; what 's available , but that 's not a given .	St
1.8.3	If possible check the user setting under the camera s/w to determine what it is .	St
1.8.4	Since , this is LPT usage , suggests its an old camera and you maybe limited .	St
1.8.5	If all you have for camera ports to use is LPT1 or 2 , then see if the pci card or added LPTs are themselves settable .	St
1.8.6	LPT1 is already taken by the system , BTW .	St
1.8.7	If you 're using the LPT1 the std .	St
1.8.8	defaulted port for a printer , just disconnect the printer .	St
1.8.9	Reboot and then try using the camera and see if its trying to use LPT1 , then do the above to correct it for other LPT ?	Ques
1.8.10	port .	St
1.8.11	You can even disable LPT via the bios to deal only with the added pci card and see where that takes you , of course testing or connecting as required .	St
1.8.12	On top of all that make sure the LPT port is set to STD or plain LPT , not EPP or EPS ( I think ) .	St
1.8.13	Just another area to check .	St
1.8.14	This is about all I can suggest for now .	St
1.8.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	Thank it 's looking at LPT3 .	St
1.9.2	Having camera is not important to me .	St
1.9.3	As mentioned , I 'm not sure it will work with XP .	St
1.10.1	Can I comment that if I knew what details to post , I would n't need to come here ?	Ques
1.11.1	The make and model numbers would help too .	St
1.11.2	I really do want to see you succeed .	St
1.11.3	But you have to tell more than what you have .	St
1.11.4	Some think the forum members will ask for detail by detail , but this is not tech support so you must make it as easy and be nice as possible .	St
1.11.5	Cheers , Bob	St
