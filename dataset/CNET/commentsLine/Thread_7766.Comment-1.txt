we have many ct/mri etc.
machines and servers in the hospital lan.
now intermittently we are loosing the lan connectivity i.e we are not able to ping any system from any node inside the hospital network for sometimes, after some time it will start working and then again it will stops again.we are using procurve switches and also we are not using any router.
can anybody suggest me what is the problem?
