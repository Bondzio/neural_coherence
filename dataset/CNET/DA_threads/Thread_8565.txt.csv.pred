1.1.1	AMD Athlon 64 3700+ , 939pin , San Diego , 90nm Shuttle SN25P ( 350 watt psu , nvidia 4ultra mobo ) CORSAIR ValueSelect 2x512 DDR400 PC 3200 Seagate Barracuda 80GB Sata150 Powercolor Radeon X850XTPE , PCI-E PLextor PX-740A DVD Burner Sony Floppy Drive First off will the 350 watts be enough ?	Ques
1.1.2	Second the mobo has sata but will it be compatible with 150 ?	Ques
1.1.3	Next what is the best gcard at about $ 250 as I think the x850 will most likely be overkill .	St
1.1.4	And lastly does the system components seem to be compatible ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank you all for your help .	St
1.2.1	i would suggest getting a nvidia card .	St
1.2.2	a nvidia card within your price range would be the 6800 .	St
1.3.1	Do n't you mean 6800GT , 6800Ultra , or perhaps 7800GTX .	St
1.3.2	REcommend ocz psu if you can afford .	St
1.3.3	If not , Rosewill RP550 ATX 550W Power Supply-57 at newegg.com ROger	St
1.4.1	he has a shuttle that power supply will do fine as sff psus are very powerful despite their wattage and size .	St
1.4.2	look around sfftech .	St
1.4.3	agreed with the dif gpu konny	St
1.5.1	Oh , i see now , he ordered a shuttle barebone .	St
1.5.2	O.o .	St
1.5.3	THe X850 will be fine in that with the 350watt psu , as the wattage is more than enough .	St
1.5.4	Make sure the card will fit , that 's the only comment i have to make .	St
1.5.5	Roger	St
1.6.1	The PSU is good enough because m-ATX boards do n't consume a lot of power .	St
1.6.2	SATA 150 is definately supported but you may be thinking of sata 300 .	St
1.6.3	That I do n't know , maybe not .	Res
1.6.4	Everything seems to be compatable except maybe the video card and chipset .	St
1.6.5	Now I maybe wrong , but I do n't know if mixing ATI nvidia is ok. Also , your card is a two slotter .	St
1.6.6	Try this : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814122224 Hope this helps !	St
