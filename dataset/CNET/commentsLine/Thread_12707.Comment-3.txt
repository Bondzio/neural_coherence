resetting his connection would be was my first step, but he is out the city till middle march and i just cannot wait that long.
couple notes - if another laptop worked - can i do something to my laptop to make it work again?
such as change that ip address manually?
- i'm just guessing, if you can really change ip address manually - please guide me on how to do it.
and the last thing - as i mentioned i've erased and reformatted all drives- and i got the same message in the middle of windows installation.
in the middle!
meaning i didn't even do any set up or search for any wireless connections.
can that be a conflict within my computer, like my wireless card is conflicting with ethernet network card (just guessing again)?
