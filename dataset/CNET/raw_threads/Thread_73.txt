8979	0	35362	409077	NR	wanderlei	9/1/04 10:27 PM	1.09407762E12	Problem with new hardware	Here's the new hardware I bought: nforce2 ultra 400 ga-7n400-L mobo xp 3000+/400 barton geforce fx5900 xt 4 sticks of 256mb pc-3200 viking When I boot up nothing happens. It's like the video card isn't even there. When i replace the mobo with my old one, it works (sort of). What I think is happening is that the video card is set to 2x agp and the mobo doesn't support 2x. But i cant see the bios so i cant set it to 4x. Thats the big problem, another is when i replace the new mobo with the old one i can boot into windows but it will only recognize 128mb of ram. Which is really strange because i have 4 256mb sticks in it. thx for help guys
