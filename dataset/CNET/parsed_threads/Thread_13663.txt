<s> I'm sure it's been asked before, but I am still curious. </s>
<s> Which do you think is better the big name brands, or something generic (concerning cabling)? </s>
<s> I've been looking in the retail stores, and their cabling is expensive, especially Monster and Belkin stuff. </s>
<s> I come online and can find dirt cheap cables. </s>
<s> Is there any difference in the cables? </s>
<s> Trust me, I'm not stalking you or anything. </s>
<s> Hope my other comment was useful. </s>
<s> As far as my knowledge goes, there is no difference between name brands and the generic stuff. </s>
<s> I know that hdmi cables are all held to a certain standard and therefore they are all of technical equal quality. </s>
<s> I think you pay more for the name brands simply because they are recognizable. </s>
<s> They also look pretty nice. </s>
<s> That being said, I never buy Monster cables. </s>
<s> They are so overpriced. </s>
<s> I have to give a shout out to www.tendonusa.com again. </s>
<s> Those guys treat me right. </s>
<s> Their cables look great, they have a lifetime warranty (just like monster), and they are cheap! </s>
<s> What's better than that? </s>
<s> Quality matters and thus any decent namebrand will stand behind thier product. </s>
<s> While generic brands do deliver but there is less desirable products offered and there's no way to tell the difference until failure. </s>
<s> You can buy with confidence any namebrand product overall. </s>
<s> My experience with generic brands is pretty much OK, but those that failed I had no one to turn to for warranty replacement and/or recourse since they failed long after some period that any store would stand behind them plus no &quot;sales receipt&quot; by that time, figures. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> many low- to mid-priced Cat-5 and USB cables over the years, and have had no problems not attributable to abuse (like someone pulling on it or kinking it). </s>
<s> I never buy the expensive ones if I can help it. </s>
