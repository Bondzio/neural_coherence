And the caveat is this.
Since you noted &quot;XP&quot; you must keep the boot partition under 127GB in size.
I will NOT duplicate why this is but offer this link -&gt; http://www.48bitlba.com Next it's a snap to clone your 10GB to the new drive with the free software that comes with your drive, downloaded from your drives maker or even G4U copydisk (see google.)
&quot;Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software?&quot; The software I noted so far is not special.
