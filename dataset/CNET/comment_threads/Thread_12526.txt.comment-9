the fact that it's VIA makes it undesireable for performance tweaking (VIA is horrible for overclocking and performance tweaking, as they are a value centered brand) and thank you for providing the exact chipset that does this (i knew it was a VIA chip that did AGP/PCIE, but did not know which one it was (or which platform it was for (AMD or Intel) just that it existed)
