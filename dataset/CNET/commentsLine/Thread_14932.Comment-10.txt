but i did read your post.
here it is -&gt; i am having the exact same problem with the same router.
no matter what security setup i have played with, i haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me.
this wasn't too big of an issue until i hooked up my new ps3.
it drops connection about every other match.
i have been debating just buying a new router even though i can't afford it.
i've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one.
i'm even up to date on the firmware.
not a word about wired, wifi or settings.
no make, model, firmware version.
the forum sticky does cover the firmware issue but without the details you may only get &quot;check the forum sticky.&quot; bob
