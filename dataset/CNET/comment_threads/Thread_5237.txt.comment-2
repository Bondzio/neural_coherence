I've used these USB powered drives and after 2 of my own and dozens at the office I can share that they are finicky.
You'll find they work only on some machines, some but not all USB 2.0 ports and the cure is to get a power supply for the unit.
I've had some luck with a 2 to 1 USB cable where it connects to 2 laptop USB ports to eek a little more power.
One of my units uses what I thought at first was a standard A-B USB cable.
But later I figured out that it's cable was &quot;special.&quot; How?
The wires that carry power were double the normal thickness.
Nothing's busted here except your device does not work on all setups.
Here's the cable I would try -&gt; Read paragraph 4 at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Power Bob
