1.1.1	Which one 's would you recommend for rendering and image editing duties ?	Ques
1.1.2	I usually have Cinema 4D and Terragen rendering at the same time along with Photoshop and Paintshop Pro running along side each other .	St
1.1.3	Not to mention WMP playing music 24/7 ... My Dell is almost always running at 100 % and sometimes does not respond for hours on end .	St
1.1.4	I need a PC that can handle all this , but still come at a price under $ 1600 with a good sized hard drive and efficient memory ... thanks	St
1.2.1	emachines ! ! !	St
1.2.2	!	St
1.3.1	Thank you .	St
1.3.2	Nice and expandable .	St
1.3.3	Anymore recommendations ?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	If you 're going to do all that rendering at the SAME time , then you should get a new Pentium EE .	St
1.5.2	Do n't know if you can do that in your budget though , as the procesoor alone costs $ 1000 .	St
1.5.3	However , doing perhaps 2 of those applications and wmp would be pretty okay on the emachines t6212 .	St
1.5.4	If you 're going to do all 4 , i do n't really know .	St
1.5.5	I do n't think AMD athlon 64s were built to multitask , but depending on how olds you dell it would still probably be faster .	St
1.6.1	i have no clue why i recommended the emachines in the first place .	St
1.6.2	It is a total budget pc , and you 're willing to spend $ 1600 .	St
1.6.3	Go with a custom computer either made by Monarch , Cyberpower , ibuypower , velocity micro , overdrive , alienware , falcon northwest , voodoo or many others/ build your own .	St
1.6.4	If you have no clue about buildigny our own or do not like the reputations of those companies and want an oem .	St
1.6.5	Go for the Dell 9100 with a Pentium D. Should be within your budget and be good for multitasking .	St
1.7.1	a Pentium EE is just a Pentium Extreme Edition which means either the Pentium 4 EE or Pentium D EE , which just feature more cache , and in the D EE 's case HT ( while normal Pentium D 's do n't have HT ) Athlon64 would be perfectly fine for your needs but i 'd still suggest the Intel Pentium D 820 , it 's 2 2.8GHZ cores in addition i 'd say throw a 250GB hard drive , 2GB of DDR2 PC 5400 , and what ever you need for graphics ( depending on the level of rendering your doing and so on )	St
1.8.1	I 've recently stumbled upon ABS computers , and would ABS ' Ultimate V2 ( here : http : //www.abspc.com/app/config.asp ? mono=1892 ) suit my needs in your opinions ?	Ques
1.8.2	Thank you all for your advice , you 've all been helpful .	St
1.9.1	That is just an ordinary run of the mill computer that can be had with just about any maker of PC 's for that price range , and IMO is not the one for you .	St
1.9.2	It has the 754 Socket motherboard which is being phased out in favor of the 939 socket , 80GB hard drive ( you need more ) , 512MB RAM ( you could use more..like 1GB ) , and a low end $ 45- $ 50 Video Card .	St
1.9.3	Since you have so much rendering and running at the same time , IMO you need just what Ozos suggested , a computer with the new DUAL-CORE processor .	St
1.9.4	Here is what another guy ( Ksoiehawo ) is planning to build with the Dual-Core Processor & motherboard : His post in the PC Hardware Forum http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=110914 & messageID=1262200 All prices are from Newegg : Case : $ 125 Antec Performance TX1050B /w Antec Smartpower 500W Power Supply Motherboard : $ 224 Asus P5WD2 CPU : $ 363.99 Intel Pentium D 830 RAM : $ 89 ( DDR-2 , 533 PC4200 ) Corsair Value Select PC4200 1024MB ( 2x512MB ) Video Card : $ 166 ( or the Gigabyte 6600 PCIe @ $ 107 ) Gigabyte 6600GT ( PCIe ) HDD : $ 112 Seagate 200GB SATA FDD : Mitsumi 7-in-1 ( Mitsumi 8-in-1 card reader w/floppy $ 20 ) DVD Burner : $ 36.99 BenQ 1620 DVD ROM : $ 33 BenQ 1650 Sub total at Newegg purchase $ 1149.98 + shipping Would also need a Operating System Win XP Home w/SP2 $ 83.95 And if you do not already have , add : Speakers..inexpensive ( $ 20+ A 56kbps Modem ( aprx $ 10- $ 20 ) A Router ( aprx $ 15- $ 25 ) An inexpensive keyboard & mouse .
