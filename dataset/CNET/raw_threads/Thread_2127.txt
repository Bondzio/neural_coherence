My computer does not see it at all. But when I go into command prompt,diskpart,disk list. It comes up. when i try to clean it i get a parameter error. Does anyone have any idea on how to fix it

Try another USB-port (front in stead of back or the other way around), another cable, no hub or active hub or passive hub). There's a good chance one possible combination will work. But first use another machine to format the drive again and see if it works there. Kees
