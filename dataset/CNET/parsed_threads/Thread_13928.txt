<s> Hi, I'll be relocating to Germany and of course will take all my computer stuff with me.I understand, that monitors and computers with a switch in the back can run with 220 - 240 V. If anybody out there has a suggestion what to do , that scanners, printers etc. </s>
<s> can also be modified to run with 220 - 240 V please let me know.What do I do about the charger for my notebook ? </s>
<s> I understand that converters are out there. </s>
<s> Would that be the only option ? </s>
<s> Thanks, Gryta </s>
<s> My printer notes operation from 100 to 240 VAC and 50 to 60 Cycles. </s>
<s> This is known as a &quot;free voltage&quot; design and will need nothing more than an plug adapter. </s>

<s> It's NOT the voltage differences between American and European electricity you need to worry about. </s>
<s> ANYTHING between 95 and 130 VAC (Volts Alternating Current) is considered standard wall socket and lighting voltage nearly world wide. </s>
<s> Likewise 190 to 250 VAC is standard large appliance voltage with two phase motors or heating elements to power. </s>
<s> I'd hate to think what would happen if you actually pluged your charger into a 220V outlet intended for heaters and dryers and such!!! </s>
<s> It's the ALTERNATING FREQUENCY that can mess up some small appliances and electronic devices. </s>
<s> The US and Canada supply house voltages at 60 Hertz, where European electricity measures 50 Hertz. </s>
<s> For most wall adapters (unless engineered to compensate for lower frequencies) deliver a reduced charging voltage as a result of the different rate. </s>
<s> On the other hand, European chargers, designed for 50 hertz, plugged into American electricity will produce HIGHER voltages. </s>
<s> In some cases, a low operating voltage in some electronics can be just as damaging as too high a voltage. </s>
<s> MOST electronic devices have a tag or label around the power cord that will state the input range, i.e., 100 ~ 125 VAC / 50 - 60 Hz. </s>
<s> A tag like (that includes both 50 and 60 hertz rates) means it's safe to plug in just about anywhere in the world. </s>
<s> This may seem like the silliest question ever, but it can be applicable to many appliances. </s>
<s> I'm trying to buy an American iron (Austrian ones leave much to be desired), but all that I look at say only 120V, so I haven't purchased one. </s>
<s> However, am I looking at the wrong part of the tag? </s>
<s> I only want to use an adaptor, not converter, should I be checking for 60 HZ instead? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> your info regatrding voltage levels around the world??? </s>
<s> Simply do a google search for &quot;country voltages&quot; and you may find that your info is incorrect. </s>
<s> Also regarding the difference between 50 HZ and 60 HZ, while for devices with iron/ferrite cores the transformer losses vary somewhat, there are very few things for which it makes a failure condition. </s>
<s> Yes I know that many years ago when California went from 50 HZ to 60 HZ, they saved enough in power meter losses to pay for the conversion. </s>
