&quot;how to install the dvd player (for windows 98) windows 98 has an internal dvd player, but it isn't installed during windows setup.
you must extract &quot;manually&quot; dvd player files from cab sources.
those files are dvdplay.chm, dvdplay.cnt, dvdplay.hlp, dvdplay.exe and dvdrgn.exe.
put them into a folder of your choice, and them move dvdrgn.exe into windows folder.
run dvdplay.exe to start the player.
&quot; - noted widely on the web.
but this player is incapable of playing 99% of commercial dvds.
i've found this tip to be useful for playback in a pinch for homemade dvds.
