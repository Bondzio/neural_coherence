<s> Okay, so I was trying yo figure out a way to split my Maxtor One-Touch 500 GB hard drive so I could format each half a different form. </s>
<s> I'm running on a Compaq Presario XP. </s>
<s> I right-clicked on My Computer, selected manage, and chose disk management over in the sidebar. </s>
<s> I saw my drive (under D:) and right clicked it. </s>
<s> I chose delete partition so then I could, I don't know, I thought it would help me. </s>
<s> But, now my Ex. </s>
<s> hard drive isn't being detected under My Computer, so I can't access it. </s>
<s> When I plug it in it still makes the doo-duh sound. </s>
<s> The drive is still installed AND working (or at least it said it was). </s>
<s> The power cable is working fine, the light stays on. </s>
<s> I've tried many usb cables and that isn't the problem. </s>
<s> I've even tried other computers and they all did the same thing (after installing the drive). </s>
<s> I'm really needing help. </s>
<s> Thanks for looking and I hope I explained enough. </s>
<s> And since there is no partitions there is nothing that should show in Explorer. </s>
<s> Go back the disk management and create a partition and then format that. </s>
<s> After that, you should be good. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There was no place to create a new partition and format, but I found out what to do. </s>
<s> I'll post that so that if anyone else runs into this problem, they can be helped. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Download the Maxtor Maxblast program at http://www.seagate.com/support/maxblast/MaxBlastSetup.en.exe 2. </s>
<s> Make sure your ex hard drive is plugged in 3. </s>
<s> Run the program 4. </s>
<s> It will come up with a message saying, &quot;A blank disc has been found. </s>
<s> Do you want to prepare the disc for data and, if necessary, copy your files onto it? </s>
<s> Click NO to skip these steps and keep the disc as is.&quot; 5. </s>
<s> Slect Yes (of course) 6. </s>
<s> Click next two times, then make sure the &quot;Create new partition in unallocated space&quot; is checke. </s>
<s> 7.Then click next seven more times (unless you want to change any of those setting) and choose proceed. </s>
<s> It will do the process and in the end saying &quot;New disc was successfully added.&quot; </s>
<s> Many don't want to use the native tools so your method is good too. </s>
