<s> Hi I am a bit confused with whats going on with my Router Signal. </s>
<s> I previously had a Linksys WRT54G, before I upgraded to my new router I was getting quite good signals and my internet speed on my pc was ranging from 3.7 - 4.5 Mbps. </s>
<s> After upgrading to a Cisco Linksys E4200 based on the great Cnet ratings, my internet speed has plumetted to a range of 2.5 - 3.1 Mbps and the Signal Strength on my wireless connection has gone to &quot;Very Low&quot; I have checked the channels of the surrounding routers (using a software called network stumbler ). </s>
<s> I am using channel 1 which is not being used by anyone else. </s>
<s> I am just surprised, I thought my speed and connection strength would sky rocket after getting such a good router. </s>
<s> Anyone got any idea what I may be doing wrong? </s>
<s> I don't see enough detail to dig into it. </s>
<s> It could be out of date firmware or some combination of MAC filtering and hiding the SSID but those details are not here. </s>
<s> Try telling more and be sure to try it the simple way with current firmware, SSID broadcasting, router defaults and WPA2 AES personal security. </s>

<s> If this has 802.11n enabled, try channel 3. </s>
<s> Just in case. </s>
<s> However here I let my router pick the channel. </s>
<s> It saves me from checking into this setting ever again. </s>
<s> Call me lazy, I don't like to fiddle with the router. </s>

<s> Hi R.Proffitt thanks for the reply Please find further details below: Current Firmware: 1.0.04 this is up to dateMAC Filtering: Disabled SSID Broadcasting: Enabled Security Mode : WPA2/WPA Mixed mode Channel: Auto, (Network Stumbler software shows channel 1 was used) IPv6 SPI Firewall Protection:Enabled IPv4 SPI Firewall Protection: Enabled </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Just WPA2. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Without the firewall. </s>
<s> NAT is a firewall since there will be no inbound connections that can make it to your machine unsolicited. </s>
<s> It can cause slowdowns in some routers. </s>
<s> Some folk dig in their heels on item 2. </s>
<s> It's understandable but then again, NAT is a firewall too. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I have removed the firewall 2. </s>
<s> I have not changes the WPA2/WPA to just WPA2 because one of my wireless cards doesnn't connect if it's just WPA2. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I have moved a small obsturction out of the routers way. </s>
<s> I am now getting a bit better internet speed. </s>
<s> just as a comparison, if I am sitting next to the router the speed of the internet is above 20Mbps, but in a room upstairs (router is downstairs) I am now getting about 3.5 Mbps, so ideally I would like to get up to atleast 10 Mbps is the upstairs room. </s>
<s> WPA only? </s>
<s> There's no reason to use WPA2 if this is in mixed mode. </s>
<s> Also, how about a channel check? </s>
<s> What channel is this on? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for that Bob Much better now Signal Strength Good Internet Speed 4Mbps-5Mbps Settings changed: 1. </s>
<s> WPA Only instead of WPA2/WPA 2. </s>
<s> Channel 3 instead of Default 1 </s>
<s> For the channel, if you are sure the region is set properly, then automatic is fine. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-13973_102-560420/wifi-disconnects-from-time-to-time-galaxy-tab-7-plus/?tag=contentBody;threadListing to see where the region matters. </s>
<s> On a personal comment, I hope these makers start offering some reduced options where they offer the things that have issues in some expert menus. </s>
