One of my hard drives is failing - diagnostic tests came up with message error code 7.
It's Dell and the warranty expired last month (why am I not surprised).
Anyway, I've got two hard drives and one is working properly.
My question is, can I separate the two and reinstall windows on just the one working disk?
I don't want to spend money on a new disk plus the fee for the technician to come install it(this is the second time a disk has failed) for this computer and I don't really want to buy a new computer yet.
I'd prefer not to have to open the case and manually removing the offending disk as I'm not very tech savvy at all and may do more damage but if that's the only way... Or can anyone suggest something else?
Funny thing is, the failing disk is seated in the same position as the one that failed before.
