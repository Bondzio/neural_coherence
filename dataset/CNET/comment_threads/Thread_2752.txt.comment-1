Just wondering.
With all the hype of Win7 being released at the end of 2009, what's the scoop on upgrading PCs to take advantage of the new technology?
Does anyone know if you can just upgrade / buy a new monitor, will you need a new monitor AND another interface card you can plug into your PC, or will you have to get an entirely new system altogether if you want to be touchy-feely?
The technology's so new that I haven't found a lot of info online about the specific monitors yet.
