If I choose to use this ram, will I experience any lags, assuming I have an AMD 4400 x2, and a 7800 gt oc. Thanks in advance for trying to help

Using a mem tester I find that I can config this mem to 2,2,3 and it runs fine. I've run mem benchmarks both ways and darned if I can see a diff.

673	6	153289	1706550	1706356	ikjadoon	1/29/06 6:00 PM	1.1385576E12	Yup	But I think only benchmarks and maybe a gain of 5-10FPS maximum is the difference you might get from the bottom of the barrell to the top. ~Ibrahim~
