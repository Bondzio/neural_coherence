Your post sounded as if you were going to write code, drivers to make this all happen.
At no point was Windows listed in your top post so I thought, hey, that old idea.
These ideas were kicked around for years but as disk space costs dropped, the idea went with it.
You seem to want to try it again so why not?
In other words, you'll have to create it.
