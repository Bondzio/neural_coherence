since you have your ssd installed has it lived up to your expectations?
does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std.
hd?
since, these have been out for some time and early problems resolved(i think) just are your thoughts on that?
i like to exclude any costs here, just your real pc experiences.
