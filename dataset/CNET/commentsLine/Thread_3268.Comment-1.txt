hi everyone - i am hoping i don't have a unique problem but i feel that i do.
here is my situation.
i had been running a linksys wrt54g as a router on my home network.
included on that network i also was running several panasonic bl-c130(1) ip cameras so i could keep an eye on things while at work.
well i outgrew the linkysys, was having some slowness issues so i purchased a new netgear wndr 3700 router, great router very fast compared to my linksys.
so here is where the problem comes in.
the panasonic cameras only support wep encryption or no encryption which is not really an good option.
my netgear router does not support wep.
so i have been trying to setup both routers on my single internet connection, using the linksys solely for the cameras.
i've tried chaining the routers together (internet to the netgear internet port - cable from netgear port to linksys internet connection as well as lan port), making sure the wireless channels are not overlapping, turning off dhcp on the linksys, turning off wep encryption on the linksys (again not a good option), etc.
still not working.
so i am wondering if i am over-thinking this.
can i just take the internet connection from my cable modem, send it through a small switch and then 1 cable to the netgear internent connection and 1 cable to my linksys internet connection??
essentially running 2 seperate routers/networks off a single cable modem connection.
if not, i've been looking into changing the firmware on the linksys with dd-wrt or other similar 3rd party firmware.
thanks in advance for any and all help.
