Just lately when I shut the machine down completely at night I get &quot;Program not responding&quot;. That seems to only happen at night afer the unit has been on all day. If I shut everything down after its only been on for a few hours it works just fine. Sound familiar...and what should I do?? Many thanks Mil

If you press Ctrl/Alt/Del keys at the same time it should bring up the Task Manager which may show you which program isn't responding. Tufenuf

I pulled the HDD first/added a MAXTOR 120-GB DiamondMAX[NTFS]File System..added a second RAM Chip for 512MBs of RAM..and the Microsoft CD came out for SP2..so my Home Edition was raised to SP2..how-ever..I also added the XP-Professional Upgrade CD(SP2)..and this is where I began to develop &quot;complications&quot;.. .. So..for a DELL Dimension 2350 I would suggest the latest SP2 XP Full Version Operating System..no Upgrades or SP2 CDs.. Then 512 MBs of RAM..that Motherboard runs really slow RAM(133MHz)if my memory serves me..that's a problem in these times with HUGE Updateing Services..My Updates have DOUBLED in 6-years.. .. So your running all day with a Shut-Down Problem.. I suggest you slow down on Shutting Down.. First..getting to the DeskTop..Signing Off the Internet.. Use the DISK CLEAN UP Program..but wait about 30-seconds before CLicking the ICON(shortcut)..let it RUN..get back to the DeskTop..Click the START-Menu..Click...TURN-OFF Computer..now wait until the DeskTOP darkens before Clicking TURN-OFF COMPUTER..and that should work..otherwise/yes some Device is still running..because of your Hardware Acceleration..the PC can't handle the needs of the programs and hardware..its time to drop some things.. Like a Digital Sound Card(return)to your Integrated Sound Card.. Remove Video Software..your PC is obsolete for VIDEO..and even DVD-ROM..if you had upgraded to DVD-ROM..you might want to put the CR-ROM and CDRW back in the machine.. .. This was a solution to some of my problems.. My DELL Dimension 2350 was upgraded to a newer Motherboard and Processor and faster RAM.. But I purchased a DELL 1100-series DE051..that had numorious problems because of Hardware Acceleration-due to the DVD Drives..and VIDEO applications..also DELL delivered a machine with the wrong RAM Module..once that was replaced/I pulled the Drives and used the old Dimension CD Drives and used the DE051 DVD Drives in the Upgraded 2350..in the DE051 I dropped the Hardware Acceleration-one notch..viola'..one spectacular Internet PC.. .. If your DELL Dimension 2350 is all original..I can almost assure you its obsolete..but would suggest you just slow down on Shut-Downs..let your DESKTOP---darken..and then CLICK---Turn OFF.

I run win xp, ECS 939pin mb, AMD Athlon 64x2 3800+, 1 Gig mem, I get the following (card reader lookup window) I have to end process before I can shutdown. Also the comp just came back from repair; I notified them they were no help. As I did have an EVGA mb 939pin that was better than the one they replaced it with, that went bad after only 10 months. I am not satisfied with the work they did. I got the unit back, they said they tested it, the hd power cable was off & the hd's were switched. How could they have tested it? Sorry just venting. Any help would be great. Than you MIke.

If you click on Safely Remove Hardware before exiting (& select said memory card/stick), it'll go away. I suspect that whether or not the memory card/stick is in place when you turn on the computer has a bearing on this. I'm amused by this because I thought it was something to do with the Card Reader software (very old DOS program) which I continued to use until very recently as I had a load of contact details which only it could read. I haven't used it for 3 months so I was amazed to keep getting this message - anyway, I think I understand now. It's just another example of Micosoft's incompetence.

If I remove a memory card prior to shut down then MS will hang up at shut down. It wants to save the files even though they are no longer open. I don't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or USB models for SD cards, just when I use the slots in the Brother Printer. Given that you probably would catch on to that error, I would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software.
