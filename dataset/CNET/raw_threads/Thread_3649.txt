After having CRT's all my life I am finally ready to take the step up to and LCD, but now I have to decide which one! I am trying to choose between a 19'' Viewsonic and a 20.1'' Samsung. At first I was going to go with the Viewsonic, but found that the inch larger Samsung is only $30 more after the rebate. I plan on using the monitor with an ATI Radeon 1900XTX, so the graphics card should be an issue. I will be using it mostly for playing games, watching a few DVDs and some CAD work. Both monitors have received very good reviews, the only complaint people seem to have about the Samsung is that the viewing angle isnt the greatest, but I spend most of my time directly in front of the screen. Is it worth paying $30 more for a slightly larger monitor with a higher native resolution? Has anyone used either one of these monitors? Let me know your thoughts, below are the specs for both monitors. 19 ViewSonic VX922 Specifications Cabinet Color

Since the size difference is so small, a 19&quot; at 1280x1024 may give you a better gaming experience since you should be able to use a higher AA/AF setting and get higher frame rates in tough games. Depending on your eyesight, you might find the 19&quot; easier to read also. 8pt type will be much smaller on the 20&quot;. Conversely, if you have excellent vision, you may appreciate the higher res of the 20&quot; in your CAD apps. As for viewing angle and general &quot;performance&quot;, I find that a personal choice. You should demo each monitor to see how they look to you and if you can notice/tolerate any deficiencies.

Viewsonic is an okay okay brand... Samsung on the other hand makes some great LCD's. One other thing, don't ever get widescreen LCD... the vertical distance is just too small... you're better off with dual 4:3 monitors.
13537	3	198597	2133860	2133705	TheyCallMeGeorge	8/15/06 8:36 AM	1.15563096E12	Go with the Samsung	I would go ahead and buy the 20.1&quot; monitor. It sounds like an excellent monitor, and for $30, there's really no reason not to go for it. The higher resolution will definitely be worth the extra money, and if you choose not to use that resolution, I'm sure that that particular monitor will be able to scale down the resolution to something a little lower. Most modern quality LCDs can do that these days. However, if you choose to get a 19&quot; monitor, and save a little money, I would highly recommend the Dell 1907FP monitor. You can get it for $247 (purchase a $15 off coupon on eBay to make the price even better) with free shipping. It got a much better review than the Viewsonic as well (7.5 rating vs. 6.4 rating). If you have the money, I would even recommend getting dual 1907FPs over a single 20.1&quot; monitor. But I'll leave that decision up to you. Good luck!

Depending on your eyesight, you may prefer the bigger text on the 19&quot;. I couldn't live with the tiny text on the 20&quot; at native resolution. As another poster said, some LCDs now perform reasonably at lower resolutions but not all do. Fuzzy edges at lower than native resolution can be really irritating. The technical specs of the Samsung are slightly better (except for the response time). LCDs, unlike CRTs, do have more of a &quot;personality&quot; to them, so it is even more important that you don't simply choose by specification but go and sit in front of each one in your local PC store for 15-20 minutes. A very personal choice - good luck.

When I purchased it was 299 now at zip zoom fly it's 271, and by the way I love it's performance.

The Viewsonic has a 2 MilliSecond response time versus the 5MS for the Samsung. What that will affect is how fast your gaming scenes change and, even though anything below 8MS is supposedly acceptable, the Viewsonic will be faster. Second, is a note that using a resolution other than the native one on an LCD results in a marked decrease in the clarity of the screen. Unlike a picture tube, an LCD is a gazillion, fixed, pixels. I have very good eyesight and the 1600x1200 Samsung display would not bother me a bit; but, the 1280x1024 on the Viewsonic will result in physically larger text and icons, even though the display is slightly smaller. I would suggest that you go to BestBuy, Office Depot, or Circuit City to do an eyes on evaluation of the difference in resolutions, especially.

It replaced a 21&quot;NEC and it actually has a little bit bigger screen. It runs native 1600x1200 and I haven't had any problem in games. I play a lot of online FPS games and it works great. The only caution is I'm not able to use the magic swivel program that comes with the monitor because its not compatible with my 7900GTKO512 video card. But thats the software not the monitor. The monitor is amazing and I highly recommend it. I got it for $285 and couldn't be happier.

Returned them. Eneded up purchasing a Samsung Syncmaster 930B (19&quot;) from NewEgg.com. It's beautiful with no stuck/dead pixels. These days I really like Samsung and Acer for LCD's. I have never received one of their models with bad pixels, the picture is great, and they both have really nice, clean looking panels.

The resolution is 1280 x 1024. I do graphic design work and it is absolutely great. No lost pixels at all. The Acer was on sale for $219, which was $40 less than anywhere else I could find it. Very pleased with it, and no side angle distortion. http://www.questgraphicsdesign.com

Another poster suggested a Dell 1907, which is a beautiful monitor, but has a slightly sluggish response time. It should be noted that Samsung manufacturers Dell flat panels (most of them), so the quality of the Samsung will really shine. As for the 8ms on the Samsung vs the 2ms on the ViewSonic, well, let's just say I highly doubt ViewSonic's claims there. That's ridiculously fast and therefore probably only attainable with specific settings and connections. Bottom line: Go with the 20.1&quot; Samsung. You'll be glad you did.

It is now the number five LCD screen we have (20 in Dell, 20 in Sceptre, 17 in KDS, 15 in Apple) but it still has an excellent picture after four years of hard use. The Sceptre and Dell have the best pictures and features, but the Sceptre has been a nightmare to keep operational. You can find the Dell on special about once a quarter, but not for what you can get that Samsung for. Go for it.
