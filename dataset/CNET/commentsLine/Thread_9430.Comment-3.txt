bill, thanks for your explanation.
it taught me enough that i was able to do a helpful search.
mdnsresponder provides bonjour service usnig udp port 53. when that doesn't answer, it uses a random port to offer the service.
since that application is reading port 53, it is safe to open it.
now i've done that and the message is gone.
