<s> I recently purchased the Netgear MA111 wireless adapter, as well as Netgear's wireless router. </s>
<s> The router works fine w/ the computer when the computer was plugged into it via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> However, when I try to access the internet w/ the USB adapter only, it does not work. </s>
<s> I spoke with Netgear's tech support and we ran ipconfig which seemed to indicate the existence of the internet. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I could not access any site including the config site for the router. </s>
<s> Also, I am running Windows 98SE. </s>
<s> Thanks, Corey </s>
<s> If the product is non-functional, it may be best to pack it up and try another product. </s>
<s> You may have issues with USB or didn't follow their install notes. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com has many posts where the USB devices are plugged in before the drivers or the motherboard drivers are not installed and USB problems (just like yours) begin. </s>
<s> I read no mention of details on your part about removal of the Ethernet card, setting the mode of the USB Wifi and more. </s>
<s> This lack of information leads me to think that returning the product will save you a lot of work. </s>

<s> The ethernet card is integrated in the laptop. </s>
<s> I am not sure how I would remove it. </s>
<s> I did install the driver prior to inserting the adapter. </s>
<s> Based on this information, do you think it is still more likely that the product is defective? </s>
<s> Is this a common occurrence? </s>
<s> Thanks, Corey </s>
<s> You can use the Device Manager to disable the network card so Windows won't try to remember it and use it instead of the WiFi card. </s>
<s> The product is indeed defective if the instructions didn't work for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Good luck getting any help with Netgear's 3rd World support people or the &quot;slim&quot; documention that comes with their products. </s>
<s> That said, I got my Netgear system up and running in 2 days mostly by myself. </s>
<s> I'm not familar with the USB wireless unit that you're using with your laptop. </s>
<s> I'm running the WG511 PC card and it works fine. </s>
<s> Perhaps you should go that route instead. </s>
<s> I hear the problems don't exist with the PC card, and I may return my USB adapter for the PC card one. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for a quick fix to get it to work? </s>
<s> There must be some reason - albeit minorly complicated and laborious - involving configuration. </s>
<s> AND I know the adapter works - I tried it on an XP laptop </s>
