just the other day i had to restart my computer after a crash while watching a movie.
i had to use the power button, since ctrl-alt-del didn't work.
when the computer booted up again, strange noises came from the harddrive, almost sounded like some sort of sci-fi raygun.
i've never encountered that one before, so i was wondering if anyone had any advise for me on what to do?
send it for repairs, hum along with the noise, or ignore it?
or something?
