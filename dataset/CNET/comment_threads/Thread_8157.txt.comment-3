SO even though I play all of my music in Itunes anyway (with playlists) if the music is not in the itunes folder it will not copy over to the ipod automatically.
Is that correct?
And if it is then it sounds like the quickest solution is to open itunes and add the filles back into it again except this time make sure the option &quot;copy into itunes folder when adding to the library&quot; is checked in the advanced settings.
Is this correct?
Thanks for the help
