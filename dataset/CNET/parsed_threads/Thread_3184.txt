<s> I have purchased the above LCD monitor. </s>
<s> The display is flawless. </s>
<s> In-built webcam is working, but mic is not. </s>
<s> While installing software (drivers) from &quot;Webcam Resource CD&quot; it aborts after about 70% completion showing the following error: &quot;Cannot Install this Hardware there was a problem installing this hardware: (Logo) Monitor Webcam (SP2208WFP) An error occurred during installation of the device A service installation section in this INF is invalid Click Finish to close the wizard [Finish]&quot; I have searched Dell site but could not find any suitable driver. </s>
<s> It may please be noted that my OS is Windows XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> Anybody in the know please help me in finding proper driver and activate mic. </s>
<s> I can do with headphone, but I want to use in-built mic. </s>

<s> As I've told earlier, I know this site and tried this, but failed. </s>
<s> Pls suggest something that would work. </s>
<s> If you can't find yours then you get to call Dell for the file. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that some members confuse a monitor driver for the need of a display card driver. </s>
<s> I'm sharing the poor soul that spent 6 months looking for a Dell display driver and we solved the issue in 5 minutes by installing the card driver. </s>
