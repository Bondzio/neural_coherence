if you want to keep up with the current games, you are probably looking at replacing or upgrading the machine every 1-2 years, as the games producers take advantage of the developments in graphics cards and processors.
in these machines, the hardware is unlikely to break in its short life.
if you have a machine that you use for web surfing, email, office type applications, you'll probably need to replace or upgrade in 4-5 years.
during that time, you'll be replacing some components, hdds, adding ram, maybe adding a new optical drive and often this puts a strain on the power supply, which will run hotter and shorten its life.
most commercial machines won't be over generous with their power supplies, so keep an eye on anything you add to the system.
a self build will run for very much longer, i have a mini-tower that acts as my internet gateway and just a general web/email/smartsuite machine for anyone who needs it.
i built it in 1997!
since then, it's had a new power supply, a couple of additional hdds and more ram but essentially, its the same machine.
if you go down this route, though, remember the story of the lumberjack who still has his original axe - of course, it's has 4 new handles and six new heads but it's the same axe!
