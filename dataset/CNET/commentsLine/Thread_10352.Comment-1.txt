these days, i'm hearing more and more about alienware--&quot;extremely&quot; good things, and &quot;extremely&quot; bad.
here are just two examples:   there are countless more.
now i'd like to ask all of you what you &quot;really think&quot; of this &quot;controversial company&quot;...is it gold, or is it dross?
