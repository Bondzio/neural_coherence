<s> I'm looking for help on deciding what would be best. </s>
<s> I'm looking to purchase an inexpensive tablet for my mother-in-law. </s>
<s> Does NOT need to be anything special...I do own an IPAD 2 and it certainly doesn't need to be anything of that quality. </s>
<s> Really, she just wants to be able to read books on it (like an e-reader) and surf the web a little. </s>
<s> Doesn't need to have the best app selection or availability in the world, but if one has better access than the other, then great. </s>
<s> I'm looking for something around the $250 mark. </s>
<s> In order of importance for what she would need: 1) needs to be the larger 10&quot; screen size 2) read books 3) web surfing - doesn't need to be blazing fast...just adequate. </s>
<s> Although, if it would display web pages in their &quot;true form&quot; that is cerainly a plus compared to something that will only display them in their &quot;mobile&quot; format 4) general email Really, I'm looking at the following. </s>
<s> But if there is something better, by all means please suggest. </s>
<s> If not, can you recommend from this list based on my needs? </s>
<s> 1) Viewsonic gTablet 10.1 - can get around $250 right now 2) ARCHOS 101 Internet Tablet - can get around $230 right now 3) HP Touchpad - i know of the firsesale, but because of it you can still get them right now for around $250 so i'm throwing it into the mix Thank you for your help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I'll give a link. </s>
<s> I have the Viewsonic. </s>
<s> A good bargain but the display, while good has a pretty narrow viewing angle. </s>
<s> And read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19686_102-539880.html?tag=contentBody;threadListing where they were looking at cheap and found the HP. </s>

<s> So basically, it sounds like my mother-in-laws main &quot;needs&quot; for it are very very similar to the gentleman's in the other post you provided the link for. </s>
<s> In the end, he ended up finding a good deal on the HP Touchpad for $199 and seems very happy with his purchase, and confirmed it does everything he wanted very well. </s>
<s> Is it safe to say then, that with these specific &quot;needs&quot; considered, that forgetting about price since they're all similar, that the HP Touchpad is hands down a better quality product? </s>
<s> If so, I can wait and try to catch the deal when they put their last release out, or at very worst, pay basically the same $250 as these other options today and get a better product? </s>
<s> Even if I wait, and miss out on the next firesale, i would have to think that all of these other online retailers are still going to be in the $250 range for the HP Touchpad. </s>
<s> Some of the ones being discussed in the other thread (Nook color, etc) were the 7&quot; tablets, and I would really need it to be the 10&quot; so I ruled them out immediately. </s>
<s> But the short version is that folk &quot;snapped up&quot; the 99 buck HP on the firesale. </s>
<s> It does the basics of web browsing and reading (PDF?) </s>
<s> well enough. </s>
<s> It proves that folk will dive in at the 99 and 199 price. </s>
<s> --&gt; My prediction? </s>
<s> If you wait for it, the new Kindle might be in that price range since it will be subsidized by Kindle/Amazon book and app sales. </s>
<s> Yes, that's not here and now but worth noting. </s>
<s> I have the Nook Color and find it very useful. </s>
<s> I would look at that again. </s>
