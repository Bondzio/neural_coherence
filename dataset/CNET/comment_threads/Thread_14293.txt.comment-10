I have been looking into NAS for this situation as well.
I cannot seem to find a reliable, reasonably priced NAS that will suite their needs.
I have been reading a lot of reviews on different NAS devices and some people love them and some hate them.
Wasting an XP license isn't really a problem.
I have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of Windows 2000 that I no longer use.
I'm still researching all possibilities and haven't ruled the NAS out yet.
I also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the NAS or PC dies.
Thanks Michael
