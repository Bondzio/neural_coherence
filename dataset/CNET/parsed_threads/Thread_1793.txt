<s> i have a hp media center pc a1357c and i want to play some games like source. </s>
<s> but my internal graphics card(built in) only goes up to 64mb as far as i can tell... is there anything i can do to get better graphics without spending money... kinda strapped for cash </s>
<s> If this is your computer, http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?cc=us&docname=c00586067&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN ...then the specifications say that you have an open slot for inserting a PCI Express X16 (not AGP, not PCI) video card. </s>
<s> A good video card that has dedicated memory will not share slower system memory. </s>
<s> Shared memory includes ''integrated video,'' and video carda that have ''HyperMemory'' or ''TurboCache.'' </s>
<s> You can find PCI Express X16 video cards with dedicated memory for under $100 in the USA. </s>
<s> You may need a PSU upgrade to accommodate the more power hungry video cards. </s>
<s> im looking at the nvidia geforce 6800 online at newegg for 100.... good deal? </s>
