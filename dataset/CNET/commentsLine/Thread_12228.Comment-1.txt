i have an asus a78nx-e mother board that i have two hard drives that i want to be able to choose from one or the other at boot time which one i want to boot into.
one hard drive is xp and the other is mandriva linux.
currently, both jumpers are set to master.
my ribbon cable has a connectors for two hard drives.
is there any way to do this?
