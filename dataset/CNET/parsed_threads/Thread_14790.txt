<s> I'm a student and I spend about 80% of my time in a lab at school where I have my own personal computer and where it tends to get extremely loud. </s>
<s> I know I can just go out and buy any earphone for under 100$ and just crank up the volume until my brain is deteriorated by the bass vibrations and I start to drool all over myself, but I consider myself to have a pretty good ear and would like to keep it that way. </s>
<s> So now my question is, are there earphone out there (preferably in-ear but not restricted to) that can completely block out outside noise, like people not understanding that a 3 to 4 feet of air in between two people does not block sound and yell at the top of their lungs? </s>
<s> or if not what is the best noise cancellation (active or passive) earphone out there somebody can get, I know they can get pretty expensive but right now that's not the main issue. </s>
<s> I just want to be able to concentrate on what I'm doing and not hear people yell about whether they prefer tampons or pads and not damage my ear drumbs </s>
<s> you need to learn how to concentrate. </s>
<s> Or I might be wrong, maybe school are not like it use to be in my younger days (tell me that's not so). </s>
<s> But good luck in your search. </s>
<s> thank you for replying but, I'm also an audiophile and like to listen to good quality music and I also need to be able to hear what I'm doing for what I'm studying so you're comment was pretty much useless and insulting.... thanks though! </s>
<s> Good question; dumb answer, ahtoi. </s>
<s> I've wondered about this myself: if I want 'noise-cancelling' head/earphones, I want the really annoying noise cancelled, which is as often as not the very transient phenomena that 'cancellation' handles poorly: apple/carrot snackers, far-ters, toe-tappers, finger drummers, drivel-talkers, knuckle-crackers, too-loud earphone brain-damaged music listeners. </s>
<s> I remember one reviewer saying some headphones worked great on a plane to cancel internal jet-noise, but there was a mysterious clicking/popping sound in the phones; the passenger next to him was bopping along to some earphone music with mouth-click/pop accompaniment. </s>
<s> I gathered the plane noise would have been preferable masking of this idiocy than the useless 'cancellation': the most annoying noise was coming through front and center. </s>
