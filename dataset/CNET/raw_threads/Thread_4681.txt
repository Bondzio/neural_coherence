I can still play some games but at a slow framerate pase. What I want to know is. When you lower the resolution in the game, it shows improvement in every aspect except picture quality, but on mine if I lower the resolution in windows and the game is shows dramatic improvement. Is this just a thing in my head or does this happen in everyone elses comps? When computers get tested for benchemarks Frame Rates do they do this or what?

That is almost double the number of pixels. But the only thing I couldn't figure out was why the performance wasn't along the same lines as the number of pixels.. How can my friend run at 1600x1200 with only a 20FPS difference? The effect is negated by the number of textures, the number of objects and the number of polygons in the game. Since these are a constant that take up a majority of the processing power, the number of pixels has a smaller but still noticeable effect.
