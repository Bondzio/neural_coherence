<s> I have a D865glc intel motherboard with a Pentium 4 2.8 GHS processor, which currently has 2 - 256 mb pc2700 ddr 333mhz non-parity non ECC sticks of double sided ram arranged so as to bank switch or opperate in DDr mode, one stick in slot 0 bank A and one in slot 0 bank B. I tried to upgrade by installing memory with the same specs, only single sided, in the blank slots. </s>
<s> This didn't work well. </s>
<s> I then went to Intel's site and found that the board needed 4 sticks of double sided memory to expand to 1024 mb. </s>
<s> What possible difference does it make if the chips are on one or both sides if all other specs are the same? </s>
<s> Os the way they work different or what? </s>
<s> Do you have any electronics design background? </s>
<s> It has to do with the number of chipselects and the design of the stick and not if there are chips on both sides of the stick. </s>
<s> Maybe that's enough info for you? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Nope, no electronics design experience. </s>
<s> Just one question, though. </s>
<s> So, double sided doesn't necessarily mean chips on both sides of the ram stick? </s>
<s> Does that mean a stick with chips only on one side could be double sided in the way it works? </s>
<s> In other words : there is no way to tell if a stick of memory is double or singled sided by just looking at it? </s>
<s> That's why we use places like crucial.com and keep track of the make and models of the memory sticks so we can sort it out. </s>
<s> It's one of those things that just because the stick fits does not mean it's compatible. </s>

<s> Thanks for your time. </s>
<s> You've probably saved me from a big headache trying to figure out why some memory chip that looks &quot;double sided&quot; isn't working in my system. </s>
<s> All that glitters is not gold, or chips on both sides of a dimm doesn't necessarily double sided memory make. </s>
<s> When I run into this is mostly many year old machines. </s>
<s> Specifically those old workhouses based on LX, BX and some i8xx chipsets. </s>
<s> These chipsets had only some many memory select lines and quite often where you would have to dance around to find just the right memory sticks. </s>
<s> These are also fairly robust machines that rarely died which explains why you run into them so often. </s>
<s> PNY, and those store memory sticks are usually double sided and the usual 256 MB sticks are the ones that rarely work. </s>
<s> Why this is so is that the sticks are made purely for lowest price and what would work in the most systems. </s>
<s> I know it's a little tough at first, but keep trying... Bob </s>
