<s> Hi, I am about to buy a mac mini and I'm also about to buy a Sharp LC-32D62U LCD tv. </s>
<s> I want to use the tv as a monitor for the computer though. </s>
<s> Do I need to find a TV that has DVI too or would the computer show up on the tv if I just bought a DVI to HDMI cable and hooked up the DVI end to the computer and put the HDMI end to the tv? </s>
<s> with a DVI connector on one end and an HDMI on the other, you should get a picture. </s>
<s> Does that TV/Monitor have a DVI input? </s>
