<s> Ok, so I just upgraded from an Intel q6600(2.4Ghz) to a q9400(2.66Ghz). </s>
<s> Now, when overclocking with the 6600 I couldn't get it to go past 3.0Ghz (just wont boot past the windows logo screen), so I left it alone, figuring it was the just the chip. </s>
<s> But after upgrading, I have the same problem with he q9400, even though I know for a fact that the q9400 can be overclocked a lot higher. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me!? </s>
<s> I overclock through the BIOS btw. </s>
<s> Also, when sitting idle, the cpu drops to 2Ghz, but when I start an app, or do anything, it jumps back up to 2.66Ghz. </s>
<s> Maybe that has something to do with it? </s>
<s> System: EVGA 780i mobo Intel q9400 (2.66Ghz) with Asetek Liquid Cooling 8GB pc6400 OCZ/Corsair Ram nVidia 9800 GTX+ OC 1TB HDD </s>
<s> Have you tried booting up without overclocking? </s>
<s> ya it boots fine without overclocking </s>
<s> Well then, I'm sorry to say that the overclocking is the problem... </s>
<s> As a last effort you may want to check out if a bios update can correct or further your OC'ing efforts. </s>
<s> Just because you can OC, you basically find a level that can be sustained/stable. </s>
<s> Meaning, you can't go beyond a certain point w/o causing problems. </s>
<s> Thus, your results are less than you expect. </s>
<s> Further, some mtrbds. </s>
<s> even OC friendly maybe lacking in that those components are capable as expected when you reach the top levels. </s>
<s> Understand also, you may need to configure the cpu voltage besides the FSB, etc.. Also, your PSU should be a brute and provide every voltage as stable as possible. </s>
<s> This is all a careful balancing act and each increase done one step at a time until the best output can be had. </s>
<s> Of you had problems with the 6600, the most friendly of OC'able cpus then your problem lays elsewhere, IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
