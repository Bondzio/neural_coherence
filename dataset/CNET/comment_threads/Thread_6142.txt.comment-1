Dear Sire or Madam, I bought a Cnet C56k Data/Fax Internal Modem.
When I firstly tried to install it, it said that it's not compatible with Windows XP(Mine is Windows XP home edition).
Then I followed the Quick Star Guide Page9 regarding how to set up modem for Windows XP.
But I couldn't find &quot;System Properties&quot; or &quot;Device Manager&quot; So could you help me solve this problem and let me get online as soon as possible please?
Thank you so much for your help!
Star.
