Which processor should I buy to complete my system, an AMD Athlon FX-55 or AMD Athlon X2(4600 or 4800) by the way, this is hypothetical. What I do is I play games pretty often, and I multitask a lot. So, which one should I get, if I can?

If you can afford Fx-55, than get the 4800, the extra cache would not be much difference, but its bragiing rights. Roger
