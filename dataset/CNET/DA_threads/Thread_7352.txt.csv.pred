1.1.1	Have just finished putting together my new PC!!!	St
1.1.2	4.3g 2g RAM 300g hdd 512mb graphics!!!	St
1.1.3	2x 19&quot;widescreen tfts, 1x dvd rom 1x dvd writer drives, 520w case btw!	St
1.1.4	Last night all was fine (had yet to install dvd writer and fdd) new moniters running sweet!	St
1.1.5	popped the lid and connected dvdrw, fdd.	St
1.1.6	booted her up and it loads up went to my comp no cd drives (drong'go me hadnt set new drive to slave) did that whilst i was in there i also connected the silly temp probes from the cast up to the cpu hdd graphics, turned it on and 1st screen fine 2nd screen...1/2 way thru, power gone, turned its self off!	St
1.1.7	tried agen turned of slightly differnt place.	St
1.1.8	first i tried disconnecting dvd (both) fdd case fans etc to cut down on power - result, same next i had my NAS box 2xmoniters and comp on a 4 socket extention so i put the comp on its own - result, same i have also tried to disconnect everything the reconnect - result, same	St
1.2.1	and DO NOT reconnect.	St
1.2.2	Make the minimum possible assembly, check that it works and then add one item.	St
1.2.3	The best minimumm is with the mobo on a sheet of cardboard, but likely you won't go back to that.	St
1.2.4	You either have a hardware problem or the CPU is getting too hot.	St
1.2.5	Be advised that the mobo's power control circuit works even if the is no CPU/HSF, no memory etc.	St
1.2.6	Thus stip all things external to the mobo, Keep the front panel connections to the mobo.	St
1.2.7	Hit the front panel power switch and see if the power supply stays on as noted by seeing that its fan keeps rotating [assuming that the CPU/HSF is not plugged in.	St
1.2.8	Can't get past this point don't waste time trying to add anything, it won't help.	St
1.2.9	Solve this problem first.	St
1.2.10	Be aware that an ATX power supply puts the 5 volt standby voltage on the mobo any time that the supply is plugged into a hot AC plug [if switch on rear of supply is on].	St
1.2.11	This power is what allows the mobo's power control circuit to work sans anything else.	St
1.3.1	cheers i will give this a try.	Polite
1.3.2	i have a sneaking suspicion it is the psu ist self which will mean after i have added x many things it will trip any way lol	St
1.4.1	in advance, often leads to poor troubleshooting technique, thus missing key info.	St
1.4.2	Best of luck..	St
1.5.1	yeah i know this is the reason why i have asked the question on afew forums.	St
1.5.2	any problems in windows etc i can pretty much solve (spent 2hours reconfiging the GPOs in server 2003 on fri lol).	St
1.5.3	but am rusty with messing arround with hardware cheers	St
