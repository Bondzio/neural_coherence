<s> Hello, My mother has an Compaq Presario that's a few years old. </s>
<s> It's running Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> She called and said that the peripherals started working intermittently (monitor, keyboard, mouse), and now they don't work at all. </s>
<s> She says that the PC turns on, but nothing else does. </s>
<s> No lights on the keyboard, monitor doesn't come on..... </s>
<s> Does anyone know what the problem could be? </s>
<s> I'm going to go over and try to fix it. </s>
<s> I've done basic work on PC's like adding memory, drives... so I'm pretty comfortable &quot;getting under the hood&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> I bring a spare USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> Be prepared. </s>
<s> You think it could be something wrong with the USB card? </s>
<s> But then why wouldn't the monitor work? </s>
<s> The monitor isn't USB. </s>
<s> You may have the classic DEAD PC. </s>
<s> You are lucky in there are many articles on what to do. </s>
<s> Here's the link -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=THE+DEAD+PC&btnG=Google+Search Bob PS. </s>
<s> I still bring my parts box. </s>
<s> I'm not sure that would apply, as the actual PC turns on, just nothing else. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> The methods used are what I use even if it's just power only. </s>
<s> We unplug cards, etc... </s>
<s> But if I write that method I'd just be duplicating the web contents. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
