&quot;I just want to know why this is happening and if I get another stick of Apacer 512 PC3200 if the problem will go away or not :-|&quot; The usual issue can be the OS.
Windows 3, 95, 98 and ME have issues past 512MB.
Even NT, 2000 and XP may run fine on 256 or 512MB.
In fact, you may have found a flaw in your machine and since its very new, make it a warranty issue with your machine supplier.
Ask for it to be fixed or your money back.
