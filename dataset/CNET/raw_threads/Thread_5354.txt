I don't have much to spend and I see several Nvidia 6200 s on sale on ebay for 49.99 + approx $10 shipping. I have an Nvidia FX 5200 PCI now. My motherboard is an intel d865glc with an 8X AGP slot. Would I notice a lot of improvement?

On the AGP side, the ATi Radeon 9800 Pro-128 Meg and 9800 XT-256 Meg version was some of the best AGP card and still compares very well with X700 and Geforce 6600+GT PCI-X range cards, and might even be still available at a very good price.
