Hi: Just cruising through and noticed your posting: don't forget about the educational discount that Apple gives if you're a student.
I wasn't sure that Amazaon offers this, but it's worth the check.
You've probably already done this, but just in case.
I just bought a Macbook Pro, and am waiting for Case-Mate to release their Signature Suit for the 17&quot;.
It covers the Macbook completely and is left on while you use your laptop.
They have these for the 13&quot; & 15&quot;Macbooks and they have them in great colors.
Just a thought because it protects your MB from scratches and light thumps.
