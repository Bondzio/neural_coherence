1.1.1	Hello, I am an aspiring PC builder, and after much researh I have come upon many questions.	St
1.1.2	I guess my main question is this: Should I wait until Vista and Direct X 10 come out before I build my first system?	St
1.1.3	Will the new top of the line cards like the ATI 1900 512 mb be direct X 10 ready, or will a whole new set of cards come out just for DX 10?	St
1.1.4	Thanks you.	Polite
1.2.1	as for waiting, that's a personal choice.	St
1.2.2	the best cards in jan '07 will be better than today's cards, but they will be superseded by the new batch in jul '07.	St
1.3.1	july 07?	St
1.3.2	wow.	St
1.3.3	so will all current cards up to that point become obsolete or just have to run things in DX 9?	St
1.3.4	isnt Direct X just a thing you can download?	St
1.4.1	They might but here is something to note: DirectX 10 will be exclusive to Vista according to the Wikipedia article for DirectX.	St
1.4.2	While yes you download DirectX, it would be up to Microsoft to list what is compatiable with what and if they decide that XP and DirectX 10 don't work together then they don't work together.	St
1.4.3	Regards, JB	St
1.5.1	my reference to july '07 was not when dx10 cards will come out, but rather that waiting will always get you something better.	St
1.5.2	but that something better will always be passe in the next few months.	St
1.5.3	therefore you can wait for something better perpetually.	Sug
1.5.4	dx10 cards should be out in dec 06/jan 07.	St
1.6.1	OK, thanks for the reply.	Polite
1.6.2	I understand about waiting, you can wait forever and there will always be something else about to come out, you must take the plunge at some point!	St
1.6.3	This time though, there is an entirely new operating system, and DX 10.	St
1.6.4	I guess I mean to ask, is DX 10 so radically different that current cards will be incpable of running it, or is is simply a matter of liscensing and money that will stop current cards from running it?	St
1.6.5	I just cant imagine every card out right now suddenly becoming obsolete the day DX 10 is released.	St
1.6.6	I guess another way to put it is this way: when will game makers start really using DX 10 to make games?	St
1.6.7	If 99% of the video cards out there are not DX 10 capable, whats the point of even using DX 10?	St
1.6.8	they may as well play the waiting game and wait until a majority of users have a DX 10 card.	St
1.7.1	OK, I think I see waht you are saying.	St
1.7.2	I do plan on getting vista, so as long as I have vista I should be able to run DX 10 on a video card I buy today, like an ATI 1900.	St
1.7.3	But if I keep using XP I shouldnt expect to be able to run DX 10.	St
1.7.4	It all makes sense now.	St
1.7.5	Forgive me, I am a little slow on the uptake	St
1.8.1	...just like games today that employ sm3.0 and hdr lighting fall back to sm1.1/sm2.0 and bloom lighting.	St
1.8.2	dx10 is supposed to require new hardware.	St
1.8.3	but since nvidia is implementing some of its dx10 support at the driver level, some folks suspect a &quot;magic&quot; driver could make a high-spec dx9 card dx10 compliant.	St
1.8.4	if this is truly possible or will ever happen is pure speculation.	St
1.9.1	i think dx10 video cards are going to be like everything else.	St
1.9.2	Wait till after most of the bugs are worked out then buy.	St
1.9.3	There are always problems with new os's even though the date got pushed back on vista.	St
1.9.4	Im going to wait until around march to buy a card.	St
1.10.1	get the 8800 GTX or GTS... Its a fully DX10 compatible card... heres the links... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150205 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814150204 cheers!	St
1.11.1	the graphics cards that are currently on the market: for instance, the ATI x1950 pro, and the nvidia 7900 Gt, even though they are top of the line, don't support directx 10 wait for the nvidia 8000 series to be released.	St
1.11.2	it costs $675 and will be available within a few months.	St
1.11.3	And, this card can handle much more than the previous gen pcie cards.	St
1.11.4	Its a kick but card in SLI mode.	St
1.11.5	It has 1.5 gigs of gddr4 memory in sli mode.	St
