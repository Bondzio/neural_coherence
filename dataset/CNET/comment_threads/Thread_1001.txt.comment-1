I have a desktop pc with an intel cpu p4 530, ATI800xl vcard, 1G DDR1 ram at the moment But how should i updage this machine as I wanna play games, eg Quake 4, at 1600 x 1200 (as i am using 20&quot; widescreen lcd) with high details on as the above config seems to have problem to run game smooth enough.
Please advise and buget is less than US500 Thanks a lot.
