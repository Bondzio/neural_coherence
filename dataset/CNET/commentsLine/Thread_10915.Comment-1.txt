are pixel shaders and vertex shaders required for games?
i want to play left 4 dead, but their is one problem.
vertex shader ver.
: required - 2.0 , i have - 1.1 pixel shader ver.
: required - 2.0 , i have - 1.3 can i run that game at all?
i understand the game performance may be bad but i am willing to change some settings.
so my question is, will the game even start up, even if i lower the settings?
thanks
