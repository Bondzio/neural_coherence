1. the cable type appears to be 80 conductor ide in the drive case.
that means to stick to cable select.
2. you didn't look in the disk management you can find with start, help and support.
it's fine you looked in the device manager, but do try the other.
it could be an older design case that didn't support that drive or the drive just doesn't work in that case.
