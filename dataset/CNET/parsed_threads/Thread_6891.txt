<s> I have a SECURED Linksys wireless g router. </s>
<s> ( Every computer set up for wireless on our secured network must submit the computers MAC address to my fiance.) </s>
<s> We purchased a Playstation 2 and wanted the children to play in their room so we also purchased a Linksys wireless G gaming adapter. </s>
<s> Only problem is the game will not work unless it is on the first floor with the network direct connect. </s>
<s> Please help!!!!! </s>
<s> !We also run Windows XP professional edition. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>
<s> the only thing I can think of is your router might have a secure connect button where it turns off all security features for a minute or so, maybe and then you could connect the bridge. </s>
<s> If your router does not have this feature then you could buy one. </s>
<s> Besides that your out of luck as far I I can see. </s>
<s> Sorry:( </s>
