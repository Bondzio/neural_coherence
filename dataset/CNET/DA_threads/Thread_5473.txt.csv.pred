1.1.1	Hey everybody I'm a newbie on these forums.	St
1.1.2	I was on cnet live today.	St
1.1.3	They directed me here.	St
1.1.4	I called in asking about wanting to build a system now with one hard drive, but later as my budget allows add additional hard drives in a raid array.	St
1.1.5	The only way I know how to do this is to reinstall the OS and start from scratch.	St
1.1.6	Is there a way to streamline this process so I can add drives and not lose my data or rebuild the array every time?	St
1.2.1	Someone would do that by bouncing their OS image to a bigger drive.	St
1.2.2	Such as installing the raid and using Acronis to copy the existing drive to the RAID.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	OK.	St
1.3.2	So right now I'm starting with a 1TB Seagate hard drive.	St
1.3.3	What you are saying is, when I am ready to add matching hard drives, I should buy an extra one to make a backup image, build the raid array, and then restore the image now on the raid array.	St
1.3.4	I guess then I could wipe the back up hard drive and take it back to the store for a refund.	St
1.3.5	This is a good idea and defiantly solves the problem of losing my data, but the process still isn't what I'm looking for.	St
1.3.6	Maybe I'm asking for too much but I just want an easy way to add hard drives to an array without having to rebuild the array or back up my data.	St
1.3.7	After all, one of the main advantages of using raid is that you don't need to make backups because you would have to have two or more hard drives fail at the same time before the array failed.	St
1.4.1	It may be time to address what the backup plans are.	Sug
1.4.2	Imagine my shock yesterday as a friend showed me their 20 TB storage server.	St
1.4.3	They didn't have an answer to what to do if it was struck by lightning, theft, &quot;oops, I deleted it&quot;... Bob	St
1.5.1	First of all, I want to start by saying I am a person who has 4 backups of my essential data at any given time.	St
1.5.2	I keep a golden image of my machines as well backup my personal data in several locations.	St
1.5.3	But to have a complete disk image of a raid array that I want to eventually reach 4tb would just be impractical.	St
1.5.4	I understand what your saying.	St
1.5.5	It is important to have backups of your data so you can get everything back in the event of a catastrophe, but all I want to do is build my system with one hard drive now, and add more in the future, the easiest way possible.	St
1.6.1	I wonder if you didn't like the solution since you end up with a drive along the way.	St
1.6.2	Isn't time == money?	St
1.6.3	Or rather let be very blunt here.	St
1.6.4	NO CURRENT SOLUTION EXISTS for you to install drive number 2 and create a raid without a wipeout of the first drive.	St
1.6.5	Is that more clear?	St
