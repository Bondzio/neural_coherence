1.1.1	Having problems with both CDRW and DVD.	St
1.1.2	Windows sees the drives in &quot;My Computer&quot; but is having problem reading data or even recognizing that a CD is in the drive.	St
1.1.3	Was trying to Burn a CD today and got a message that an error was received from the &quot;Output Device&quot; (the CDRW) with the suggestion to check that the drive is installed.	St
1.1.4	Does this mean to check the cables like I saw recommended in another post?	St
1.1.5	I would think that if a cable is loose or disconnected that the drive wouldn't even be recognized.	St
1.1.6	I was able to reboot once and the drive recognized data on a CD but would not burn a CD.	St
1.1.7	Will also do some housecleaning inside .	St

1.2.3	The owner appears to be in denial about it, but do read that discussion to see what to try.	St
1.2.4	Here's the discussion so you can save yourself from the same dialogue.	St

1.3.1	This was my first question.	St
1.3.2	I was referring to a couple of other posts regarding CD/DVD in this forum.	St
1.3.3	Sorry if I mislead you.	St
1.3.4	Thanks for the link to other question/answers.	St

1.3.6	I'll try the housekeeping routine first and a CD cleaner.	Sug
1.3.7	This isn't my PC.	St
1.3.8	I was helping a friend and I know she doesn't have the extra money to buy a new CD burner right now so was hoping there might be some other suggestions.	St
1.3.9	Thanks Patti	St
1.4.1	Some get bulk CDRs and run into a bad batch.	St
1.4.2	For instance I get a bad batch and the CDR needed help since the ATIP information called the CDR 40X but the speed was really 16X.	St
1.4.3	Nero allowed me to set the record speed to 16X and the CDR was usable.	St
1.4.4	I felt this was OK for me, but not for others.	St
1.4.5	If you want to know about ATIP and more, type CDR FAQ into google.com Bob	St
