1.1.1	I have 2 routers I would like to use.	St
1.1.2	An Apple Airport Extreme(AAE) which streams NAS media better and a Cisco that gets a stronger internet 2 ghz connection.	St
1.1.3	So basically use the Cisco for internet access and use AAE for home media.	St
1.1.4	Can I connect to both routers at the same time?	St
1.1.5	2 examples where I need to have both routers connected are A) Using Macbook or Ipad to Stream media from internet via Cisco and simultaneously playing through wireless home speakers on the AAE network.	St
1.1.6	B) Download material on laptop while watching a movie from the AAE NAS	St
1.2.1	But this is done a lot when you use &quot;Router as an Access Point.&quot; See Google to see how that is connected and setup.	St
1.2.2	The owner of such must learn their routers since they will be maintaining this.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
