you have a different gpu chipset and from 512mb to 256mb ram difference, expect a slight change in output.
if the gpu box/manual suggests a psu rating, then you need that.
of course be sure all the drivers, etc.
are installed right.
the old drivers as well should be removed before the new video card was installed, it can cause conflict(s).
