<s> Hello My computer has been slow lately. </s>
<s> I ran Disk Utility to verify and got the message: &quot;Volume Header needs minor repair. </s>
<s> The volume &quot;My Mac&quot; needs to be repaired. </s>
<s> Error: Filesystem verify or repair failed&quot; This problem started yesterday when I ran Onyx and Onyx asked me where Firefox.bin was. </s>
<s> I then ran Disk Utility and at that time there was a problem with one file missing so I restarted with the install dvd and repaired the volume. </s>
<s> Now when I use Disk Utility from the install dvd or TechTool, I get the message that the volume is okay but when I use Disk Utility when the startup volume is the hard drive or OnyXthe the verify fails. </s>
<s> I have run Disk Utility when the user was &quot;Test&quot; and get the same message that the Volume Header needs minor repair. </s>
<s> I have zapped the PRAM. </s>
<s> At this point, I don't know what do next.Please help. </s>
