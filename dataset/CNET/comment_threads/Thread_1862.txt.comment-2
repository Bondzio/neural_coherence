If you're using a Linksys router with the RT31P2 Vonage adapter it will work fine.
Linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base ID 358.
I am using the same system with no problems...essentially you &quot;cascade&quot; the routers...change the router IP to 192.168.15.2...disable DHCP...from your modem you connect to Internet port of the RT31P2...connect &quot;ethernet (1) on the RT31P2 to your router (I connected to &quot;4&quot;) All this may sound confusing, at least it does to me, so your best bet is to check out the Linksys Knowledge base...even ask their tech help via e-mail...that's what I did and they were most helpful.
This system works great with no problems - good luck
