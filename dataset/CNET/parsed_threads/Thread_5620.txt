<s> We have three laptops in our home. </s>
<s> All have internal wireless cards. </s>
<s> I have a cable modem from my ISP. </s>
<s> I previously had a Linksys 2.4GHz wireless access point router connected to the cable modem and all 3 laptops were able to connect to that wireless signal. </s>
<s> The strength was mediocre and transmission speeds were awful. </s>
<s> The linksys router was over 5 years old and just died this morning. </s>
<s> I believe all laptops are running XP. </s>
<s> Can you please recommend the best wireless router for: -home use -strong signal strength (would like the signal to reach the 4 rooms that surround the office where the router is located... walls are drywall only) -ease of use -reliability -fast, fast, fast Also, I want to setup my laserjet on a wireless at the same time. </s>
<s> Can you recommend what I need to accomplish this? </s>
<s> I know just enough to get by so please try and keep explanations simple. </s>
<s> I'm not very literate on networks! </s>
<s> THANK YOU EVERYONE! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have this one now, the DIR-655. </s>
<s> But I still own a Linksys WRT-350N. </s>
<s> Signal strength is affected by walls, naturally. </s>
<s> But the angle at which the signal hits the wall can be decieving. </s>
<s> A sheetrock wall is around 4&quot; thick. </s>
<s> But if the wall is at an angle to the router, the thickness can be several feet. </s>
<s> All routers transmitted power are the same and regulated by the FCC. </s>

<s> Whatever you do, stay away from the linksys WRT350N, It drops signals without cause and has been a headache for me generally. </s>
<s> The good old WRT-54G will do wonders for a cheap price. </s>
<s> If you however need storage and the other cool stuff such as higher encryption, you may want to check out other lines </s>
