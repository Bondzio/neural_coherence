I would gladly accept recommendations about different sound cards which have got good test results and are worth the money.

The next is the analog inputs tend to be noisy compared to any Creative Labs card made in the past decade. Beyond that I'd try the onboard sound first. Bob

I'd encourage you to try the built-in before investing in an add-on.
