I've had it running overnight and it is once again performing great!
Even tested it on Crysis for over an hour and no freezing and then played some Portal 2 and Space Marine without any issues either.
Thank you to: &quot;VAPCMD&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;RiviverSoft&quot; for sticking by me and doing your best to help me out!
