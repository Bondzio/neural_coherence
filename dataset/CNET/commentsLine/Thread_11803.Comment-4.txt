looks like i'm better off just eating the cost of those cards and go with something more compatible.i'm even going to reconsider the whole amd thing,too.i've never used intel so i'm not sure if it's rated better or worse but i was looking at a barebones builder and came up with this  it's definitely a little more than i was wanting to spend,but doing it right the first time pays off
