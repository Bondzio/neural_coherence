I am considering two, preowned netbooks: Acer Aspire One, 1.6 GHz, 8.9&quot;, 1 GB RAM, 120 G Hardrive or the Asus EEE pc 900a netbook with an 8.9 inch with 4gb Hardrive Main question...there is a big difference between a 120 hard drive and 4 gb. Also it seems that one has a ssd drive instead of a hard drive. Advantages/disadvantages?

I own the 160GB model of the Acer and frankly I'm beginning to see folk think these are laptop replacements. It won't be long till someone files a carpal tunnel lawsuit or similar. &quot;Hey boss, I saved big bucks and set up the staff on Netbooks!&quot;

If the HD was the only consideration, I'd go with the 120 gb unit in a heartbeat The other hardware on the two products will be fairly comparable. Price would be a determining factor. I'd definitely want to pay less for the one with the smaller drive.

I own the 900A myself but because I fit in the geek category and knew I was going to change the 4GB SSD hard drive (btw it's a POS, the first linux update will either crash the comp or get errors) to larger SSD drive (which is what I did, to 16GB for about $50). Asus is great if you like to mod it but Acer is the better buy if you don't and they cost the same.
