Open a command prompt to run CHKDSK.
For me the command is... CHKDSK T: /F /X If the drive needs to be checked later, answer yes.
-&gt; This will also occur if the drive is full to the brim.
Remove a GB and see if that and CHKDSK helps.
If not, find the drive fitness test and don't trust this drive.
