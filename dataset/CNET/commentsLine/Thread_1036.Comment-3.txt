with the sata cable from inside your computer you will also need the sata power adapter.
if you did this please forgive me for asking.
question: when you start your pc with it connected does it spinup (can you hear it or feel it?
if it does then go to start, all programs, administrative tools,computer managment, & select disk management.
does your drive apear here?
if not the drive is more than likely dead.
you can take it to a repair shop, and get their opinion.
so time it can be repaired.
i use a program called spinrite.
it takes along time but it recovers drives and data that other techs say are dead drives.
hope this helps...
