<s> I would like to build my own computer. </s>
<s> I am a gamer but at this time, with my Gateway Pentium III, I am not able to play the game I like. </s>
<s> The requirements for this game is -Operating System: Windows 98/2000/ME/XP -Processor: 1GHz or greater -RAM: 512 MB -Video Card: DirectX 9 compatible. </s>
<s> Pixel shader and vertex shader compatible hardware with 64 MB of texture memory -Sound Card: DirectSound compatible audio hardware The game is every-expanding, so need more room for expansion. </s>
<s> I don't know where to start. </s>
<s> I have heard it is easy to build your own computer. </s>
<s> I cannot afford to pay $2000+ for a system at this time, but think if I buy the components and make one myself, I can afford to do it. </s>
<s> After looking up the components, I am totally comfused. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Really what I need is a baseline on what I need. </s>
<s> Maybe look at this site www.mysuperpc.com </s>
<s> CNet has some good info on building a new machine. </s>
<s> I just put together the following system AMD 64 /3000 - 512 Mem - 80G SATA HD - CD/DVD burner - ATI 9800 Video card - EPox MB OS XP Home SP2. </s>
<s> I used my old CRT and accessories. </s>
<s> Total cost with taxes and shipping came to a shade more than $800 total. </s>
<s> I used Newegg.com for most of the parts. </s>
<s> They have reviews of the parts as well as very good customer service. </s>
<s> You will learn about all the different choises you have available on Chip and Motherboard combinations. </s>
<s> For cost reasons I choose the AMD 64 vs the Intel chip. </s>
<s> You can get some good buys on AMD XP chips but they are at the end of their development. </s>
<s> I figured I could go with the 754 socket in the AMD 64 line and get a couple more years of service by up grading the CPU when the prices drop on the 3800+ versions. </s>
