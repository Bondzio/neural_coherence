<s> I recently did a re-install of OS 10.2.8 because I was told I had corruption issues. </s>
<s> Since then, I have been unable to burn CD`s, either with Toast or iTunes; I get a message that the drive is busy or reserved by another application, even though nothing else is running. </s>
<s> I just checked Apple System Profiler and the info about the drive (Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-103) states that disc burning is not supported. </s>
<s> I`ve had this computer for several years (G4 AGP with the builtin burner) and never had trouble burning CDs before. </s>
<s> What did I do wrong with the OS re-install and how can I fix it? </s>
<s> Difficult to say what went wrong during the re-install. </s>
<s> I guess a good question would be to ask what sort of corruption issues you had and who advised you. </s>
<s> What sort of re-install did you do? </s>
<s> Complete Format and install or a Clean Archive and Install? </s>
<s> This drive was not original equipment on this machine which raises the question, did you have a patch installed to enable this burner to function with OS X? </s>
<s> Something like PatchBurn from OWC? </s>
<s> I remember Apple being very fussy about what burners worked in their systems. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I bought the computer used; it was my first (and only) OS X computer and I never did figure out how to back up the startup disk, so I have no way of knowing what was on it. </s>
<s> The corruption issue was that the computer kept forgetting settings for Netscape and other apps, and that I couldn`t start up in OS 9.2 without the computer hanging up during startup. </s>
<s> I did a Clean Archive and Install. </s>
<s> I still can`t start up in OS 9 but Netscape does seem to remember settings now. </s>
<s> I had described my problems on this forum and was told that a reinstall sounded like what I needed. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> that you cannot start up in OS 9.2 Even though you have installed OS X 10.2.8 you should still be able to start up in 9.2 These corruption issues, were they in OS 9 or where they in OS X. </s>
<s> Are you starting in X and then switching to OS 9 (Classic), a situation you should try to avoid. </s>
<s> Once you make the move to X, it is easier on your nerves to attempt to do everything in X rather than go back to 9 from X Which OS are you now having problems with, OS X or OS 9(Classic)? </s>
<s> I remember that I suggested that you get a copy of OS X 10.3. </s>
<s> There is a distinct possibility that the system is now so messed up that the best move is to wipe it all out and start again. </s>
<s> Let us know about the 9 & X situation. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I`ve no idea what I did; today the blasted thing is listed under Apple Profiler as fully enabled and burns anything I want. </s>
<s> I still can`t start up in OS 9; even the Norton disk won`t start up; it hangs up after the startup screen. </s>
<s> I did put in a new Sonnet processor back in September (Sonnet Encore/ST G4), but on the box it states that the upgrade requires OS X and OS 9.2 and that 9.2 IS supported. </s>
<s> I`m getting OS 10.4.2 Monday and will upgrade; I hope it helps. </s>
<s> I still have a ton of legacy software, or I`d give up on OS 9. </s>
