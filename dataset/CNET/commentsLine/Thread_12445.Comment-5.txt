dear p, it's on me, not you, but frankly, i didn't anticipate a reply.
thanks for this one; it's food for thought, though i probably shall get the radio shack ones, after all.
oddly enough, the computer's own sound has increased (who knows why), although i still think i'd get more out of external speakers, and even modest ones.
many thanks again.
i'll surely let you know what happens.
