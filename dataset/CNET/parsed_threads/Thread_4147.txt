<s> I've been having this weird problem with my new ATI AGP video card, and now I am thinking it's caused by a conflict... </s>
<s> There are TWO Radeon drivers installing because Windows keeps detecting a secondary one on a PCI port! </s>
<s> I remove them every time, but they keep coming back. </s>
<s> I have Radeon Ati 9700 and it comes with driver installers and software combined CD. </s>
<s> The computer relies on windows drivers through the PCI until told otherwise. </s>
<s> It could be that either you have not installed Ati drivers properly, or whatever version of Ati is in conflict with windows. </s>
<s> What does 'roll back drivers' do if you have a version of XP? </s>
<s> Second....I also have ATI AIW 9700 Pro and in Device Mgr, it always shows two entries by default. </s>
<s> If you read through the install text (read me file) it will explain to you somewhere in it that this is normal. </s>
<s> So I would gather that your weird issue isn't related to that, and request that you describe what's happening. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
