i have read all posts that seemed helpful to me.
but my question is one of a more technical nature.
i don't know what i need to solder.
on this site:  i can't see what is broken in the circled soldered bit.
i mean, what is wrong with it?
and should it touch the silver lining/print on the green board?
that's basically my question.
i know i do not come forward as the most technical person by asking these questions, but i hope people will help me anyway.
thanx.
