1.1.1	I bought the HIS Radeon X1550 64 bit to help update my system , but i 'm having a few problems and i have a few Questions .	St
1.1.2	My GPU history was a Diamond 9250 256mb DDR 128bit , then i got a PNY 8400GS 512mb GDDR2 64bit card , returned the 8400gs for fianance reasons , saved up and bought this instead .	St
1.1.3	Both the 8400 and this are 64 bit , they both had problems with madden 06 , glitchy , but the 9250 was perfect , at about medium settings .	St
1.1.4	If you know how to fix this please tell me .	St
1.1.5	Next the GPU-Z program says my Bus Bandwith is like 3.1 gb/s .	St
1.1.6	But the 8400 ran at 6.4 and so did the 9250 radeon , they both only required a 300 Watt PSU ( i have a 250 ) but the X1550 says it needs 450watt , and on the Tigerdirect site it said that it had a 12.8gb/s banwith , and the HIS site said 6.4gb/s ( more beilivable ) would this be a PSU issue or something else i really want that bandwith , or could it be GPU-Z .

1.2.1	your performance issues are to be expected since it 's a very low-end gpu with 64bit memory using a pci slot .	St
1.2.2	( agp or pci-express cards would run a lot faster . )	St
1.2.3	you should only use the drivers bundled with the card -- *don't* use ati/amd 's latest drivers .	St
1.2.4	your power supply is probably not an issue since the card draws all of its power from the pci slot .	St
1.2.5	the amount of current in a pci slot can deliver is fixed and does not change based on the power supply .	St
1.3.1	I know PCI sucks , i have had AGP on a Pentium 3 board and considered going back just for the AGP .	St
1.3.2	But the PNY 8400gs 64 bit PCI card i used to have ( also lowend chipset ) ran at 6.3gb/s , same as my old 128 bit 9250 , confusing ?	Ques
1.3.3	thanks , bigboy	Polite
