1.3.1	Your specs show no immediate support for PATA type ( EIDE ) HDs .	St
1.3.2	Unless , the CD drives have use of an EIDE port , then you *may* install an IDE HD , but it wo n't be quick or as desirable other than it can be used .	St
1.3.3	If you plan to use some old IDE HD , you may have to look at some adapter to attach on IDE drive then i/f with SATA port .	St
1.3.4	IMO , you would be better served simply to have a SATA type drive to install .	St

1.4.1	If you have the Dell XPS 600 Motherboard nForce4 SLI XH241 , it sure looks like there is an IDE connection .	St
1.4.2	Open the case and have a look .	St
1.5.1	You wo n't need to change anything , set the jumper on the IDE HD to slave .	St
1.5.2	Just connect to existing IDE cable and reload your XP CD .	St
1.5.3	Do a full format , it should work like any other reload .	St
