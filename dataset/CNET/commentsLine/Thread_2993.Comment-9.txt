a video card can on its own task the psu and the mtrbd.
as only so much power can be gotten via the mtrbd.. which is why the psu provides direct power connects if in fact they use them.
i mention the power leg because on a single rail, all power becomes available, but if split rail, it divides the power supplied.
the quick anser i got was 22amps and that's alot but it may not so easily seem so.
you do what you got to do, because there are close relationship power wise for psu and video demands.
so, don't easily dismiss as it should have worked.
sometimes, the demands are on the cusp of what is provided and quality matters come into play for simple it can't deliver.
