<s> I have a computer at work and want to play call of duty, but do not want to save it to the work computer or even make it look like I was playing games. </s>
<s> No one cares what I do at work, I just would like to have something to do in my free time. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I want to know if I would be able to save the game to a external hd and put the cd-rom in the tray and begin playing. </s>
<s> We are hesitant to advice about possible violations of company IT-policies. </s>
<s> Usually we say &quot;ask the IT guy&quot;. </s>
<s> I see no reason to do otherwise here. </s>

<s> Even if you are able to do that, some, maybe lots of files will have to be dropped at the root folder. </s>
<s> You need that IT guy/gal to do that ? </s>
