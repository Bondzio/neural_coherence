whether these speakers are attached via USB, 3.5mm plug or an fiber optic, could you tell me?
The built in speakers on the iMac do a decent job.
Is the sound from the internal speakers better than the sound from the external speakers?
In the System Preferences\Sound Preference pane, is the output set to the external speakers?
