&quot;Is there any point investing in a slower 2.0Ghz Core 2 Duo?&quot; It's a common misconception that processing power is based on solely on clock speed.
It's not only about the Ghz, there's the cache size and more importantly, the chip architecture.
A newer Core 2 based processor (regardless of the clock speed, because even lower end chips overclock like crazy) will be worth the upgrade and it will be faster than your older processor.
