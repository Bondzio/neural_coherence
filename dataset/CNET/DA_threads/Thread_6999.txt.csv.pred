1.1.1	I recently bought a 20 & quot ; flat panel and I want to improve my video performance .	St
1.1.2	These are the specs on my PC : Pentium III 800 MHz 512 MB SDRAM 100 MHz NVidia GeForce DDR 64 MB AGP 1X/2X/4X Would I see any noticeable improvement if I just added a mid-level video card like the ATI Radeon 9600 128 MB w/ DVI out or would the CPU/RAM require upgrading as well ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks is advance , P| & lt ;	St
1.2.1	By video performance , do you mean gaming ( I think not with a 800 mhz system ) ?	Ques
1.2.2	Upgrading a video card for better & quot ; video-quality & quot ; is almost useless , unless your current video card does n't support your monitors ' native resolution .	St
1.2.3	You may get more options such as brightness controls or such , but that wo n't warrent the money for a new card .	St
1.3.1	It 's a marriage arrangement , that they have to be in par with each other for optimum output .	St
1.3.2	If you can find a Geforce with increased ram of 128 or better of the same type video card , that 's your best chance .	St
1.3.3	YES , you will need to increase the system speed ( cpu ) to keep up with one of the newer cards .	St
1.3.4	However , you can throttle down a new video card with its setup s/w for a less demanding but certainly better than old output .	St
1.3.5	Check their support website for details .	St
1.3.6	Also , newer AGP video may outstrip ( added connection ) the power supply as now they require 30W+ where as older units are 20-25W range , take that into condiration .	St
1.3.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	Before I opened my wallet I would look into free stuff like finding the proper mobo and vid drivers that mated to the OS I was using and gave me the best perf .	St
1.4.2	Do n't assume the newest drivers are best , you must test .	St
1.4.3	I do n't know what type of vid perf your looking for but I suspect that 800cpu and 100memory are going to be a problem .	St
