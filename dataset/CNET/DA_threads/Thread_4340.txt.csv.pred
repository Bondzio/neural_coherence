1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I am planning on opening an Internet Cafe and I have planned to do the networking as shown in the image .	St
1.1.3	Please be kind enough to help me on what sort of Server I have to build ( including Hardware specs . )	St
1.1.4	and how to do the networking .	St
1.1.5	Thank s in advance .	St
1.1.6	Please find my sketch in the following link .	St
1.1.7	http : //lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hU48MNkF9z0/T9KJhb6ixPI/AAAAAAAAAfM/xKmgp9GJQCg/s960/Net+Cafe+Setup.png	St
1.2.1	And have n't we learned that it costs more than putting a cheap PC out there ?	Ques
1.2.2	Or are you new to this ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	By the way , I wan na provide an excellent and Hi-tech service to my customers .	St
1.3.2	So , I selected this way rather than putting cheap stuffs .	St
1.3.3	Talk about the project , not about the cost .	St
1.3.4	Thank you .	St
1.4.1	I see you are new so I need to give you time to discover that design had its day .	St
1.4.2	It 's no longer done for many reasons including the fact the cost is more than a PC at each station .	St
1.4.3	Write back when you are ready .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I agree with you that building a server is more expensive than setting up individual PCs .	St
1.5.2	But , I wan na do it in this way .	St
1.5.3	So , please help me .	Sug
1.6.1	I can only guess you 've not learned that there is no such server made today .	St
1.6.2	That is , once in awhile you get the new person that thinks you can hang display , keyboard and mouse on some server and make it all work .	St
1.6.3	They usually get upset there is nothing less than 2 times the cost of a PC .	St
1.6.4	So here 's the company and the products .	St
1.6.5	http : //www.citrix.com/English/partners/programs/fourthLevel.asp ? programID=1681660 & tlID=163199 & flID=1859519 So there you go .	St
1.6.6	Citrix on the server and HDX thin clients .	St
1.6.7	Done .	St
1.6.8	I wonder still if you were so new you expected no client hardware .	St
1.6.9	Bob	St
1.7.1	Or why any PC at all ?	Ques
1.7.2	Why not some internet cafe hot spot and folk bring their own PC , pad or such ?	Ques
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	OMG !	St
1.8.2	I did n't expect such a setup .	St
1.8.3	It is easy and economical for me to setup individual PCs rather than setting up Thin Clients and stuffs .	St
1.8.4	I thought I could build a big size CPU with some extra VGA outputs and USB ports for my project .	St
1.8.5	So , I am going to set up some vertical Desktop CPUs , so that I can make a compact setup .	St
1.8.6	Anyhow , thank you for your kind information .	Polite
1.9.1	Folk made such things .	St
1.9.2	They were awfully expensive as each card was essentially a PC on a card .	St
1.9.3	Since it was not made in the volumes of your common PC or laptop the prices were always more than your PC .	St
1.9.4	But folk always tried such things .	St
1.9.5	Today I rarely seen a Citrix or Windows Terminal system because the PC is too cheap .	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	Yeah Bob that is what a couple of local outfits do here , it is really all he needs to do .	St
1.11.1	You sell the coffee and treats .	St
1.11.2	Internet access is not a product today but a service at your store .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	I am not going to start the business in USA or any EU countries .	St
1.12.2	It 's in Sri Lanka .	St
1.12.3	So , do n't compare your business strategies with us .	St
1.12.4	We ca n't do business here as you do there .	St
1.13.1	I am not going to start only a browsing center .	St
1.13.2	Also , we do computer hardware and software troubleshooting , mobile phone repairing and upgrading , Photoshop and other typesetting deals and so on .	St
1.13.3	I have no idea to sell coffee and treats as you suggest .	St
1.14.1	Wow , that 's ambitious .	St
1.14.2	In the USA it 's pretty much just reset the phone and if it has a bad screen or jack you swap out a new phone .	St
1.14.3	The days of repairing a phone are long gone .	St
1.14.4	I 'm guessing this is not in the USA .	St
1.14.5	No one I know would attempt what you wrote here .	St
1.14.6	For many reasons .	St
1.14.7	Bob	St
1.15.1	My answers are mostly about areas from China , Taiwan and US/Canada .	St
