I'm not sure how much you are planning to spend, but there are plenty of small external hard drive enclosures which offer hot-swap capability from companies like Seagate, Drobo, Thecus, NetGear, etc.
The easiest thing will be to purchase two (or more) equal sized/type drives for the new enclosure and copy your existing data to them.
Good Luck!
