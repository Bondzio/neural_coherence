i can see from the post that this is a complicated area for most folks, but i didn't find specific answers to my questions.
i have a dell latitude laptop running 2000 pro.
i purchased a linksys wireless g network usb adapter.
i have installed the software.
now i wish to access the network at my church office ( for one) and utilize other access points i.e.
when traveling.
do i have the right equipment to access the internet only?
are there setting and configurations i must account for?
if more info is needed please let me know?
i am totally unfamiliar with this stuff some explain as simple as possible.
thanks, joe
