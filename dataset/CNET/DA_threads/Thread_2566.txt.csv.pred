1.1.1	I am trying to understand about IP addresses .	St
1.1.2	My understanding is that everyone has one if you are on the internet .	St
1.1.3	If I run Belarc advisor , it reports these IP addresses : 1394 Net Adapter NVIDIA nForce Networking Controller primary Auto IP Address : 192.168.1.102 / 24	St
1.2.1	It appears you did this from your PC behind your router .	St
1.2.2	Unless you pay for it you will only get a single IP from your ISP .	St
1.2.3	That is your 71.56.46.184 address .	St
1.2.4	Since there is only 1 ip address the device you plug into the modem or other device the ISP uses gets this IP .	St
1.2.5	If you run without a router your PC will directly get the ip .	St
1.2.6	When you use a router the router pretends all the machines at your location come from the same address .	St
1.2.7	In effect your machine has 2 addresses .	St
1.2.8	The 192.168.1.102 is your & quot ; fake & quot ; address .	St
1.2.9	These are actually called private addresses and are used to reduce the actual number of ip used .	St
1.3.1	bill102 said thoroughly just about all there is to be said .	St
1.3.2	But not that I 'm adding to the topic at hand ; I would take that private information off the web .	St
1.3.3	It may open you up to spam or other personal privacy invasion .	St
1.3.4	Just a little warning .	St
