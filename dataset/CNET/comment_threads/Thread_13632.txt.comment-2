Since installing a new hdd would require a re-install of the operating system, I would proceed with caution.
The Dell is a proprietary system.
If you plan to use the reinstall disk that came with the computer to reinstall windows, check with Dell support for their guidance.
It may work, then maybe not.
Hardware changes to the system may cause the OS to balk on installing.
A workaround could be an external usb hdd.
Note: If you have an original Windows cd, (not Dell reinstall disk), you won't have a problem.
Best of Luck
