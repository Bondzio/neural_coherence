in the early 80's purchased a c-64 with a monitor.printer,floppy drive.
that still works perfectly.
my son who is in 3rd yr of college as a programmer used it not to long ago and worked super.
also have a mess of c64 mags and games and programs.
i originally purchased it to do secretary work for bowling leagues.
anybody have a idea what it would be worth?
might be interested in selling.
