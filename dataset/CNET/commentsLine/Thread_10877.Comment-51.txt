ssd drives have a limited lifespan that is built into the drive (part of the technology).
it is measured in &quot;write cycles&quot;.
it has nothing to do with age except that the older the drive, the more write cycles are usually used up.
reliability would be mtbf (mean time between failures) and has nothing to do with this expiration period.
it's like how long your house will remain standing vs. when your lease runs out, if that makes any sense.
