okay, so I did what I was suppose to do...count the beeps an research....I think I got it now...I told ya I'am not a computer wiz ...I had 2 sticks of memory I inserted in the ram slots 0&1...same problem...beeps...so after a cooling off period...I thot maybe those were bad...so I pulled them out an put another stick ....guess what ...it loads up ...yep, no beeps...I think I just stuck the wrong type of ram sticks in...not that I understand the difference between sdimm or dramm or whatever..
I guess the motto is...dont get frustrated..step away for a while..oh and that just because they fit the slot ...dosent mean there RIGHT.
