6044	0	64055	760500	NR	J.Y.C.	2/12/05 9:41 PM	1.10824446E12	Need help with transferring components	I have recently switched my old components into a new case that I purchased from Newegg.com, and I have encountered serious problems now. First of all, when I put everything back in the new case and connected all the cables, everything else was working (PCI, drives...etc) except my PS2. Secondly, after messing around with the motherboard for a while, my HD turned out not so good either. I kept receiving a message of &quot;CMOS error - Defaults loaded&quot; then it stoped at that point. I figure that I can get the PS2 connection back on by re-installing the motherboard's driver, but can anyone help me recove my HD? I believe I have made all the right connections, any kind of help will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Joe

How is the hard drive and the CMOS error related? What makes you say that the hard drive has problems. Can you boot up and get into the BIOS, or does the CMOS error come up first? Might try a new CMOS battery, just to eliminate it. No chance that the mobo got mounted such that it is shoting to the mounting plate???

And I did get the BIOS when I booted it up, it has found the CPU, the DVD+/-RW, the DVD ROM, the HD and everything else. But after detecting the IDEs, a message showed up by saying that &quot;No keyboard detected&quot; then &quot;CMOS checksum error - Defaults loaded,&quot; and it forze up. I thought it was HD related, apparently it's not. Sorry if I can't get everything straight, I'm still a newb when it comes down to the hardwares. But any more detailed help would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Joe

6044	4	64055	762950	761745	Ray Harinec	2/14/05 5:05 AM	1.1083575E12	Sorry, I forgot to check	back on this thread. I would guess that you have continued trying things. The no keyboard MAY be that you haved a USB keyboard. Earlier systems would not detect a USB device until the Op Sys was up. Have you tried a new CMOS battery?? They are only a couple of bucks. The loss of the PS2 ports, both of them worry me because of the amount of handling the moving of the mobo caused. But is you can use USB keyboard and mouse, no big loss. Can you get into the BIOS or does it freeze before you can hit whatever key it takes to get in. Of course with no keyboard you can't push a key. Quite a quandry.

I am simply going to get another mobo regarding this problem, since this mobo is around 4 yrs old anyway. I saw one mobo that is suitable for AMD athlon XP made by PC Chips on Newegg.com. Can anyone verify for me if that board is considerable? B/c budget is a factor, and that board only cost around 24 bucks w/o shipping. Sincerely, Joe

6044	7	64055	764646	763280	Ray Harinec	2/14/05 6:33 PM	1.10840598E12	Used 4 PC chips mobos and AMD's .	in the last year. No real problems but it is NOT an overclockers mobo which is fine for normal use. [for their price , one wouldn't expect anything but a basic mobo]. They all came with the CMOS jumpers on the pins that keep the CMOS disabled. The manual is correct as far as the pin functions, just that they ship with the jumper in the wrong position. With the jumper in the wrong position, the power supply won't even turn on.
6044	8	64055	764965	764646	J.Y.C.	2/14/05 10:54 PM	1.10842164E12	THX	Thanks for the heads up. I have read all the reviews regarding this particular MB on Newegg.com, there were a lot of positive feedbacks but there were definitely some people just absolutely hated it. Well, it's too late for me to cancel the order now, since they have already shipped it out. And Newegg is known for their restocking fees. Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted when I get that new MB. Thanks for all the info by the way. Sincerely, Joe
