I know LCD's can't compare to regular monitors such as refresh rate and stuff. But do you guys know what are one of the best lcd's out there that wont have ghosting while playing games such as counter strike and among other pc games. Something that almost can match CRT monitors.

I'm looking for a good lcd that wont have ghosting and hopefully dead pixels which sucks if I get a couple of those. I dunno really, but i'm looking for 19 or maybe a little bigger than that. But a 32inch lcd?? Probably to big. But How good is it for gaming?
