Bob, I downloaded the driver and while the game can now be played, my regular display setting are distractingly massive.
How can I get my display (desktop picture, icon size and internet display, etc.
)to be the same size as before?
If I use system restore, will it take out the newly downloaded driver?
Is there another way to change the display?
Some of the page is so far off the screen that I can't even get to the arrow to move it across the page.
Sue
