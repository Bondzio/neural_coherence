i recently had a home wireless network installed by a technician.
it's a netgear router hooked to my dsl connection and has my dell desktop hardwired to it.
i also have a dell inspiron 9300 laptop with a wifi card and that connects perfectly to the network.
my problem is this.
my son is visiting for a few weeks and is having trouble hooking his apple powerbook to the network.
he can &quot;see&quot; the network named &quot;home&quot; but then he needs to enter a wep password to connect.
i do not know what password the technician used so i can't give it to my son.
unfortunately the technician is in south american for several months and i can't contact him.
does anyone know how i can figure out what password was originally set up?
