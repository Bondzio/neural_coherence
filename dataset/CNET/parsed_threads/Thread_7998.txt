<s> Hi there, I am trying to connect to the internet via the above router, following the steps in the manual and have reached a screen which wants me to enter primary and secondary DNS servers, but also gives me an option to get them automatically. </s>
<s> I tried to do so but it keeps returning to the same screen. </s>
<s> I called my ISP who advised me that giving me the numbers would do no good, but that I needed to change the settings of the router to automatically scan for them. </s>
<s> Is this right, and how do I do so? </s>
<s> I am at a loss for ideas now so any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But not enough detail about cable modem, DSL or fiber. </s>
<s> Yes, try the automatic DNS, DHCP all around like you do for cable but did ANYONE tell you to power off the cable modem for at least a ten count or during the time you move the ethernet cable from the PC to the new router? </s>
<s> If not, there's a missing step. </s>
