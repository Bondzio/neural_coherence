i had a dlink cable modem and a wireless g router.
it was a lot of trouble.
the modem to router connection failed a lot, a little power interruption and i would lose one or both and have to reset, i got a repeater but the signal still wasn't strong enough, the receivers on the other ends weren't satisfactory and seemed to fail a lot, the software was not &quot;great&quot;...... i could go on.
maybe it was all just my fault, it was new, i was new at it, and so on -- but i was still spending a whole lot of waking hours on just that alone.
this went on for a year untill i threw the modem and router away -- literally, in the trash!
i hated it sooooo much!
the linksys wireless g modem/router i got solved 98% of the difficulties.
if there's an electricity interruption or the infamous comcast cable &quot;blinks,&quot; i sometimes have to renew the connection/address.
otherwise it's a dream.
there were three people here a week ago, each using wireless laptops -- one a mac -- and there were no problems, no special software needed, no slowdown, etc.
-- and another home machine ran fine on wireless, too.
of course i would like 108mbps.
but i don't have it and it didn't appear necessary.
one last thing: no matter what you get, never, never, never get anything but a combonation modem/router.
otherwise, when there's a connection problem with a separate modem and router, you're trying to solve an equation with three possible variables.
