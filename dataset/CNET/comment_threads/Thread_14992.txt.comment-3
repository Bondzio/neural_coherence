i opened up my computer with it still running and put the case's temperature probe onto my graphics card processor (it has no heatsink) while not running a game.
it's temperature peaked at 92C or 198F Now that seams really hot to me, is this a normal temprature?
(my case started beeping and flashing so I would assume that this is extremely hot)
