Assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything, you can buy an enclosure for it for about $20 and connect to your computer via a USB cable. But then I don't know why WiFi would be a factor. If you're talking about connecting a PC to a network via WiFi, you can buy a USB adapter that does that nicely for as little as $10. Good luck.

I don't know how you could expect to connect a hard drive to that - I don't believe that's possible. Is this Airport Extreme some kind of server? Please elaborate.
