<s> first time in the forums, please forgive if i put this thread in a wrong place, or if i broke any rules i was transfering files into my microSD card, when my computer froze, and i had to manually turn off my computer. </s>
<s> when i turned it back on, i couldnt open the file, it said &quot;please insert a disk into Removable disk (H:)&quot; thinking it mus have been in another disk drive, i tried opening the other ones. </s>
<s> when that did not work, i safetly removed the card, and put it back in. </s>
<s> when that happened i got a message telling me that i had to format the microSD card, after clicking proceed, it told me that it could not format it and to check if it was a read only file, and to change it if it was i searched online and found out that to change it i have to go to properties&gt;general, and unclick &quot;read only&quot; only problem was that there WAS no &quot;read only&quot; button to click on. </s>
<s> even when trying to put it in my cell, it cant read it my other microsd cards work, so its not the drive i used a usb microsd card adapter for it, and there is no &quot;read only&quot; slide on my card. </s>
<s> how do i fix this problem? </s>
<s> please help &lt;&lt;to avoid any confusion i also posted this thread in another help site, but i got no solutions yet&gt;&gt; </s>
<s> I wish someone could reply to this post i am having the same problem. </s>
<s> I have heard to try to put it into a digital camera with a card adapter. </s>
<s> just thought i would share that </s>
