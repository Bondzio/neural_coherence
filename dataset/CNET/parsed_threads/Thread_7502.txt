<s> I have a Gateway 830GM. </s>
<s> Pentium 4. </s>
<s> Windows XP home. </s>
<s> After power failure when I push the big button the cd drive lights flash, the hard drive light is on and the processor fan kicks in as normal. </s>
<s> Usually the processor fan slows down and the monitor comes on and everything proceeds from there. </s>
<s> Now the processor fan runs on high without slowing. </s>
<s> The monitor never wakes up and the hard drive light stays on. </s>
<s> No sounds, nothing but the fan running at full speed. </s>
<s> I am plugged into a surge protector. </s>
<s> Thought it would help. </s>
<s> Tried unplugging the hard drive and plugging it back in. </s>
<s> Same with all the drives. </s>
<s> There is a little green light on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Is my processor fried? </s>
<s> How can I test it? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Yank out cord to psu and push power button, reconnect. </s>
<s> What fried, hmm, lots of things we can't tell by reading your picture. </s>

<s> Unfortunely, it could be anything. </s>
<s> The meer fact the HDs, etc. </s>
<s> spin-up suggests a possible cpu or ram module failure. </s>
<s> You didn't offer any beep sequence or such, thus you really can't trust anything. </s>
<s> If you got warranty, use it. </s>
<s> Disconnect all CD, HD drive cables to include power. </s>
<s> Try to reboot and if bios displays, enter it and allow only to boot from FD first device. </s>
<s> Use a bootable floppy. </s>
<s> If it does that, great add devices back-in. </s>
<s> If no display, then liekly cpu or mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself is at fault. </s>
<s> Posssble bad capacitors scenerio or bad p/s unit. </s>
<s> I suggest you test device on another system if possible(one at a time, only) and proceed from there. </s>
<s> No fancy, testing just swap and test. </s>
<s> Swap ram modules, install only one to see if that's it. </s>
<s> Any beeps, etc? </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
