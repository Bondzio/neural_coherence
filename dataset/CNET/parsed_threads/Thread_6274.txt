<s> Turned on my dual 2.0 yesterday morning and it went bang! </s>
<s> All initial thoughts pointed to the power supply, so I opened the case to see if I could see any evidence of component failure. </s>
<s> I've removed the power supply and nothing seems dead (looks and smell) but i saw this next to the combined fan/speaker arrangement. </s>
<s> &lt;img src=&quot; http://www.benlawrencephoto.co.uk/G5.jpg&quot; &gt; So the questions are: 1) what are these cables for, and should they be connected? </s>
<s> 2) If this cable disconnected itself and shorted with the case, would it damage the power supply or the logic board... or both. </s>
<s> I'm happy to replace the power supply, but I don't know if it is the power supply that's dead, or the logic board! </s>
<s> I'm having to do this myself as I can't afford to have it done professionally. </s>
<s> (i've built PCs for years, but not macs) ANY help you can offer would really help..... please? </s>
<s> looks like the Airport Extreme Antenna (Aerial) but the other is so blurred it could be anything. </s>
<s> I'll have a look in the Tech Manual this evening, another 12 hours, and see it I can locate it and its purpose. </s>
<s> Logic boards do not usually go &quot;Bang&quot; when they fail. </s>

<s> Even Apple was replacing these boards far out of warranty if you call it in. </s>
<s> Hint: If you find this, ASK. </s>

<s> Your shot was from a different angle than the one in the tech manual but I am confident that this is what they are. </s>
<s> However, if you have Wireless/Bluetooth installed on that machine, feel free to disagree Bob's theory on the capacitors is worth checking P </s>
<s> This is a really old posting, but not a single person referred to the issue of the G5 dual problems. </s>
<s> In a nutshell, do a search for &quot;g5 dual liquid-cooled leak&quot; or similar. </s>
<s> You will learn that almost ALL of the G5 dual models produced suffered liquid-cooled leaks. </s>
<s> This leak of a radiator-type fluid (toxic) would, in turn, fry the mother board. </s>
<s> Leading up to this would be inexplicable behavior including what seemed like software issues, locking up and, you guessed it, screaming fans. </s>
<s> There are a total of 6 fans in these models, so when the motherboard was glitching and running them all, it does sound like a jet! </s>
<s> Anyone experiencing this issue (even now...2010) should contact apple support and immediately ask for a supervisor. </s>
<s> This was a massive problem involving a multitude of macs; one which apple successfully &quot;handled&quot; on a case-by-case basis, thereby avoiding a massive recall. </s>
