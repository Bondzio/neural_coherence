<s> OK I BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER 5 YEARS AGO. </s>
<s> ITS AN HP PAVILION 6645C. </s>
<s> I HAVE DONE A FEW UPGRADES BUT I WANT TO UPGRADE THE PROCESSOR. </s>
<s> WHEN I BOUGHT IT HAD A 566MHz CELERON PROCESSOR, A MODEM, A CD-RW, NO VIDEO CARD AND 64MB OF RAM. </s>
<s> NOW IT HAS NO MODEM WHICH WAS REPLACED BY A NIC CARD FOR MY DSL CONNECTION. </s>
<s> IT HAS 384MB OF RAM AND A NEW NVIDA 64MB GEFORCE MX4000 VIDEO CARD. </s>
<s> I WANT TO UPGRADE THE PROCESSOR TO A NEW 1GHz CELERON OR A NEW PENTIUM 3 PROCESSOR. </s>
<s> WHAT A NEED TO KNOW IS IF MY MOTHERBOARD CAN HANDLE IT. </s>
<s> MY MOTHERBOARD IS COGNAC-F, AND I RECENTLY SAW ON A WEBSITE THAT THE MAX IT CAN HANDLE WAS 800MHz. </s>
<s> I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE SO THAT I WON'T BUY THE PROCESSOR WHICH WILL COST $45 WITH SHIPPING. </s>
<s> EMAIL PLZ ON YOUR INFO SINCE I DONT KNOW IF I WILL BE READING YOUR REPLYS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. </s>
<s> EMAIL ME AT res18zzb@hotmail.com </s>
<s> its not worth upgrading too...my oldest computer had a p3 1ghz and it suks so much more compared to my pentium 4...i would suggest investing a new pc already upgrade to 800mhz from 566mhz, u wont see much of a difference </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> First, I agree with NerdyBoy and Konny...it's not worth upgrading. </s>
<s> (Not to mention it can't handle anything above 800MHz!) </s>
<s> I have a four-year-old HP Pavilion 6736 (see my profile) which won't cut mustard anymore. </s>
<s> I bumped it up to 512MB RAM, a 60GB HD, and a CD burner so that I can use it as a test machine. </s>
<s> I rarely use it, and only to test programs or go to websites which I know will screw up my computer. </s>
<s> However, there are so many programs that it won't handle, I created a second partition on my primary system for testing as well. </s>
<s> Thus, I'm now looking for another use for my old 6736, most likely as a hardware firewall. </s>
<s> Since yours is even older yet, you only have a few options, and upgrading it so that it can remain your primary computer shouldn't be one of them. </s>
<s> Second, since you are new to the forums, I would like to point out that typing in all CAPS is considered shouting, and thus fairly rude. </s>
<s> In the future, please keep this in mind. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> That's a 50% boost, the mobo can't handle it. </s>
<s> However, it may handle this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819112141 </s>
