<s> Hi, I was thinking about getting a new laptop, mine is 5 years old: Dell 600m, Pentium m 1400 Mhz, 512mb Ram, Windows XP sp3. </s>
<s> But... </s>
<s> I ran my roomates laptop: Windows Vista, 2gb ram, Athalon 2.1Ghz I tested a macro in excel, a C++ and VB.net application and the results were.. excel was slower on the new laptop. </s>
<s> Also Vb.net and C++ applications were only 13% faster. </s>
<s> So it doesnt seem like upgrading is really worth it. </s>
<s> Only a benefit of 13% on speed? </s>
<s> Some reason excel was slower. </s>
<s> My question - I wanted to upgrade the Ram on my laptop. </s>
<s> At Dell.com there was only the option for 1Gb of ram and the specs were... </s>
<s> Type DRAM Technology DDR SDRAM Form Factor SO DIMM 200-pin Memory Speed 333 MHz ( PC2700 ) Module Configuration 128 x 64 1. </s>
<s> Can I use any Ram? </s>
<s> I wanted to have 2gb but Dell only has 1Gb available. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If I buy 1gb of ram can I just add this or would I need to remove the 512mb ram already installed? </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> Did you check crucial.com to see what RAM is available? </s>
<s> Oh yeah I just checked and there is only 1 type available. </s>
<s> I thought you could use any ram. </s>
<s> Do you know if it is a problem adding 1gb to 512mb exhisting or do I have to replace the 512mb. </s>
<s> I have 1 of 2 slots filled with 512mb currently. </s>
<s> It's why I just get it from Crucial for many machines. </s>
<s> I have XP on a few machines with 512MB and a few with 1GB. </s>
<s> One XP machine has 2GB but I can't say it's any faster as to computations due to the RAM. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> I have a simple, cheap dv6910us that I run VS2008 on. </s>
<s> I have this CRC routine that does some 4 billion CRCs in a little over 3 minutes. </s>
<s> I'm impressed. </s>
<s> then you'll have 1.5GB total. </s>
<s> Follow the installation instructions carefully...unplug from AC power and remove laptop battery before installing the RAM. </s>
<s> If possible, I'd put the 1GB SoDIMM in the first slot and the old 512MB SoDIMM in the 2nd slot. </s>
