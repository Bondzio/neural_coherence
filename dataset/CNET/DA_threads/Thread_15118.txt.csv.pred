1.1.1	Here is my layout : Cable modem to Switch Switch to both Windows Server 2003 AND Wireless Router Wireless Router to all intranet clients at my location ( it uses DHCP to assign IP addresses to the intranet clients ) This puts my server in front of the firewall for access to the world and all of my other clients behind the wireless routers firewall .	St
1.1.2	Here is my question : When I connect to my server from my intranet clients , the connections go out to the world and back again to my server .	St
1.1.3	I thought a switch was supposed to be smart enough to see the destination and route traffic directly down to the server .	St
1.1.4	What I 'm after is a way to transfer large files to/from my server at my local network speed ( not routing trough my cable modem ) .	St
1.1.5	Is there a way to do this without moving my server behind the wireless router 's firewall ?	Ques
1.1.6	TIA ... .	St
1.2.1	It might work if you paid for another IP address but it should not work .	St
1.2.2	Just asking .	St
1.2.3	Why not put said server into the DMZ ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	All depends on the IP addresses and the subnet masks .	St
1.3.2	Very technically it is the devices themselves that know they are on the same subnet and talk to each other directly using the mac address rather than the IP , the switch just carries the traffic .	St
1.3.3	To a point it is surprising this works .	St
1.3.4	Most cable companies will only allow a single device behind the modem .	St
1.3.5	If both machines are on the same subnet it should work as is you need to check the arp entries so ensure they are mapped .	St
1.3.6	If you can get into the switch you should also be able see what mac is learned on what port .	St
1.3.7	If they are on different subnets you can sometimes trick device into talking to each other by putting static arp entries in to map the ip to the mac .	St
1.3.8	Some router think they are smarter than you and give errors but many work .	St
1.3.9	Just a huge guess if it is working as you say I would say the cable company is running PPP .	St
1.3.10	This is a point to point protocol and assumes that all addresses are inside this PPP virtual interface and not on the real interface .	St
1.3.11	This means that even if the devices are on the same subnet the switch will not see the ARP messages because they are encapsulated inside of PPP .	St
1.4.1	My cable company allows multiple IP 's ( do n't ask me why - they just do - and I do n't wan na rock the boat and ask them & quot ; why & quot ; ) so both the server and the wireless router are assigned separate IP numbers by the cable company .	St
1.4.2	The IP 's for the 2 devices have the same first 3 bytes ( e.g .	St
1.4.3	xxx.xxx.xxx.yyy - the & quot ; xxx & quot ; 's are the same for each ) - so that should but them on the same subnet .	St
1.4.4	FYI - I 'm not a networking expert - but not a noob either .	St
1.4.5	Somewhere in the middle .	St
1.4.6	I do n't know about PPP , but I 'll read up on that and see if perhaps this could be the culprit .	St
1.5.1	You ca n't affect the routing without a lot more work and maybe some wifi router with some linux installed .	St
1.5.2	This is why I 'd skip all that by moving to the usual setup and place said server into the DMZ .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Replace the switch with a router .	St
1.6.2	The router will allows DMZ on one machine , and will route all traffic between your machines .	St
1.6.3	Mine with my web site server , two desktops , three laptops , all work behind my D-link DIR-655 Gigabit/wireless N router .	St
1.7.1	Hi .	St
1.7.2	Here is what is happening .	St
1.7.3	Intranet = Network 1 - N1 - 192.168.1.x Access Point + Router + ISP = Network 2 - N2 - 172.16.1.x 1 .	St
1.7.4	Your intranet is a separate network .	St
1.7.5	Lets say - 192.168.1.X .	St
1.7.6	2 .	St
1.7.7	It can access all other networks by connecting to the access points interface that is directly within this network - access points first IP - 192.168.1.1 3 .	St
1.7.8	To access all other networks and gain access to them , the packets have to go through the access points second interface - 172.16.1.X .	St
1.7.9	4 .	St
1.7.10	Problem - access point , acting as a router , will allow only common ports to transfer data from one interface to another .	St
1.7.11	Common ports 80 , 21* etc .	St
1.7.12	5 .	St
1.7.13	Now my question is - how are you transferring files ?	Ques
1.7.14	If you are using FTP then this problem seems queer .	St
1.7.15	Do you use FTP and try to connect to server using the IP address or the name ?	Ques
1.7.16	If you are using default file sharing , this might happen as ports used for file sharing are 135 to 139 and are blocked by default - rerouted through ISP .	St
1.7.17	6 .	St
1.7.18	So I need this information : a .	St
1.7.19	Method used by you to transfer files .	St
1.7.20	b .	St
1.7.21	Direction of file access - server to clients or clients to server ?	Ques
1.7.22	c. Function of the server .	St
1.7.23	If it is a server on the internet , then all that you have said makes sense .	St
1.7.24	Please elaborate .	St
1.7.25	Navneet .	St
1.8.1	Hi .	St
1.8.2	I want to add further information .	St
1.8.3	1 .	St
1.8.4	Please try to disconnect ISPs cable and see if you are able to proceed with file transfer .	Sug
1.8.5	2 .	St
1.8.6	DNS addressing may also be part of the problem here .	St
1.8.7	Navneet .	St
