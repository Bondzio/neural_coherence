Hey thanks for the information, I hadn't heard of a fault so never thought of it.
I've been in touch with intel about it and the support technician does not beleive this issue is related to that issue and told me to contact ASUS in regard to the SATA port issue to check if mine is one of the affected ones or not.
In regard to my current problem he reckons it sounds like a power issue.
