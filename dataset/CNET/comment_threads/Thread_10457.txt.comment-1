hello.
i need guide with my motherboard.
my spec is motherboard model-intel PG35EC processor-LGA 775 intel core 2 duo 3.0 GHz gfx-nvidia geforce fx8500GT 256 ram i just bought this new intel PG35EC motherboard.i used to install 4Gb ram(ddr 800mhz,1Gb for each slot,the motherboard have 4 slot for ram) on my old motherboard.
my new motherboard can support up to 8Gb ram(DDR 800/1066,4slot for ram) but when i installed these old rams,it did not boot up.
my pc only boot when i installed 2 ram(1Gb each) on 2 different slot.
It's quite a waste for the other ram.can anyone help me how can i fix this?
