<s> I would like to split the monitor signal from the computer (15 pin SVGA), with one going to a monitor that is hooked into a KVM switch, the other to an LCD t.v., which has a monitor capable input. </s>
<s> I initially tried this with a monitor Y cable, but the monitor behaved erratically, as if it wanted to turn on and off. </s>
<s> The LCD t.v. </s>
<s> looked normal, except it flashed some signal &quot;over size&quot; which I haven't yet investigated. </s>
<s> Would a video distribution amplifier, for a 15 pin monitor cable be available for sale? </s>
<s> One input, with two outputs? </s>
<s> I assume this would solve it. </s>
<s> Al </s>
<s> Any single video output going to two monitors will be supplying the same horizonal/vertical refresh and the same resolution. </s>
<s> Devices such as you mention will provide some isolation and signal attenuation but I don't see that to solve a problem where two different signals might be necessary. </s>
<s> You can run separate video cards or find one with multiple outputs that might suit you better. </s>
<s> Hope that helps but I cannot answer your question directly. </s>
<s> I forgot this portion.... </s>
<s> I'm running an HP a730n, with 512 Mb DRAM, XP. </s>
<s> Could you recommend a video card with dual outputs? </s>
<s> Would the original monitor output run independently from the video card outputs, so if/when using the KVM, the monitor signal from the computer would be visible on the LCD t.v.? </s>
<s> Al </s>
<s> I won't be able to recommend a specific card. </s>
<s> You can do a google search for dual display video to get some ideas of what is available. </s>
<s> If your PC motherboard has on board video, you will be limited to PCI cards. </s>
<s> It is possible to have more than one in a system. </s>
<s> I have a couple Radeon cards with both D-sub and DVI connectors. </s>
<s> These will run 2 displays but not at different resolutions. </s>
