Inspiron 1521 AMD Turion, 1.80 GHz 1918 mb ram Vista, Home Premium Zyxel P-330-W Router Cannon ip4300 Printer (on network) OK guys - I've been kicking around here ever since I first got my router back in late '07 - some days I think I'm getting it, and others - like today - I'm lost again.
Admittedly, I have more lost days than getting it days.
But I think I can verbalize my current confusion so that ya'll know that I'm a complete 'puter illiterate or I have one of my rare good questions - OK, here's why I'm confused.
If I want to print from my laptop, most days I can do so - however there are days when no matter what I do, I can't get anything to print from the laptop - The network printer has a USB connection to a Dell Dimension 2400, and there is never a problem printing from that machine.
What I don't understand is on the very best days for laptop printing, my Network and Sharing Center settings on the laptop say that there are no printers installed on that machine - that just don't seem right to me (seems to me that somewhere along the way in my research/learning, I thought I heard that you HAD to have the newest Vista print drivers installed in order for the network printer to function - isn't that a part of installing a printer?).
And yet, the very best functioning for my network printing come when there are no printers installed on my laptop.
I really don't like doing stuff that I don't understand, just because that's the only way it'll work - so I'd sure appreciate it if someone could explain to me why my laptop print function works best when there is no printer installed on the laptop - or if the truth is that I have just not yet discovered how to properly install the network printer on my laptop.
Many thanks to all (and I hope this was not a dumb-ass question!).
