I have installed a Pentium III 667 MHz processor (from an IBM 300PL-6584) into an IBM Aptiva 545 (2171-545) and get the error message &quot;CPU BIOS Update Code Mismatch) after booting. I tried getting a BIOS update floppy, but the computer will not even access the floppy before it gives this message nor will it allow me to enter the BIOS menu. The IBM 300PL accepted the Pentium III 450MHz processor (from the Aptiva 545) once the BIOS update had been completed. I contacted IBM and they told me that there shouldn't be any compatibility issues, so I am stuck as what to do. I've found forums on the net about that message, but only dealing with Acer PCs. I've gotten the newest BIOS update (6/30/2000) for the Aptiva and still no results. I also have put the old processor back and re-updated the BIOS, which has not helped yet. If anyone has any ideas as how to fix this issue, PLEASE let me know. ~SonChaser
