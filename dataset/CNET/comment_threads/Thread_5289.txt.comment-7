I see that marketing has done its job for you, audio processors DO NOT and WILL NOT increase game performance, and I don't give a hoot what Anand or creative's marketing literature tells us, you may see a marked performance increase of something like 4 FPS, which in real world means nothing to anyone The reason one purchases a sound card is to increase audio quality, not for gaming, and Creative dearly lacks audio quality The Audigy 2 is, compared to the Revolution, Riviera, or X-Plosion, a joke of a card, and while EAX 3+ may be &quot;oh so cool&quot;, name more than 10 games that can use it, that are presently on the market, have shipped any signifigant number of units, etc FEAR doesn't Doom 3 doesn't Half-Life 2 doesn't Oblivion doesn't FarCry doesn't Starcraft doesn't Warcraft III doesn't World of Warcraft doesn't Total Annihilation doesn't Everquest doesn't Counter-Strike/Counter-Strike: Source don't Unreal 2003/2004 don't thats more or less the biggest games of the last 5 to 10 years right there, the boards I reccomended all feature better quality, better prices, and for the naysayers, at minimum EAX 2 capability, yes, paying $200 for a Creative board just to get Creative's highly proprietary and buggy EAX platform for 3D gaming may be neat, but when we're talking drivers that will break at the drop of a hat, barely official Vista compatability, horrible Vista audio support, questionable XP stability, and a lock in to proprietary hardware and software...and we're paying $200 for this, NO THANK YOU And oh I know, the $80 X-Fi, thats a good response because its such a good &quot;value&quot;, however it won't post to Creative's performance &quot;level&quot; because it doesn't feature all of the extra garbage that X-Fi ships with (like onboard DRAM (worthless)) Additionally, I would NEVER consider THG a viable source for talking about audio quality, lets consider: Creative, hated by audiophiles and audio engineers everywhere for poor quality, poor drivers, and poor stability, along with a vastly overpriced and overinflated image of what a sound card should do, and unrealistic performance figures M-Audio, the industry standard for prosumer recording and playback operations, granted, M-Audio isn't Digidesign or Euphonix (far from it), but for the price nothing can compete with them, the Revolution 5.1 and 7.1 depart to a degree from this studio design basis, however still share some features with the Delta line, such as a commitment to affordable quality audio I'd say kid, but it would feel out of place, regardless, framerates, contrary to Futuremark's marketing, are far from life, framerates are what marketing execs and dried up husks of tech news websites want us to pay through the teeth for, they don't reflect anything in regards to the hardware.
Yeah, an X-Fi Elite [whatever other over the top marketing terms] may get 2 FPS higher than an M-Audio Revolution 7.1, it also costs about thrice as much, you'll never notice or see 2 FPS in the real world, EAX barely works so it isn't a valid competition point, and the M-Audio sports hardware S/PDIF out on the board, as well as 7.1 output, as well as equal DSP quality (or better), less power/heat, and a physically smaller package.
Sorry but Creative's marketing may be good, but isn't good enough to defy the laws of audio quality
