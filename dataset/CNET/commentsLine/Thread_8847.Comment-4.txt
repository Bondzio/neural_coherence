i'm running patriot ddr2/667 at 4-4-4-12 (spd is 5-5-5-15) in one pc and geil ddr2/533 in another.
from the mem tests i've tried and the reviews i've read, name brand ddr2 with spd of 533: 4-4-4-12 will run at 667: 4-4-4-12. the benchmark difference is slight at best (less than 5%).
so, your corsair/transcend should be fine at ddr2/667.
don't know what your budget is, but hexus.net gave your tuner a so-so review.
but at the $50 price point, i 'spose that's expected.
