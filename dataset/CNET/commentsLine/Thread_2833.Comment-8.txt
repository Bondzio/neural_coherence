router uses the ip of 192.168.1.1 it may br conflicting with the netgear router.
log in to the westell router.
if you cannot, run belarc advisor and see what the ip for the westell is.
if it is 192.168.1.1 then change the netgear router to 192.168.7.1 and it should solve the problem.
hope this helps.
