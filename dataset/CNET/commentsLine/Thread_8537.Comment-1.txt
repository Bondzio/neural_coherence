ok guys um i have a hp pavilion 6645c series comp.
its 5 years old now and i think my hd is failing now.
my comp is now freezeing with regulatory time.
problem is i have to buy windos xp if i buy a new hd.
but what im wondering most about is what hd is perfect for this comp?
if you know post it.
the motherboard is a cognac, don't ask me i can't find anything about this motherboard, well from the company that made it.
i have a intel celeron 566mhz processor, 15gb hd, with win98.
i have 384mb ram, and a 64mb nvidia graphics card.
