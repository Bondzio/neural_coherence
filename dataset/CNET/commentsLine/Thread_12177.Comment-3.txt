i am currently a student in high school.
i plan on studying landscape design, so this mb is only to get me threw high school.
when in college i plan on buying the macbook pro.
i do like music, would like to edit photos, and do other things.
i currently own one pc, while my parents own another.
i guess i'm what you call a switcher.
i may still be looking into the macbook pro though, as it's something i can afford if wanted.
i travel about 4 to 5 times a year on vactions, family visits, etc.
but if anyone can help me out on this thanks.
also, since i'm talking about the macbook pro is it really worth the extra $500 for screen space, faster processer, backlit keyboard, better graphics card, video memory, etc.
i may want to get into some gaming, so this is just something for me to consider.
thanks again everyone.
