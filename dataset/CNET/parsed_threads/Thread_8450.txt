<s> As noted; I have a G5 PPC operating with OS X 10.5.8. </s>
<s> I am wanting to use a microphone plugged into the Audio Line-In Port on the rear of the computer. </s>
<s> Can you offer a suggestion as to what manufacturer and model does a nice job of laying down a voice track (no singing involved). </s>
<s> According to the Power Mac G5 Guide this microphone would need to be a &quot;self-powered&quot; mike. </s>
<s> Which leads to a secondary question of why did Apple include a &quot;non-self-powered&quot; mike with the computer? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> If the mic, that was included with your computer, came from Apple, then it should work. </s>
<s> What makes you think it is a &quot;non-self-powered&quot; mic? </s>
<s> If probably has a longer than usual connector (pin) on it and draws its power from inside the socket. </s>
<s> Did you try it? </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Everything else works but the mic. </s>
<s> Even a poor quality Mic that I don't want to use. </s>
<s> mrmacfixit How do they work? </s>
<s> Just connect and use?? </s>
<s> I want to use this to lay a voice sound track in iMovie and that only offers the &quot;Built in Audio&quot; as a source for this voice over? </s>
<s> Does this become another choice or do I need to make some setting changes somewhere? </s>
<s> Is there one you would recommend? </s>
<s> I have a Logitech headset with mic. </s>
<s> You just connect it to the USB port and it becomes an option in the sound preference pane. </s>
<s> Quality is very good, for a headset, but there are much better ones out there. </s>
<s> Think I paid around $15 for them. </s>
<s> Google for USB microphone or take a look at the Logitec site P </s>
<s> Thank you much. </s>
<s> Will look into that. </s>
<s> This may get a little stupid sounding but your headset; what is it for? </s>
<s> Can the system react both ways (audio in & audio out) through the USB? </s>
<s> I use the headset for Skype, iChat and on-line Flight Simulation. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Didn't realize there were so many reasons for a headset. </s>
<s> Looked at Logitech headset and mike on MacConnection, saw about 26 reviews on this item, 20 gave it rave review with 15 making it 5 out 5 star and the others 4 out 5. </s>
<s> They used for reasons you sited and some gaming. </s>
<s> Guess I need to get out a little more. </s>
<s> Going to order a Logitech later today. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> MRmacfixit Bought a Logitech Clear Chat Comfort headset and mic and it is sensational. </s>
<s> Can't understand what's not to like. </s>
<s> Problem solved. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> Thank you Enjoy P </s>
<s> Ay, I see that you found how Apple stuck it to its customers, once again, you would think a higher priced computer would out shine a M$ machine. </s>
<s> The port on the Mac is for in-line (powered sources) only, no 'regular' mic will work. </s>
<s> You will need a usb mic or an external mic input via usb. </s>
