hi there!
i am in canada and buying a new pc.
this is the quote i got from a local pc builder.
since i am new to all this, i thought i'd ask all you experts if it was a good deal or not.
background info first.
i have always had a pentium, dell because i got the epp dell discount throught work.
i use my pc every day for work functions, (word, excel) as well and the internet, download dvd's, music, photos.
my hubby wants a decent system to play some games but nothing too fancy.
i am looking for upgradability as well as speed.
right now if i have word and internet up at the same time, system crashes.
not sure if i should go for dual core amd or pentium (definitely want dual core).
here is the quote (in cdn dollars): system configuration: processor - intel pentium d930 3.0ghz - 800mhz fsb 4mb mainboard - asus p5ld2 s775 i945p chipset 1066mhz pci-ex16/3+1pci/4ddr2, w/sound gb-lan sata raid usb 2.0 memory - corsair vs1gbkit533d2 1gb kit 2x512mb ddr2 533mhz floppy - peri power 32-in-1 memory card reader w/2xusb,1x1394 black cdrw drive - lg gsa-4167bb/bk 16x16 dl dvdrw w/software hard drive - wd wd2500ks 250gb 16mb sata ii video card - evga e-geforce 7600gt 256m ddr pci-e (256-p2-n553-ax) sound card - sound blaster audigy 2 zs 7.1 (oem) network card - marvell 88e8053 pci-e gb lan controller modem card - acer rockwell 56k v92 pci modem casing - sonata ii 17'' black atx w/450w ps (8xbays) monitor - lg 19'' l1932tx-bf 1280x1024 1400:1 4ms bk dvi lcd keyboard/mouse - logitech cordless desktop s510 media remote kb & mouse combo speakers - creative inspire 5.1 p5800 5 speakers w/subwoofer software - windows xp media center 2005 edition oem (cd,manual & license) printer - lexmark x3350 - multifunction ( color ) - ink-jet - copying (up to): 15 ppm (mono) / 9 ppm (color) - printing (up to): 22 ppm (mono) / 15 ppm (color) - 100 sheets - usb other - ms office 2003 basic edition (word, excel outlook) other - ap system installation service and ap standard system manufacture warranty (1 yr parts & 3 yrs service) $2321 plus tax.
is this good, bad, overkill for our needs?
any components you'd swap for others?
thanks so much for all who chose to reply.
i am very grateful!
