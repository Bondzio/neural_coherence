thanks, that's pretty much the lines upon which i'm thinking now.
i'm going to pick up an e8500, which should last me a while, especially if i decide to overclock.
in a year or two when quad cores are cheaper and have higher clock speed, i'll switch over to one of those.
as far as i7 / non lga775 goes, well, that'll have to wait until my next build.
especially since i'm definitely not messing with that ddr3 ram yet.
