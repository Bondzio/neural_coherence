okay, so i just bought this used custom computer from this guy on craigslist, and it looks pretty decent.
however, he has a 9200 ati in it and i wanna put in a 8800 (i finally got $300 to buy it).
is it possible to check what graphics slot you have without opening up the case, cause it looks like a hassle (it's a water cooled case which looks like it would take and hour or so to open up).
also, he dosn't know what kind of port it has because his dad bought it for him.
just a side note, he's my specs: manufacturer: intelr processor: intel(r) pentium(r) 4 cpu 2.40ghz memory: 1024mb ram hard drive: 80 gb video card: radeon 9200 pro family (microsoft corporation) monitor: plug and play monitor sound card: realtek ac97 audio speakers/headphones: kinyo surround sound keyboard: usb root hub mouse: logitech cordless mx 7000
