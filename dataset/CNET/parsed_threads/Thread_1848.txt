<s> Hello, I have my home PC using Windows ME, and my works laptop using Windows 2000 on my wireless network at home (linksys). </s>
<s> I'm trying to get these systems to file share between them. </s>
<s> Problem is I need to keep my laptop on my works domain; I can't swtich my network ID to &quot;workgroup.&quot; I tried searching at linksys, but no luck. </s>
<s> Is there any other way to get this to work? </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> -Thnx </s>
<s> Make sure you ME machine uses the same network client. </s>
<s> Set up the shares/permissions normally. </s>
<s> You should also require a username/password for your ME machine. </s>
<s> The workgroup name should not matter. </s>
<s> When you attempt to access the laptop, you should be presented with an interactive login box. </s>
<s> You will need to enter a valid user and password. </s>
<s> To see how you are logged on, press CTRL-Alt-Del and the box will say how you are logged on. </s>
<s> Use that full login name as the user and the password will be the one you log on to the laptop with. </s>
<s> You are logging onto the laptop and not your work domain. </s>
<s> I have a similar situation and my work laptop is part of a domain as well. </s>
<s> I need to be able to transfer and share data from my home PC and this is how I set mine up. </s>
<s> I was able to do this with Win98 but now have XP-Pro. </s>
<s> It should work with ME. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Both are setup on Client for microsoft networks. </s>
<s> Share/permissions are setup, and I have a username/password setup for my ME machine. </s>
<s> However, I can't access the laptop. </s>
<s> I've tried going to start &gt; run and using every combination of user name, password, machine name I could think of, but no go. </s>
<s> Am I trying to access the laptop incorrectly? </s>
<s> I can't see it on my network at all. </s>
<s> Maybe it's a ME thing, which wouldn't surprize me. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. </s>
