I went to their site and was so impressed I purchased the Pro version.
Sharpwitz, Geeks.com sells a diagnostic kit that traces the codes during POST for under $30.
This gadget installs on a PCI slot.
It comes with a booklet containing all the code definitions.
It's helped me a few times.
Between the two of them you should be able to isolate the problem.
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
and life goes on... Jack
