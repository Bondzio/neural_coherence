I don't think a sound card was ever installed on this device, it's a hand-me-down but it's in great condition. When I go to the volume control it tells me that &quot;no active mixers are installed&quot;. I've installed the drivers from the ASUS website but an error pops up during install, &quot;no audio device on HD detected&quot; (or something like that). I think my only way of getting sound off this thing without having to send it back to ASUS might be an external sound card (USB) but I know absolutely nothing about them. Do they work? Does it basically replace what should have been installed on the motherboard? Thanks in advance for help, you guys rule.

Almost all HD audio solutions have us install the MS UAA (yes that's a google for you) driver first from the machine or motherboard maker BEFORE the audio driver. It seems either the documentation omits this important step or people don't read said docs. Bob
