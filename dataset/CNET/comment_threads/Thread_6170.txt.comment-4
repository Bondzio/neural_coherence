Just checked my sons HP computer that I know is 10/100 and it too shows Gigabit in the device manager.
I can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100.
I can do the same on my Dell that I know is Gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0Gbps.
As I said on my previous post, PCI 10/100/1000 NIC cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play.
I would definitely go that route because you will know everything is Gigabit and no gray areas.
I believe I paid $22.00 or $23.00 for the last one I bought at Staples.
You can actually get them cheaper online, but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time.
