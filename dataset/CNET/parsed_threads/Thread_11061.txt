<s> I wrote the following in another forum, but I believe I've posted in the wrong one. </s>
<s> I do hope someone can help. </s>
<s> I'm new to the forums, but have posted two questions in the past and received some excellent (and I might add, ever so grateful) advice-help. </s>
<s> Well it seems I'm in need of advice once again. </s>
<s> I need to purchase a video card, but my head is spinning from a weird mass of terminology! </s>
<s> I do know and understand that it must be AGP. </s>
<s> Now my motherboard manual (ASUS P3B-F) states that &quot;AGP bus frequencies above 66MHz exceed the specifications for the AGP interface and are not guaranteed to be stable&quot; I only need a basic, low cost card. </s>
<s> So the one I'm looking into is as follows. </s>
<s> Would this be a compatible card? </s>
<s> Pine SiS 315E Video Card / 32MB / AGP 4X Performance GPU/VPU SiS 315E RAMDAC 375 MHz Maximum Resolution Learn More 2048 x 1536 @ 85Hz Memory Video Memory 32MB Memory Type SDRAM Core Clock 166 MHz Memory Clock 143 MHz Memory Bandwidth 2.7GB/sec. </s>
<s> Connections Interface Type AGP Interface Speed 4X Connector(s) VGA System Requirements Operating Systems LINUX Windows 2000 Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows ME Windows NT Windows XP </s>
<s> Without knowing anything about the motherboard (tried digging up some info but no luck). </s>
<s> Assumed this MB has a AGP slot, I would think this video board should be OK. AGP 4X should be backward compatible. </s>
<s> You didn't mention the price for the card you listed. </s>
<s> Be good to know. </s>
<s> Nowdays there might be a good 64MB card around for the same price. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
