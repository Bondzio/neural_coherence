to be sure it is installed properly, your brother must have tried it, so it seems logical to me he showed you that it worked correctly and how to use it.
i assume it isn't a flash drive, but something with a (rather large) hard disk inside.
and i assume it's just a drive letter (maybe d:, maybe g:) in my computer.
so saving or moving anything to it can be done by selecting the g:-drive in stead of the c:-drive.
and you can move or copy anything to it using my computer or windows explorer like you copy or move to any other drive.
hope this helps.
