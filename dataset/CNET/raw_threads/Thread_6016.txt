The users should possible not be affected with the connecttion to the wifi network. How can I go about it?

Some commercial AP have the ability to add multiple SSID to the same vlan. You could then run in parallel for a while and tell your uses to use the new one and then remove the old. A couple of brands of AP actually have a feature that allows you to not allow new sessions to a SSID but leave it active.
