hi, sciencebook.
it's arguable (very) whether it's better for you to keep it on or off.
but in terms of energy demand (and we're going back into what was once called an &quot;energy crisis&quot;) and global warming, the answer is simple -- turn it off!
furthermore, if you're on a network or broadband, the increased risk of someone sneaking in an open port and doing nasty things with the computer again outweigh the arguable benefit in longevity.
