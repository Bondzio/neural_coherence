I cannot get one of the wireless desktops to pick up an IP address. I get the default address and the limitied connectivity warning when trying to connect. I have switched everything between the two pcs with the same result (endlessly). I have the MAC address specified in the router, auto IP config and WPA set. There is no firewall on the pc atthe moment. Out of patience!! Any thoughts??

It appears that having other working laptops is not a valid test that the firmware is good. Also I'm running into the SSID disabled issue too much now. I leave it to others to figure out why SSID must be enabled for some laptops to connect. Bob
