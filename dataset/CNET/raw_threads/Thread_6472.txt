I have a Dell dem. 8400 running xp Pro wirh all the updates. When I go to burn jpgs. to DVD everything is fine until I click on Make Compatable. It starts then I get a blue stop screen.If I don't click Make compatiable I can open the files on my computer but it does not work on others. If I remember correctly I did not have this problem a few months ago. I reinstalled my Sonic software but that did not help. Any ideas? Thanks

It's just a start but it means that you installed some other software to enable using the media as a big floppy. Try this. Uninstall that software and then reinstall this plus what updates they offer. Bob

DLA is a form of formatting that enables the optical drive to work like a big hard drive or floppy disk. When you &quot;copy files&quot; to the optical drive you are burning them but they will only work on that PC. That &quot;Make Comatable&quot; option is supposed to make the optical disk compatable with other PCs. It's not. As Bob said, uninstall it or use standard burning techniques. Do you have a burning program?
