<s> every time i play a game either Need for Speed Carbon collectors Edition or Age of Empire's 2 my computer restarts after 30 minutes or so, its getting to be a pain, i have a AMD 3000+, 2.07 GHZ, 1 GB of ram, Radeon 9800SE, Windows XP Service Pack 2 (Build 2600), i don't know what to do anymore if someone has any tips in now to fix it i would appreciate it, thanks in advance.... </s>
<s> Try a simple test. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover. </s>
<s> If it lasts longer proceed to the usual dust bunny and lint removals from heatsinks and replace any vibrating or broken fans. </s>

<s> thanks for the info bob, i cleaned all the dust and made sure nothing was loose but it still crashed, this time it crashed after about an hour or so, i know theres an issue with Carbon, theres articles on the game crashing for people so that could be a game problem until the patch comes out, but age of empire has worked for me perfect in the past , don't know why it keeps on crashing </s>
<s> Now find a fan to point at the open machine. </s>
<s> Does it run even longer? </s>
<s> If so, there can be a cooling issue or some part has become heat sensitive. </s>
<s> There are also cases where the power supply has aged and we fit a new bigger one. </s>
<s> But the exact item to replace hasn't been found yet. </s>
<s> Try a big fan... Bob </s>
<s> I developed a problem a while back with an old AMD Duron that I had. </s>
<s> Whenever I played intensive games, shut down and turned the computer on afterwards, the power lights would go on but it wouldn't boot up. </s>
<s> I took it to the tech shop and it turns out that the fan/heatsink I had was inadequate to properly cool the processor. </s>
<s> The fact that the games run for half an hour and simply crash really makes me think it is a heating issue. </s>
<s> yesterday i was using my computer then all of a sudden it restarted, i went to administrative tools/services i check there was an error Details Product: Windows Operating System Event ID: 7023 Source: Service Control Manager Version: 5.0 Component: System Event Log Symbolic Name: EVENT_SERVICE_EXIT_FAILED Message: The %1 service terminated with the following error: %2 i have no idea what this means, and if it is a heat issue, i need to pay a visit to a tech store. </s>
<s> Varied to the point of meaningless. </s>
<s> The only meaning I get from them is that the PC needs repair. </s>
<s> Sadly there are a lot of badly made PCs out there. </s>
<s> Some are assembled improperly without heatsink compound. </s>
<s> (A favorite find of mine.) </s>
