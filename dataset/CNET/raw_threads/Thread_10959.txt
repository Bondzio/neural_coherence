I run a DVD movie and after 10 - 15 minutes I recieve an error message saying that I am out of memory. Do I need to install more memory just to watch DVD movie and how much? Thanks

My answer is it sounds like a software issue. 3. &quot;I have an new computer...&quot; You have a WARRANTY issue. A new machine shouldn't develop such an issue when new. I suggest you contact the maker and make it their problem. If you want to solve it, be sure to post in a Software or OS Forum that matches. Note the OS, the DVD player software and versions of everything. I can play DVD on my 256 Meg RAM PC with either Windows 98 or XP, so I think it's not a RAM or hardware issue. Bob
