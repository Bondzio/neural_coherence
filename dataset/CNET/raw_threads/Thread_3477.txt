Hello ALL, I could really use a computer, but I don't know if I should wait until X-mas sales. I would really like an HP high performance computer. Should I wait for prices to tumble so I could get a quad core, or should I just get a dual core, probably AMD now? I'll probably try and get 3gb ram, 500gb hdd, tv tuner, wireless, maybe a 19&quot; widescreen. I want to render images, use CAD, and do other engineering related items. ANY THOUGHTS?? tHANKS

Will it be worth it? Or do you think that average person/engineering student would really benefit that much from a quad core? Also, why would you strongly recommend only 2gb ram? I will probably just run vista home premium. Thanks for the reply!!

During this time, offers will come and go, peaking at Xmas. If you can wait, the deals, sales, reductions, etc., should be numerous it is worth it. Up to you. tada -----Willy

Those that dare to run 64-bit Windows encounter issues you can research later. But here's the quick reasons for just 2GB. 1. Windows limits application memory to 2GB. 2. Even with the /3GB switch (see XP 3GB on google...) the application must be compiled with a special switch or it still is limited. 3. Read posts about XP 4GB to see that some experience slower speeds with 4GB installed. Today I advise to stop at 2GB unless you have done more research or will not complain about the known issues. Bob

There are some great deals on new items being returned and it seems like the retailer are always unloading inventories that were not sold before Christmas. Good Luck

These will NOT have a graphics card and will have one to two cores and 512mb to 3 gb ram. If you find a deal like the Gateway quad-core Gt 5628 (best buy has this week) I'd get it. Specs: Core 2 Quad Q6600, 3gb DDR2, 500gb H.Drive, Nvida Geforce 8500gt graphics card and a DVD/Cd burner Get it with the Samsung 2232bw 22&quot; mon. and an Hp F4180 AIO for around $1250. Ends today however!

So, I was just wondering since you said USED TO WORK, did you really have that many high performance machines at your store. I mean, the high performance machines coming out now, I believe but could easily be mistaken, are a fairly new thing. I would think that bb or cc would have sales on all of there stuff around the holiday season. thanks again in advance!

(refer to my first post for type of computers that will be found on sale). And yes, bb and cc (I have worked for both) has carried high performance computers. bb once carried alienware and now has velocity micro and cc could do a build-to-order high performance computer and also now carries velocity micro. Yes, the vast majority of retail computers don't have a dedicated graphic card (they have alway had one or two) but most of those customers don't play games and don't want to spend 1100 to 5000 on a computer configured to play them. Though check out the new acer (5630) that has a radeon hd 2400 for 750.00. You could alway build your own. Check out tomshardware.com for ideas on low, mid and high cost gaming computers. good luck!
