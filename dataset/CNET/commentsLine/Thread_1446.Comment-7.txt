i'm kind of desperate to get a video back so i can access my files so i'll give it a try.
i'm in some sort of dialogue with hp and have filed complaints with the bbb in their area but that's not helping me get anything done.
i'd appreciate it if you could let me know how you got yours working.
thanks.
