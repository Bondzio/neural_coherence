Yeah, Olympus was one of my 1st digital cameras.
I have had other newer digital cameras; but Olympus was always my back-up.
It was very dependable.
The last picture for my trip is when the card &quot;went south&quot; on me.
I have a nice Nikon CoolPix that I like; but I wasn't going to take that out into the woods with a hundred 6th graders.
I took my old back-up, the Olympus.
In retrospect I guess that Olympus was an old-timer.
Thank you so much for the quick response.
