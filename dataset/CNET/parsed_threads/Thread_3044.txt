<s> My son recently gave me his computer and i am cvery happy and very grateful,however there is one problem. </s>
<s> the hard drive (c) is absolutely full of dross i.e. </s>
<s> bits of uninstalled programs and such like. </s>
<s> i have used registry mechanic and although it reports that i have 468 errors on my drive it will only repair 29 of them,as have a few others i have tried, therefore my question is this, can anyone recommend a good free program that will actually repair the errors as well as finding them? </s>
<s> thank you for taking the time to read this, and for any help you may offer </s>
<s> what kind of errors are being noted? </s>
<s> If it's just crosslinked files and such, the OS (what is it?) </s>
<s> may have a built in utility. </s>
<s> If it's actual bad sectors, the remedy is different or not available. </s>
<s> In worst cases, you can erase the drive with a utility from the manufacturer that will do a sector by sector surface analysis. </s>
<s> Some can &quot;move&quot; unrecoverable sectors to spare ones. </s>
<s> This process marks bad spots so they will not be made available when you partition and format the drive. </s>
<s> One small program that's supposed to do miracles is called &quot;Spin Rite&quot;, as I recall, but it's not free and will cost as much as today's 80 gig drives. </s>
<s> reformat that box just grab a legal copy of your favorite OS (Linux or Windows) and reformat it'll solve all the hastles </s>
