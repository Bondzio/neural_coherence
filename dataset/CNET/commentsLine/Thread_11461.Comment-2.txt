1. i went both vga and hdmi from my laptop and it's working fine.
sadly i find many challenged by this setup.
another member pointed out this new dell box -&gt;  not a bad idea.
sorry i don't own one as i use a laptop for that position.
2. i just picked up a hp c4780 wifi printer and yes it works and yes it was a pain in the net to set up.
yes i got it working but after 4 hours i was about to pack it up until i thought it over one more time.
it appears it was having trouble with the 802.11n router.
i guessed and set the router to 802.11g mode and now it's ok. but there's a new lesson here.
