If I write up a bunch of papers on a pc will it be easy to get it to the mac? and vice versa? Do saved documents on a mac transfer to a pc without great effort? I've heard that there are isn't a whole lot of software that's compatible with both machines, I might be wrong though. Does this mean I'll have to get completely different software that can't 'communicate' with my friends who own pc's? I'm looking in to buying a mac so I'd like to know how easy it's gonna be to mesh with the rest of the world.

Also, almost all usb stick drives, card readers, memory cards, ext-hdds connect to Mac computers, so sharing other files is easy too. Just don't worry about it. Even if what I said here doesn't work, you will find a way.
