Good suggestion, I'll swap the monitors around see if the problem follows with the monitor.
It's probably not heat related, since it starts happening from a cold system.
I have four 120mm case fans, and the graphic card has its own enclosed cooling fan.
CPU is water cooled and I think it could make ice cubes if asked to do so.
This is a totally new system less than 6 months old.
It has a 850 watt PSU, so it's probably getting enough power.
I'll swap the monitors around, and check for new display drivers, and see what happens.
If I had a spare graphics card I would give that a try, but that darn FireGL 7350 broke the bank, So far, all ATI has offered, was to send me links to their trouble shooting pages.
Thanks for your help
