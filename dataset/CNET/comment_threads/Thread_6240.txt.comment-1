I had a Maxtor 80g HD in my old Win98SE machine (1Ghz, 748Mb RAM).
It was partitioned 40g/40g.
I added a 2nd Maxtor 80g HD as Master & set the old one to Slave.
I installed WinXP-home on the new C: drive, and when it was 100% working, I copied all data from the (40/40) D: drive to my new C: (side note: I found I could switch boot order in the BIOS & boot to either W98 or WinXP ) I then erased the data & the 2nd partition on the 40/40 D: & used the XP Disk Management to reformat it.
My problem is the D: 40/40 now reads as a 40g HD !
Nothing I have been able to do can correct this, even the BIOS autodetects it as 40 !
Help ?
