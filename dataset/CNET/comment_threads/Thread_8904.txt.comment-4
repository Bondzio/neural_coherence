Thanks guys, if it were for my personal use I'd take your offers, but this is for a customer who would expect a brand new product, not used.
I did find an internal SCSI drive from Adtron which uses Compact Flash media ( http://www.adtron.com/products/Sdds.html ), but I need an external drive.
I looked for a drive enclosure for SCSI, but all are either IDE, USB or SATA.
The SCSI drive enclosures I saw were not the right form factor ... bummer.
