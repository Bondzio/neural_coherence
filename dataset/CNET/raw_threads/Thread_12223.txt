When I put it into sleep mode, it starts again after a minute or two. Some times it just starts a second after it goes to sleep. Thats very frustrating since I use the sleep mode a lot. Im running a Norwegian Windows 7 Professional... Can that be a problem?

Home users usually are (blissfully) unaware that we can't install Windows without hunting for The Install Plan for this machine. I do not have The Install Plan for this machine (Dell or AlienWare has it) but here's My Generic Install Plan with added note for Windows XP. 1. Install the OS. 2. Install the motherboard chipset driver. 3. If XP and required install MSUAA (see google) 4. Install the Audio driver. 5. Install the Video driver. 6. Install Lan, wifi drivers. 7. If a Dell, may required the Quickset software. 8. Install protection suite. Bob

I tried to power down using the power button when this kept happening, which also wouldn't work so I then pulled out the power cord. I waited about ten seconds and put the cord back in. I did not press any buttons and my Alienware turned it's self on right as the power was restored and 'came out of sleep' skipping the loading screen and going directly to my desktop reviewing my notepad documents that I had open before previously taking the power cord out. Seems like Alienware has some sleep issues, or the systems are possessed.
