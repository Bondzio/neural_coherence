<s> I am putting together a new computer: ASUS P7H55-M LE mobo Intel i3-550 CPU Corsair XMS3 4GB ram Seagate Barracuda 1T HDD Liteon 24X DVD/CD writer Ultra 600W PSU All is assembled and plugged in, including the DVD/CD writer and the hdd. </s>
<s> I am now testing hardware (Ubuntu live disk in the drive), and the system begins startup. </s>
<s> It gets as far as giving the message: &quot;Reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key&quot; Rebooting returns the same message. </s>
<s> Same results with both Win 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 disks. </s>
<s> Going into BIOS set up and looking at SATA devices shows nothing on SATA 1 (HDD) and on SATA 2, &quot;[ATAPI iHAS524 ] (the Liteon). </s>
<s> The HDD does not show up in the list because the power connectors will not reach the HDD (thank you Ultra!) </s>
<s> and I have an extender power cable on order. </s>
<s> First question is should the lack of an operative HDD keep the CD from booting up? </s>
<s> I think not, but just want to eliminate the obvious. </s>
<s> Second, what would keep the Liteon from loading the Ubunutu CD? </s>
<s> (I don't have another SATA optical drive to substitute test.) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> One would imagine that booting from an iso that boots in another computer, and from a genuine Windows CD would be sufficient. </s>
<s> But just on the off chance that both might be &quot;dodgy&quot; for this computer, I tried another CD (this a genuine Ubuntu CD) and it booted right up. </s>
<s> I think that problem is solved, but I'll come back if any further hiccups. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Further to the above regarding SATA power extension cable, I hope I have ordered the right one. </s>
<s> What is the number of pins on the SATA cable that goes in to the back of an optical drive or a HDD? </s>
<s> I hope it is 15. </s>
<s> Maybe a better question is, &quot;Should I get a SATA female to male extender? </s>
<s> Is there any advantage over a molex female to SATA male extension?&quot; </s>
