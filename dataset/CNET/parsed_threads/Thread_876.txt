<s> i have looked on the web for 30 mins and i cant find anything about how to open my dell inspiron 560 MT please can someone helpp me its about a year old now and i what'd to clean the fans thanks </s>
<s> Most newer desktops from Dell, open one of two ways, either push a button for release mechanism, then open like a clam -OR- pull on some spring-loaded latch and allow side covers to fall or grab and pull away. </s>
<s> Your model does it one of those ways, unless some screw(s) is holding it back but that's would be obvious, I hope. </s>
<s> Remove screw(s) and then apply the above latch mechanisms. </s>
<s> While that all sounds easy, at times, because of the tightness or dust build-upo, etc., you may have to play with it. </s>
<s> You get the idea once it's revealed to you. </s>
<s> Also, you can surf the Dell support website and locate your model# and check for replacement of some part. </s>
<s> usually, some generic info is provided for disassemby for int. </s>
<s> access. </s>

<s> Found it in under a minute on the dell site. </s>
