<s> I have been trying to find the source of Packet Loss between my computer and another PC IP address. </s>
<s> I am able to Ping and Tracert to this address all OK without any problems showing up. </s>
<s> However, when I use Pathping to determine if there is any packet loss along the 11 Hop route, the output information shows 100% Loss at hops 5 through 9, even though the target IP shows 0% Loss. </s>
<s> Are the 5 routers blocking the Pathping test? </s>
<s> Is there any way to get Pathing to work normally? </s>
<s> Here are the results of Ping, Tracert, and Pathping: ping 24.189.11.202 Pinging 24.189.11.202 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=23ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=22ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Ping statistics for 24.189.11.202: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 17ms, Maximum = 23ms, Average = 19ms tracert 24.189.11.202 Tracing route to ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] over a maximum of 30 hops: 1 5 ms 5 ms 5 ms 10.22.152.1 2 7 ms 6 ms 5 ms vl4.aggr1.nyw.ny.rcn.net [209.122.64.225] 3 7 ms 7 ms 5 ms ge3-0.border3.nyw.ny.rcn.net [207.172.15.68] 4 6 ms 7 ms 6 ms r3-ge2-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [198.32.118.17] 5 8 ms 6 ms 5 ms r1-srp1-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [65.19.97.97] 6 8 ms 7 ms 7 ms 451be0a2.cst.lightpath.net [65.19.96.162] 7 15 ms 13 ms 13 ms 65.19.111.204 8 10 ms 9 ms 10 ms opti39-6.nassau.cv.net [167.206.39.6] 9 18 ms 16 ms 15 ms ubr101-ge1-0-0.cmts.soldny.cv.net [167.206.39.41] 10 17 ms 18 ms 19 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] 11 21 ms 15 ms 17 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] Trace complete. </s>

<s> They can refuse. </s>
<s> I can assure you that your PC is not causing it. </s>

<s> You wrote: &quot;If this is bothersome, then find the router owner and have them fix it.&quot; I posted a simple technical question and expected a simple technical response. </s>
<s> Instead I get a facetious reply. </s>
<s> You surely do not expect the ISP to change their configuration for me? </s>
<s> I would suggest that if you do not have a practical answer to a problem, do not respond at all. </s>
<s> This is my first experience with CNET Forums. </s>
<s> Needless to say I am very disappointed. </s>
<s> You learn from the router's owner why they didn't respond to the route inquiry. </s>
<s> I hope you understand this well enough so you don't jump off, format your PC in hopes of fixing it. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
