Like other issues, it is best done when everything works. I recently installed a Western Digital 1 terrabyte drive and the cloning software that came with it was not compatible with Windows Home Server or Windows Vista or Apple's OS. Carbon Copy for Apple OS. Again, your drive needs to be working. If you have errors in your hard drive, they will not be corrected by cloning.

You can download it from their site. You install it to a floppy or CD then boot the computer from the floppy/CD that has the original and the new (has to be larger) drive attached. Menu system walks you through it all.

All you need is the old (bad) HDD, and the new one, both hooked up to a computer running WinHex and you're set.
