It's a shame that the PC has no make or model but I will part with this. Gamers are a finicky lot and won't be happy with this. I'm talking GAMERS. The ones that jump from PC to PC or change cards to get a few more FPS. You often hear them use the word lag in less than 5 minutes. It's a great system noted there and games should be fine for that GPU. Bob
