<s> I have a 2003 Small Business Server. </s>
<s> Just last week I had 37G total, 19G free. </s>
<s> A few days ago, I had 403 M free. </s>
<s> When I check the disk usage total it shows the builtin/administrators account using 35G, but I can't figure out what processes could be using it. </s>
<s> The shadow copy service had been running, and that was using 3G, once I disabled it I got it back, but the next day my storage was used up again. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Wow is my first reaction. </s>
<s> My second is WOW again! </s>
<s> I don't think I have ever ran across that but having said that, my guess is a virus can be the cause. </s>
<s> You did not mention what type of files are taking up your disk space? </s>
<s> Also, are you able to remove them? </s>
<s> I would check the &quot;Services&quot; file under Administrative Tools very closely and determine any suspicious entries. </s>
<s> It took half a day to help fix a friends laptop that was saturated with trojans, spyware, uname it and I found several entries in the Services file. </s>
<s> These hackers set the recovery of their programs to 4977 times to restart!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Exactly what folder is the data being held in? </s>
<s> It does sound like an infection, since that account is the only account that a quota can't be used to keep in check. </s>
<s> *************************************************** BTW Shadow Copy = Good. </s>
<s> Don't turn it off. </s>
<s> Leverage its capabilities. </s>
<s> Just my opinion. </s>
