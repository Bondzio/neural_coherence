I appreciated your help, but maybe I haven't explained what I'm interested in.
I simply want to purchase a router which will pass external IP addresses to an apache server log, or allow something like phpbb to associated external IP addresses to posts.
I just need to know what to look for when I'm shopping for a new router.
thanks.kah
