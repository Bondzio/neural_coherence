What do you plan to use the Tablet for?
Chances are, you will get far more mileage with the iPad 3 then Windows Tablet.
W-Tab is yet to be released, the app selection will be tiny compared to iOS or Android.
Android also suffers from consistent support.
Most Android tables do not have easy OS upgrades, and incomplete hardware support.
There are very good reasons why iPad dominates tablets, will over 60% of tablet sales.
An iPad 1 can be updated to the latest iOS 5.1.1 (and like iOS 6).
Of course iPad has limits, so consider that when you look at when you decide.
Bottom line: wait a few months on how successful the Windows tab is before you decide to spend your money.
