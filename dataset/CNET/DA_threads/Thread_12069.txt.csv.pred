1.1.1	My computer has an eSATA port , not the eSATAp port though , so most modern external hard drives will not work with it .	St
1.1.2	I had to find myself an external hard drive case that had eSATA and an independent power source .	St
1.1.3	I found it in this case .	St
1.1.4	http : //www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817379024 The reviews are good , it 's nice and shiny , and it can support up to 3 terabytes .	St
1.1.5	I got myself a Caviar Black , 2 terabyte Western Digital internal SATA drive to put in it , and the drive just arrived today .	St
1.1.6	This is the first time I 've done this so I was extremely careful throughout the entire process .	St
1.1.7	I grounded myself , I did n't touch any of the green circuit board surfaces , I did n't force the screws , and I followed every step to the letter .	St
1.1.8	I 've now reached the step where I have to plug the complete drive into the eSATA port on my computer and ... nothing is happening .	St
1.1.9	It 's plugged into the wall , the switch is on the ON position , I can even hear the drive spinning , but ... the drive will not appear in My Computer .	St
1.1.10	The drive case also came with a USB 3.0 cable , so even though my computer does n't have any USB 3.0 I tried to plug it in , just to see if it works .	St
1.1.11	THAT one does give me a reaction , the computer tells me it has detected a new device .	St
1.1.12	It installed the drivers for about 2 seconds , and then it did ... nothing else .	St
1.1.13	I still ca n't see anything in My Computer .	St
1.1.14	I tried to reboot , carefully unplug and replug the connections .	St
1.1.15	The only thing I have n't tried yet is re-opening the whole thing and checking to make sure all the connections are good ( which I 'm sure they are , I triple checked them before screwing it shut .	St
1.1.16	Please please PLEASE , help me .	Sug
1.1.17	With taxes and shipping and handling this kit has cost me 270 $ , I do not want it to all go to waste .	St
1.1.18	I ca n't understand what 's wrong , and both the manual I received and the one from Zalman 's website offer no help at all .	St
1.2.1	If the drive is n't partioned it does n't show in My Computer .	St
1.2.2	If it 's partitioned , but the file system is corrupted somehow , it does n't show up either .	St
1.2.3	So the question is : does Disc Management see it ?	Ques
1.2.4	And what does it tell about it .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	I 'd like to go on record first stating that the manual stated nothing about Disc Management , so if this is how one usually goes about installing a new drive , that manual is seriously lacking ... Also thank you for the quick response time .	St
1.3.2	I ran the disk management program from the start search bar ( I 'm on Windows 7 Home 64-bit ) , and a window popped open that is called & quot ; Initialize Disc & quot ; & quot ; You must initialize a disk before Logical Disk Manager can access it .	St
1.3.3	Select disk : ( and here it shows only & quot ; Disk 3 & quot ; ) Use the following partition style for the selected disks. & quot ; There are two options , & quot ; MBR ( Master Boot Record ) & quot ; and & quot ; GPT ( GUID Partition Table ) & quot ; .	St
1.3.4	Then it adds , & quot ; Note : The GPT partition style is not recognized by all previous versions of Windows .	St
1.3.5	It is recommended for disks larger than 2TB , or disks used on ltanium-based computers. & quot ; wow , so much technobabble ...	St
1.4.1	I got super impatient and decided to go for the MBR option .	St
1.4.2	Disc 3 popped up in the list of drives in the manager , along with Disc 0 ( my main C : drive inside the computer ) , and Disc 1 and Disc 2 which both seem to be ... not present .	St
1.4.3	Those 2 might be my external portable drives I have somewhere .	St
1.4.4	So yeah , the drive said something like & quot ; Unallocated & quot ; , so I right clicked and asked him to ... initiallize , I think ( I should have taken better notes ) .	St
1.4.5	He then asked me if I wanted my drive to be NTFS or exFAT , and I have to say I have no Godly idea what those mean , I did a quick search and got the vague idea that NTFS is more common , and picked that one .	St
1.4.6	So after a brief bit of panic and a wizard installation , it WORKS .	St
1.4.7	So ... yeah , if anyone still wants to explain how it works , perticularly what the difference between NTFS and exFAT is , for future purposes , please feel free to post .	St
1.5.1	Ummmm ... something 's gone wrong .	St
1.5.2	Not sure what it is yet .	Res
1.5.3	I started transfering movies to the new drive , while simultaneously browsing on Chrome , and chatting on MSN .	St
1.5.4	Since I 've upgraded the RAM to 7 GB this kind of simple multitasking has never been a problem .	St
1.5.5	But ... while I was transfering it started these huge bouts of lag , each one lasting over 5 seconds , spaced about a minute apart .	St
1.5.6	I tried to shut off MSN and Chrome , but my entire computer locked up , I had to force shut down using the power button and unplugged the new drive .	St
1.5.7	Now I 'm scared to plug it back in again .	St
1.5.8	Any idea what the hell just happened ?	Ques
1.6.1	To avoid all the overhead of copying with Explorer I have for years used the command line since it avoids explorer looking at each file and building thumbnails and more .	St
1.6.2	Not much new going on .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	So what do you think I should do to help avoid these bugs ?	Ques
1.7.2	Did I do something wrong when I initialized it ?	Ques
1.7.3	Or do you think they are inherent bugs with the setup ?	Ques
1.7.4	Because none of the reviews mentioned anything like this ... Of course it could also be a failing on my cheap-skate computer itself .	St
1.7.5	Bad news if this is the case , I will need to get a new comp sooner than later .	St
1.7.6	Good news , the drive itself should be fine , and when I do get a new comp it should run perfectly .	St
1.8.1	Remember that since I can use the command line I do n't need an app like : http : //download.cnet.com/TeraCopy/3000-2248_4-10671835.html	St
1.9.1	So if I do n't know how to use the command line , that app would be of use to me ?	Ques
1.9.2	Make the drive less buggy ?	Ques
1.10.1	I 've read in my browsing the issue that I might be able to upgrade the BIOS of my motherboard to better support 2TB hard drives .	St
1.10.2	Can anyone confirm or deny this ?	Ques
1.10.3	And if it is true , is upgrading the BIOS difficult ?	Ques
1.11.1	I found something on my computer 's spec sheet : http : //support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/2010/acer/Aspire/AspireX3400/AspireX3400sp2.shtml Under & quot ; Storage & quot ; it shows ( from what I can gather ) that it can indeed support 2 TB drives , but only ones that run at 5400 rpm ( for some reason ) .	St
1.11.2	It can support 160/250/320/500/640/750/1000 Gb drives at 7200 rpm , but over 1 TB ... it needs it to slow down .	St
1.11.3	And would n't you know it , I got myself a 7200 RPM 2 TB ...	St
1.11.4	I honestly do n't know if that 's something you can change with BIOS updates , it sounds frustratingly final .	St
1.12.1	If you do n't know how to use the command line processor in your OS ( Bob and I have grown up using MS-DOS and know about commands like cd , copy and xcopy and what paths and wildcards are ) , then use Explorer and accept that the machine is more or less unusable while copying files to it .	St
1.12.2	NTFS is a good choice , by the way .	St
1.12.3	Kees	St
1.13.1	It 's not something one would teach or learn in a forum setting for many reasons .	St
1.13.2	One is that there is the web .	St
1.13.3	& quot ; That app & quot ; is one that tackles the issues that Explorer exposes .	St
1.13.4	Using the command line is preferred by me since it solves it without having to install another app .	St
1.13.5	Besides how would I do this on other machines ?	Ques
1.13.6	As to the drive being buggy .	St
1.13.7	If false then it 's the usual Windows is too busy to respond to you .	St
1.13.8	If true then you have a warranty issue and ask the makers of machine , OS and drives to fix it .	St
1.13.9	My bet is the usual & quot ; Windows Explorer is too busy issue. & quot ; A parting thought is to check the hard drive maker 's web page on the drive and see if they issued new firmware .	St
1.13.10	It 's pretty rare but does happen that a drive needs updated firmware .	St
1.13.11	YES , it happened to me .	St
1.13.12	Bob	St
1.14.1	As I mentioned above , I think it has to do with the RPMs .	St
1.14.2	My computer can handle 7200 RPM drives just fine , so long as they are 1 TB or less .	St
1.14.3	Above 1 TB it can only handle 5400 RPM .	St
1.14.4	I did n't realize this when I bought the 2 TB 7200 RPM drive .	St
1.14.5	I remember when I was & quot ; allocating & quot ; the drive that it asked me what RPMs I wanted , and I kept them at the default 7200 RPM because I thought it would just help response time .	St
1.14.6	But now I ca n't seem to find that allocation button in Disc Management ...	St
1.15.1	I ca n't guess where such misinformation comes from .	St
1.16.1	I think it 's from Acer 's site .	St
1.16.2	Though maybe I 'm just missunderstanding it .	St
1.16.3	http : //support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/2010/acer/Aspire/AspireX3400/AspireX3400sp2.shtml	St
1.17.1	Indeed .	St
1.17.2	That specification is about what they offer as an internal hard disk when you buy the machine .	St
1.17.3	Either & lt ; = 1GB and faster ( 7200 RPM ) or & gt ; = 1 GB and slower ( 5400 RPM ) , depending on the model .	St
1.17.4	That has nothing to do with your external eSATA disk .	St
1.17.5	Kees	St
