this is why older devices get abandoned due to old age and connectivity to include s/w issues.
i don't see why the lpt/pci parallel port card didn't work, it should have.
however, answer lpt1 for the parallel port question or check in &quot;device manager&quot; what lptx get listed.
you also lack details of your system, maybe there is a lpt port available and/or some bios setting to be done.
otherwise, you've gone as far as the legacy device allows with its dated drivers and s/w.
the real fix is to replace that device with supported usb connect.
