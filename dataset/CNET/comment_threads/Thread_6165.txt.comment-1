I currently have added a Maxtor PCI SATA card to my system, but the motherboard (P4 1.7 with 66mh mobo, I think) doesn't let me enjoy the truly high-end speeds because of the PCI bottleneck.
Sadly, the attached HD has taken to coughing fits of random mechanical noises and must soon be replaced.
To the same system, I've added an Adaptec USB 2.0 expansion card.
Q: Any comments/ideas as to the differences in speed to be expected on an internal SATA replacement drive -vs- external USB 2.0 drive in this case?
thanks in advance for any help.
