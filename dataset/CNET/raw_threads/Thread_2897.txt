9442	0	236839	2420901	NR	jconner	3/4/07 5:32 PM	1.17302952E12	Old MOBO New MOBO? - advice needed	I currently am doing audio recording using a Compaq Ap550 workstation, which has dual P3 processors (1Ghz each), 1Gb rdram, an Nvidia Quadro-4 980 8x AGP (the Mobo only runs 4X), all legacy disabled and my audio is via USB 2.0 (M-audio Fasttrack Pro). I also have a Creative Labs X-Fi Fidelity sound card. 18Gb SCSI U160 system disk and ATA-100 250Gb storage. Lite-on CDRW/DVD RW combo. I'm running XP sp2. I want to upgrade the system and am currently reviewing motherboards. I'd like to keep as much existing hardware as possible, though I will replace the SCSI with a SATA drive. The Quadro was a worker in its day but I suspect replacing it with as good a PCI-Ex for the reasonable $ I paid is going to be tough. I'm considering an ASUS P5VD1-X, 2GB DDR2 and a Pentium D 2.66Ghz. as it supports both AGP-8X and PCI-Ex I could use my Quadro until I'm ready to pop for a new GC. Any thoughts on these boards? They are hard to find new and seem to have been replaced with the P5VD2-X PCI-Ex only. Same board but no AGP it seems. Are there any others I might consider?

I already have Vista Business ready to go, except that M-Audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve, so it will have to be XP for a while longer. 64 bit even later. I have a new case / PS and wireless KB/Mouse etc. Core Duo makes sense as I'm already sold on multi-processors anyway.
