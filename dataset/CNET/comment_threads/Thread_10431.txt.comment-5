Thanks for the comments guys, I really valued your opinions.
The next CPU up from mine would undoubtedly be a Quad Core but there's still a premium to pay with the price despite them being old hat now.
There's one CPU Quad at 300.
Phew!
As Bob said it's not worth the extra few Mhz I might get.
Thx again, it's nice knowing guys like you will offer honest opinions, and I was just fishing around for a second opinion.
Cheers
