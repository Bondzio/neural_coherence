Been getting this error message for a while now - at first I put it down to dirty or scratched cd's, however I now notice that it is also giving the same response to my e drive (both asus drives, one dvd rom, one cd rw) and also to my floppy a drive.
To my knowlede the only recent update to my computer is the upgrading to the latest Norton Systemworks.
Very annoying so any help will be greatly appreciated.
Col.
