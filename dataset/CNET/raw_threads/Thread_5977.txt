The universal, mvp or normal one? I have tried all of them. They kind of work, but when i load up a game with it, it just crashes. Ive tried Diablo 3. When it loads, it crashes. When i turn virtu off, it works perfectly. Its up to date Gpu: Sapphire 6790 special edition Thanks

But I can't answer your question about &quot;lucid virtu&quot; because I've never needed such software. And if the author or company will not talk to you then that is a sure sign you don't want to use this. Bob
