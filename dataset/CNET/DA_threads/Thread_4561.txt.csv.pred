1.1.1	I am replacing my motherboard with a Gigabyte GA-7VA, which has a VIA KT400 chipset.	St
1.1.2	When I picked it up the seller asked my OS and when I told him, &quot;Windows XP Professional&quot; he recommended that before installing the board I change a setting in Device Manager, commenting that if he himself had done so before installing the board it would have saved him a lot of trouble.	St
1.1.3	I can no longer contact him but what I can recall is this: The setting that should be changed is PCI to IDE device.	St
1.1.4	He said I should uninstall the driver and then update it, selecting &quot;standard driver&quot; from a list.	St
1.1.5	I asked what part of Device Manager to look at and he said it would be in System Devices.	St
1.1.6	Now that I am ready to install the board I have opened Device Manager and System Devices but cannot see &quot;PCI to IDE.&quot; I would appreciate any advice about this because I have no idea what he was talking about.	St
1.2.1	Try contact the Gigabyte support; http://www.giga-byte.com/TechSupport/ServiceCenter.htm	St
