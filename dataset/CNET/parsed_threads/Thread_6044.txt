<s> I have a question regarding Built in LAN connections. </s>
<s> I have two desktops that are being readied for use in my shop. </s>
<s> Both have Win 7 64 bit, one Professional and one Home premium. </s>
<s> When I wanted to download a file to install on each of them, a 350Mb file, one desktop took over an hour and a half to do so, where the other desktop came in at about 8 minutes. </s>
<s> Same LAN, Realtek RTL8111D on both boards, although different manufacturers. </s>
<s> One Gigabyte board, one MSI board. </s>
<s> Any ideas what might have caused this? </s>
<s> Perhaps a bad driver? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if pc A took 1:30:00 but pc B started after A was finished, the download appears to have been cached. </s>
<s> try the download speed tests at http://www.speedtest.net and/or http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest . </s>
<s> both of you PC's should give similar results -- if not, something's wrong with the slowpoke. </s>
<s> The computers were built at different times, and the downloads were done at different times. </s>
<s> I use a KVM to hook up the new builds for my customers, and was updating Adobe software. </s>
<s> At first I thought it was just the server, but the second PC D/L the software through the same router/modem setup as the first PC, only at light speed. </s>
<s> if the second pc started the d/l after the first pc completed, it sounds like your isp is caching the dl. </s>
<s> this is a good thing! </s>
<s> test both pcs at dslreports or speedtest to make sure there's nothing wrong with the &quot;slowpoke&quot; </s>
