<s> I am trying to build a semi-budget computer, however I am not too sure on skimping on the computer RAM since I ran into computer problems with some inexpensive Spektek ram before. </s>
<s> What I am looking at is Kingston ValueRam, mainly cause of the good Kingston name. </s>
<s> However, the ValueRam name kinda keeps me wondering, was something vitally important cut out of the chips? </s>
<s> Were they defects that are still workable, but with flaws? </s>
<s> Why are they ValueRam vs. the Regular RAM they sell for a higher price? </s>
<s> Dont Want another computer problem that can occur after warranty/return date. </s>
<s> comp usa cheapest most quality ram you can find and yes they have the kingston Trio ram you want </s>
<s> Here are some other places with good prices. </s>
