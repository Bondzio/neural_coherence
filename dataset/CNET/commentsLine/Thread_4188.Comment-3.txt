the suggestions of the company make me think they've not thought seriously about computers - at least not for a long time.
win 2000 is gonna be hard to work with nowadays.
pentium ii (or iii or 4) are too slow for modern work.
what does the job entail?
i really think &quot;computer illiterate&quot; goes best with talking to live people at a store you like.
try a best buy - their employees aren't on commission.
buying mail order is ok to save $$ but only if you know what you're doing, can handle the configuration & set-up yourself, and don't want good service.
for someone who really needs their machine for work, and doesn't know a lot about them could really benefit from a place that can do set-ups and service plans.
when your paycheck depends on it, it's different than if it's just for messing around on myspace or cnet.
