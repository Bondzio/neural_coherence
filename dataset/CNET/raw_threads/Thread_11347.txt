Private ip address for NAS LaCie d2 Network is 192.168.10.50 and it is mapped to 87.67.x.x (not real WAN ip) with port 21 as can be seen below : http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=8x0745&s=3 From any remote location when I type in in a browser this ftp://87.67.x.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I can access the folder on the NAS LaCie d2 Networ as can be seen on the snapshot below : http://i25.tinypic.com/zuidsw.png Rather than driving to the clients site and access through his LAN, I need to access the NAS remotely to update few configuration. How can I remotely access web interface for LaCie d2 Network? I tried to read the documentation below but I could not locate the section that is related to what I am looking for http://www.lacie.com/download/manual/d2Network_en.pdf Thanks

Thanks

You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product. As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more? Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP. I don't need to write why but this and other common server ports are too often blocked. This area is slamming a few out there. Bob

Hi Bob &gt;&gt;I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.&lt;&lt; No this is not the case for me. &gt;&gt;You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product&lt;&lt;. What do mean I can try ? could you please explain ? &gt;&gt;As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?&lt;&lt; Yes I konw that port 20 is a data port on a server side. When the client uses active mode, the server only needs to receive connections on port 21, so forwarding only port 21 is sufficient for that. &gt;&gt;Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP&lt;&lt; This is also not my case.
