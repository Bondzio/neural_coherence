that what I hear from the cable company -- only digital content coming over the cable next year.
do you hear anything differently?
What I understand is that the program is to redeem the OTA bandwidth and force most OTA TV stations off the air; At any rate, the number of stations one could receive is a very few whilst the number of cable channels is over 100 with all the specialty channels, etc.
OTA is dead which is why the feds are paying the stations so much to go dark.
