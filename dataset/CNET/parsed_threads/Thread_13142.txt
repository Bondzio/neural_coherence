<s> I bought a new heatsink and when I went to put it in I found out that it didn't fit into the bracket thing. </s>
<s> Stupid me thought that a socket 478 heatsink would fit onto my socket 478 mobo. </s>
<s> The new heatsink has the four clips thing. </s>
<s> Basically here is my mother board ( http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/lc/d865GLC_lg.jpg ), but the black thing surrounding the socket is different, it has two spring things that look more like the one on the bottom of this: ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/ShowImage.asp?image=35-114-021-01.jpg,35-114-021-02.jpg,35-114-021-03.jpg,35-114-021-04.jpg&CurImage=35-114-021-01.jpg&Description=Dynatron%20D29%20CPU%20Cooling%20Fan/Heatsink%20-%20Retail ) Am I boned here? </s>
<s> Can that bracket thing be swapped out? </s>
<s> It has those strange screw heads, implying to me that it isn't supposed to be removed. </s>
<s> What is that thing even called? </s>
<s> If anyone can answer any of these questions, it would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> And sorry for messing up the formatting with the long link, but I don't know how to describe that thing and a picture is worth a thousand words, yada, yada. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> newegg [great outfit]. </s>
<s> They state exact replacement only, HOWEVER, call the 800 number, talk to their customer support, they'll work with you. </s>
<s> They won't do a direct exchange however will give full credit when they get the part back and inspect that they got all of the pieces back. </s>
<s> Meanwhile place a new order for what you want. </s>
<s> You'll have to pay then but you will get the refund when they get the part back. </s>
<s> I've done this with newegg a number of times. </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion, that is not the actual cooler I bought, I was just using the picture to show the bracket. </s>
<s> I actually bought it from tigerdirect.ca, anyone know how they are about returning things. </s>
<s> The cooler I did buy is this one http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=235454&Sku=ULT31424 . </s>
<s> I'd rather not have to deal with returning it, but I wouldn't risk my mobo either, sooooo.....yeah. </s>
<s> Also, if anybody knows where I could get a decent cooler (quiet too) that would fit this bracket thing, that would be great. </s>
<s> One stipulation is that it could be delivered to Canada, so unfortunately no newegg or zipzoomfly. </s>
<s> metal clips won't connect to the plastic bracket attached to the mobo??? </s>
<s> Most of the ones that I've seen are much nicer plastic levers and very simple to use. </s>
<s> It looks like it could get locked in on two corners, but I can't even fit the heatsink into the bracket. </s>
<s> I could force it, but then I risk doing some serious damage and I still wouldn't be sure that there is good contact between the heatsink and the chip, so no dice. </s>
<s> The heat sink that's in there now measures 63mm X 89 mm. </s>
<s> The new one I bought is 68mm X 83 mm. </s>
<s> That extra 5mm is really killing me. </s>
<s> Remove the stock bracket from 2-4 screws holding from backside of mtrbd. </s>
<s> Then replace using the new bracket with fan off. </s>
<s> Later mount the fan. </s>
<s> That is what it appears needs to be done. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Would I be able to buy that at any computer store? </s>
<s> It there a risk I could damage the mobo? </s>
<s> This would involve removing the mobo, is that right? </s>
<s> It seems to be called a &quot;Retention Module&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the replies so far. </s>
<s> Yes and No, as you remove the system case, some vendors provide a hole(thru mounting plate) to access the rear of the mtrbd.. </s>
<s> If not, yes you have to remove the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and access the rear of it. </s>
<s> The screws are plain screws, thumbscrews or clamp clips, proceed as necessary. </s>
<s> Yeah, you proceed at your own risk. </s>
<s> Otherwise, forget about that HSF and get one more stock compatible. </s>
<s> OK? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Sounds good, thanks for the help. </s>
