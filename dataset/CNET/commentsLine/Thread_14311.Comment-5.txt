hi lynn a simple way to describe it would be like... you buy a harddisk of 500gb for your computer.
1) create one big partition will give you c: drive with 500gb 2) create e.g.
two partitions will give you c: drive with e.g.
60 gb and a d: drive with the remaining 440gb.
(actual drive space will be less but its easier to understand this way).
the advantage of creating partitions like in example 2), is if you only use c: for your os and to install applications and drive d: to store all your data, you can format the c: drive and reinstall your os, without moving your data on the d: drive.
in this way your computer will get more organized (not faster nor safer).
but remember.
if the harddisk crash both drive c: and d: will be lost.
