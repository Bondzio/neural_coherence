1.1.1	Hello - I'm shopping around for a new video card, and I noticed that there are a number of cards that appear to be ATI cards, but have a different brand name.	St
1.1.2	For example, I found a &quot;Sapphire ATI Radeon X800 PRO Video Card&quot; in one online store.	St
1.1.3	My question is, is there any difference between cards like this and the ones labeled specifically ATI, other than the price?	St
1.1.4	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	They use the model ATI chip advertised, but they may set it up entirely differently, including the rate that they clock the memory or set other parameters.	St
1.2.2	Some sites provide the clocking info.	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info, I'll remember to look into that.	St
