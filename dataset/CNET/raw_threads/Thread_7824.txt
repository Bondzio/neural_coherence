Will it be able to fit in/work on my computer? 2. Will it be able to smoothly run games like CS:Source and Guild Wars. I have already upgraded the RAM so that isn't a problem. The graphics card is: NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS 256MB DDR2 HDTV/DVI (PCI-Express) A link to it: http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_8400_features.html

They have a lot of documentation on their site, but I couldn't easily find if it has the PCI-Express that's needed for the card you asked about. Can you find something about available slots in the documentation that came with the PC? Kees
