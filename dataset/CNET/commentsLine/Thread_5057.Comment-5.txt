i put an 80 gig wd hd in a cheap plastic enclosure case, and it's been running fine for months- i've even forgotten to turn it off, and luckily didn't toast it.
but, as bob said, it's temporary storage.
it's convenient to carry about, works really fast on my usb 2 connection, and my network sees it.
all fine and good.
but- i've still archived everything important to cd/dvd disks.
disaster strikes just when you least expect it....which reminds me, i haven't backed up some important stuff in awhile....thanks for reminder, bob!
