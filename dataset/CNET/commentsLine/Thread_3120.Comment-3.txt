manually configuring the network.
1) what os is being used?
2) workgroup name should be the same on both machines.
3) file and print sharing enabled and a folder or more set to share.
4) firewalls down until you have a working network.
5) xp/2k may require you to set up a user account for the each machine to log in to.
an unplugged network cable message is just that, the nic does not see a cable attached to it.
which in your case seems right for the laptop not having a cable plugged in.
