i have win32/adware.virtumonde and win32/privacyremoer.m64 on my computer.
theses viruses will not allow me to connect to the internet and i got a anti-virus program from a friend but when i put it in my computer does not recognize it.
how do i get rid of this...i found instructions on the web to manually remove this but it says it might destroy the comp.
i can not take the chance nor afford to attempt something like that.
so any help would be appreciated.
thanks!
