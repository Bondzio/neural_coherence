HOWEVER, I wouldn't put any money into such an old system (Pentium III). Just enjoy it as is for what it does well--word processing, email, Web browsing, and other less resource intensive tasks. Maybe even try a couple Linux distributions (some will run faster than XP on that computer). If you really feel the need to open your wallet, I'd put my money towards one of today's inexpensive desktops or notebooks. In terms of software, you can streamline XP by getting rid of a unnecessary programs and services that run in the background. Clean it of all viruses, spyware, malware, and P2P clients. Burn those videos and pics to CD/DVD and remove them from your hard drive if it is getting full. Google: make XP run faster
