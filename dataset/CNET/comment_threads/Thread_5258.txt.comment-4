I beleive I have tracked it down to one of two services that iTunes installs.
These are IPAHelper and AppleMobileDeviceService.
It is one of these two causing it.
I have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again.
I just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is (since I do not need either to run, I just suspend both).
I do have a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the MS site (ver 6.2), so it is not the MS drivers.
