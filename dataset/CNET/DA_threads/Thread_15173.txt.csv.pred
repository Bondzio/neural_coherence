1.1.1	It 's getting round to my PC laptop upgrade time again , and am wondering whether the Galaxy Note 10.1 ( Android ) could serve as a laptop replacement if I get it with the keyboard dock and usb mouse for when I need to turn it into .	St
1.1.2	After all , my laptop needs are ( i ) that it is light and compact ( ii ) that it is compatible with high speed mobile internet use including Skype and Youtube ( iii ) stores PDFs , photos , and supports standard PC programmes such as Word and Excel .	St
1.1.3	Gaming functionality is just a 'nice to have ' .	St
1.1.4	Is there any reason NOT to get the Galaxy Note 10.1 as my laptop replacement ?	Ques
1.1.5	One reason I suppose is that Samsung are apparently coming out with yet another Tablet , but a Windows based one .	St
1.1.6	Is it worth me waiting for that if I am looking for a laptop replacement in my tab ?	Ques
1.2.1	Standard PC programs like MS Word and MS Excel do n't run on Android .	St
1.2.2	So if that 's a requirement , Android is a no-go .	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your info about Android - so I 'll avoid that .	St
1.3.2	I have a budget of 500 UK pounds / 600 euros / 800 US dollars What 's the best Windows-based tablet I can buy as a laptop replacement ?	Ques
1.4.1	That you can find them in just a short while .	St
1.4.2	And then you see 2 basic offerings .	St
1.4.3	One is the usual NETBOOK CPU and it 's lack of speed may put you off .	St
1.4.4	Not only that you paid full price for a laptop but got a netbook .	St
1.4.5	The other is usually i5 based and you could buy 2 laptops for that one tablet .	St
1.4.6	Why the fascination of the tablet ?	Ques
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Good question .	St
1.5.2	Just that it is the latest thing and I 'd like to try it .	St
1.5.3	I like the adaptability of having the lightness of a tablet when i browse the internet in a coffee shop , or watch a movie on the train , then the ability to connect it to a keyboard at my desk when i need to write a big word file .	St
1.5.4	I may either settle on another small laptop , or hold out for the Windows 8 tablets coming out within 2 months , eg the Samsung Ativ Smart PC ( which is a large monster , am assuming there will be smaller Win8 Tablet offers )	St

1.7.1	I have a tablet .	St
1.7.2	It 's one of the android things and does not replace my laptop .	St
1.7.3	I do n't attach a keyboard but set down the tablet when I go to use my laptop .	St
1.7.4	Those that try to merge the 2 will be very upset .	St
1.7.5	As to the Win8 tablet if it 's one of the ARM based units , again , no Word for you unless Microsoft issues it .	St
1.7.6	It appears you may be learning about these new devices .	St
1.7.7	That is , I 've encountered folk that thought they would be a small & quot ; Windows PC & quot ; and they are not .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	& quot ; It appears you may be learning about these new devices .	St
1.8.2	That is , I 've encountered folk that thought they would be a small & quot ; Windows PC & quot ; and they are not. & quot ; exactly why i 'm here .	St
1.8.3	thanks for sharing .	Polite
1.8.4	still , Win8 looks to be about to bring us small & quot ; Windows PC & quot ; tablets after all	St
1.9.1	The Surface , I linked to above , will be in 2 versions : ARM and non-ARM .	St
1.9.2	The non-ARM versions will be rather expensive .	St
1.9.3	But indeed , they will run MS Office .	St
1.9.4	And surely , there will be other models from other makers .	St
1.9.5	Just a few weeks waiting and you can read the reviews or even try them yourself .	Sug
1.9.6	Kees	St
1.10.1	The Surface looks perfect .	Polite
1.10.2	But yes , bet it 'll be expensive - probably double my budget .	St
1.10.3	In the meantime , any recommendations for the best value PC laptop at a budget of 500 UK pounds / 600 euros / 800 US dollars ?	Ques
1.10.4	I 'd go for 10.1 & quot ; for weight of 1.3 KG or less , and am a sucker for big brands such as Samsung and HP ( ca n't imagine buying a Lenovo , Assus or Acer ) .	St
1.11.1	Is the top post with some new entry with the best sellers at amazon .	Ques
1.11.2	I have had a lot of positive feedback on that .	St
