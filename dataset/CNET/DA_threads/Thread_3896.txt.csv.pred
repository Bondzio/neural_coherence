1.1.1	I was given an HP 9600 Pavilion desktop comp as a hand-me down.	St
1.1.2	It currently runs Win98, but I would like to upgrade to WinXP if possible, since that is what I use on my main comp in another room.	St
1.1.3	Can this be done without any major issues?	St
1.1.4	I have never had to upgrade a comp before, so please address this issue in as simplistic terms as possible.	St
1.1.5	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Start at HP.com and look up your model.	St
1.2.2	Some do not run XP.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
