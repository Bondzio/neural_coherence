when i opened this computer when it arrived and was planning to put the other drive in, it was obvious the cable was different.
it looked like a double ac cord and it is medium blue.
it doesn't look like any wiring i've ever seen in a computer, but it was obvious that it was not like the cables in my old computer.
pc relocator is wonderful.
it is a cd that is installed on both computers and comes with a connector that is plugged into both computers.
this computer already had windows installed so i just went thru the list of applications and files i wanted copied on to the new computer from the old and it worked like a dream.
i figured the process would take hours, so i left my office here at home, had lunch with friends and came back expecting to have to sit here for hours, but when i got back it was finished.
i was hoping for a solution to the clean install that would allow me to do the same thing, i.e., install windows on a 2nd drive, copy the apps i wanted to keep to it, format the hard drive and do a reverse copy.
i guess i was hoping for too much.
talk to you soon, ann
