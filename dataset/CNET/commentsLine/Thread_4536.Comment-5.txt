you're looking at a $105 geforce 7600gt and a $285 8800gts.
why?
if the 8800gts fits in your budget, get it because there's no other $300 card that can match its peformance.
if you only have $200, get a radeon x1900xt.
if only $160, its a tough call between a geforce 8600gts (dx10), geforce 7900gs (faster), or radeon x1950pro (fastest).
don't put anything slower (like a 7600gt) in a new gaming rig.
