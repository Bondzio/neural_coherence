12045	0	406221	3357904	NR	MiserableJoe	8/14/10 2:49 PM	1.28179734E12	Buying a new computer	I am going from an 5 year old AMD Athlon 64 3000+ to either an I5 or I7. I am not a gamer or video editor. Because I am going from an IDE hard drive to SATA Best Buy says I must use a device called Black Widow to transfer my files. Is this true? I tried the online backup system but all it did was bang my hard drive every few minutes. Any comments on I5 or I7 would be greatly appreciated. I am not really Miserable, but I couldn't use any of my usual names to sign up and there used to be a guy who came to a bar I went to and we called him Miserable Joe.
