The laptop is mine but the computer is my school PC on which I have Power user account. They both have those LAN connection things. I have the LAN cable for the laptop. What I did was to plug the cable into both LAN connections. This does not seem to work. I want to transfer some files. Thanks.

However when i try to connect to the PC it asks me for a username and password. Is there a way to get around this. Another way I was thinking is to unplug a PC and plug my laaptop into the network and send the files to the PC that I want to. The only thing is that I can't seem to be able to join the school network either.

Somehow I thought of creating and administrator account on the school PC via my power user account. Didn't think it would work but it did and then I logged on as an admin and now i can transfer my files. Still not sure how that was possible though, but it worked. hehe
