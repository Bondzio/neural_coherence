I am using a cable modem to connect to the internet, and I need wired internet access for 2 PC's (one Vista and one XP). I don't have LAN configured, and I don't want the two PC's to be connected to each other. The tech from my ISP told me that I just need a hub or switch, but the rep at the computer store told me that I need a LAN in order to use the switch, so if I don't want a LAN I should use a wired router instead. So, do I need a router or a switch? Also, if I connect more than one PC's to the router or switch, is the connection speed going to drop? Thanks a lot!

You can just disable the wireless side and not use it until needed. Most router also give you extra security with NAT and SPI firewalls. Your speed will not go down on the wired ports of the router, but the wireless side will if you decide to use that.
