1.1.1	I 've been using a Linksys wireless g broadband router , which works good depending on my location in the house , as good as one would expect .	St
1.1.2	I also have connected devices ( PVR 's ) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router .	St
1.1.3	I recently came upon a spare wireless b access point , linksys as well , that I was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a PVR .	St
1.1.4	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.5	I did try connecting it , and the signal is excellent in that area , but I do not have internet access with that connection .	St
1.1.6	( it 's listed as a seperate possible connection point ) Might it be because the 1st wireless device has WEP ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.8	Thanks in advance .	St

1.2.1	and configure it with the same IP range.. and use it as repeater/range expander.. place it in between your main AP and your PC location .	St
1.2.2	But , as you said it is a B type.. so you will get the B speed ( 11mbps ) .	St
