in your first post you stated that you kept losing the internet connection at the router.
anyway if you want to change the ethernet to full duplex(it may already be set that way).
your ethernet controller may be different than mine but many are intel.
i get to the ethernet control panel by going to: start programs intel network adapter inel pro set this will open up the ethernet configuration.
click the advanced tab in the setting box look for link speed and duplex set the value to full duplex click apply click ok
