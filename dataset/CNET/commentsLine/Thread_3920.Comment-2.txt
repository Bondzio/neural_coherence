i suspect that when you are pushing the graphics card in the games, your power supply cannot provide enough stable 12v power, thereby causing the &quot;graphic card crash&quot;.
the 350 supply is just above the bare minimum of 300 that the 6600gt requires and i suspect if we actually measured it, it falls short.
