I have searched and downloaded all the drivers i can for an nvidia geforce ti4200 128 meg vid card, and a gigabyte GA-7dxr+ motherboard wtih amd 1800xp+ proccessor, it seems to lock up from heavy proccessor usage maybe, because i dont think its graphical due to still being able to run good framerates and go thru system intensive graphical areas, as in alotta polygons on screen at once, without freezing, when it does freeze theres no slowing down etc, just bam, lock up and have to reboot, occasionally it reboots instead of locks up, im just wondering if its a faulty piece of hardware or what im on a fresh reformat of XP pro, on a brand new HD pushing 300w ATX power to 2 cd drives and the hard drive is all, only locked up once or twice while on desktop, but it happens just looking for any tips or help please!

Some will provide enough power for your needs, while some won't. You didn't mention the brand of your power supply. Another thing to look for is overheating. What cpu temperatures does your system show? Do you have adequate case ventilation?

MotherBoard is Asus P4 V-800, CPU is P4 2.66Ghz. I replaced the power supply but the problem still occurs. Anyone know an alternative?
