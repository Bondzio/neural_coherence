hello there, i am our companies it purchasing tech.
i can tell you that if you are interested in a dell computer - the best offers they make are in january of each year.
so, if you are looking to buy a computer in say, november - i would wait until january.
if you are looking in say, february - you probably won't want to wait that long.
also, at least with their business division, they seem to have much more leeway when it comes to shipping costs so i would definetly &quot;ask&quot; if you are speaking with a &quot;live&quot; dell sales person.
good luck!
