Another thing you could do before trying to format is to restore your pc to an earlier date.
Go to start, programs, accessories, system tools, syatem restore and then choose a back date to restore your machine.
I would choose a date at least one month before the date wheh you started to notice your machine slowing down.
Remember after restoring, you may have to install the software which you may have installed after the restore date you choose.
Hope this helps.
