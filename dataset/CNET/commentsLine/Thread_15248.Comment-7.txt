maybe i'm confused here.
what is it that you want to do?
if you want to resize or delete a partition, that will always run the risk of damaging the os installation; and if damaged, it is likely you will need to reinstall everything.
if you want to pay money to resize/delete the partition, partition magic will do it.
otherwise, removing the second partition by using the windows xp cd is free, but you will have to reinstall the os, drivers, all programs, and personal files.
