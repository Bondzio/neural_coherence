i have 2 xp machines running sp1.
yesterday they were working fine.
i could connect from either direction.
today if i try to connect to computer a from computer b i get the network path was not found error.
i have not ran any updates nor do i have a firewall.
permissions are setup just fine on each computer.
i can connect to computer b from computer a just fine.
i have internet connnection and everything seems to be working fine.
i am connected with an eight port switch.
i have been working fine for several months now and i just don't know what could have caused this.
any ideas?
