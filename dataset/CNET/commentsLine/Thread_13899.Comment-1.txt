i have a &quot;d-link&quot; cable router with 4 port.
i have 2 pc's, both xp-home and an xbox.
i've had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said &quot;cable not connected&quot;.
same message on all 3. i checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router.
i saw a reset button on the router, nothing.
what should i look at now?
a new router?
i'm hoping someone has an idea.
thanks
