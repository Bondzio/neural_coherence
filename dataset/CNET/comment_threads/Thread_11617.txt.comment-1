I'm not familiar with sata.
I'm building my first system and I don't know if you can run your operating system off of a sata drive or not.
If you can, is partitioning and everything different, if so, how?Also, my asus p4p800 e mobo doesn't support ieee 1394 firewire.
What PCI firewire card can I buy, which I can hook up my firewire port built into my case to.
Thanks for any help anyone can give.
