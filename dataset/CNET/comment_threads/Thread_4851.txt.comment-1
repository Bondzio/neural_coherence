Hello guys .

!
This is my first topic on this forum.
I am newbie to this networking.
I really need your help you guys.
Recently, I bought D-Link DIR 300 Router for internet sharing.
The router is connected to my bro's desktop which directly connects to internet through modem.
I share the internet through Wireless from my laptop.
Now we both wanna share files and stream videos.
Could anyone please tell me how to do this ?
?
