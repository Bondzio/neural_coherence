I've never tried using a different type of ram other than what the motherboard calls for.
However I found the recent disscusion of switching DDR RAM to SD RAM or visa versa interesting!
So can anyone tell me other than the Name, Number of pins, and the positioning of the slots on the ram where it connects to the motherboard.
What is the real difference?
One other thing I know you if your looking to use faster ram than is currently installed to check with the motherboard manufacturer because most will except more than one speed as long as it is the same overall type such as changing DDR ram pc 2100 to DDR ram pc 3200 on the computer that I built is allowed.
