all you need is 1 cable.
cable... if you are using a stereo receiver... you will need a 'y' cable the 'v' part is 2 rca male and the other end is a cable looking like your stereo headphone for your portable cd player.
note that there are 2 line on the lower part of this plug the 2 lines means stereo, 1 line means mono.
you want stereo.
check your record player and see what the output or audio out jack looks like.
how to plug in the cable... on the stereo receiver or record player plug (usually it is a rca jack) the cable into audio out left and right of the player.
left stands for left speaker , right stands for right speaker.
the other end usually a 1 pin (looks like your portable stereo headphone jack) stereo male cable note the 2 line on the tip of the pin the 2 line stands for stereo (please correct me if i am wrong).
next you will need software that can help you do the sound transfer.
this will be real time so patience is a must.
1st do a little test , test a few seconds of recording then play it back if all ok then do the whole song.
or unless you just bought a turn table with usb plug.
this is a new technology that can be used to do lp conversion.
hope this helps
