Message said couldn't find the drivers, does anyone have an idea where I can find the drivers or how to fix the problem. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

I have an old SimpleTech external harddrive (100 Gig - Yes that old, it was huge when I bought it) and it is still recognized by my Gateway windows 7 computer bought about a year and half ago to replace the PC my wife was using. You can try the SimpleTech site but most USB hardware either holds its own basic drivers in a bit of flash memory the system treats like a usb stick or windows has them itself. Dave
