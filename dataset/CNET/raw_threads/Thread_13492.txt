7802	1	383517	3250679	3250474	Coryphaeus	2/18/10 4:34 PM	1.26651084E12	I have seven Seagates . . .	All PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording), in two PCs, two laptops and external drives in USB-2 cases or backups of existing internal operating hard drives. Not one of them are the &quot;bundled&quot; external drives, as such they are internal drives in external cases. I've had zero failures.
