1.1.1	I recently was upgraded at work to Windows 2000 .	St
1.1.2	I have a Lexmark E238 pinter .	St
1.1.3	Prior to upgrade , I was able to print documents with no problems .	St
1.1.4	Since the upgrade , when printing saved documents in Wordperfect 8 , I get & quot ; gibberish & quot ; language - the characters look like playing card suits , and emoticons .	St
1.1.5	Strangely I have no problems with documents I just type out and have not save .	St
1.1.6	I downloaded the updated driver for the printer .	St
1.1.7	This does not happen in any other programs .	St
1.1.8	Is is possible for a communication problem with Corel and Lexmark ?	Ques
1.1.9	Or Corel/Lexmark/Windows ?	Ques
1.1.10	Can any one help ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thank you for any assistance .	St
1.2.1	try updating the drivers , and I think you will have to use one of the PS ( post script ) ones .	Sug
1.3.1	& gt ; & gt ; try updating the drivers , and I think you will have to use one of the PS ( post script ) ones. & lt ; & lt ; Thanks for suggestion , unfortunately I already tried this .	St
1.3.2	It is definately the printer and Wordperfect .	St
1.3.3	I switched with co-worker and her printer ( HP ) worked fine .	St
1.3.4	I may have to see if we can make switch permanent or see if boss will spring for new printer .	St
1.3.5	But will would like to see if I can resolve it first .	St
1.4.1	Have you get the drivers from Corel or such ?	Ques
1.5.1	Someone suggested using a universal driver PCL driver for the printer .	St
1.5.2	I figured it could n't be any worse than what I had so I found it at Lexmark , downloaded it , clicked on the exe file and let it do its work .	St
1.5.3	One thing in case anyone has the same problem is it told me to click on & quot ; add new printer & quot ; , and not to choose a manufacturer but to just click on & quot ; have disk & quot ; .	St
1.5.4	( I kept on picking the exact printer name I had ) .	St
1.5.5	Went to the folder that was created after I click the exe and follow the path to the inf file .	St
1.5.6	The system named the printer Lexmark Universal not Lexmark E238 ( which is what I kept trying to call it ) .	St
1.5.7	In case anyone needs it the name of file would be : Lexmark_UD0_2KXP03_x86_PCL_Emul_sys_en.exe Not sure how to post the link for it but the description under it is & quot ; Lexmark Lexmark Universal PCL Emulation system driver & quot ; .	St
1.5.8	Thanks for all help .	St
1.5.9	BTW , will also keep in mind about the drivers for corel .	St
1.5.10	I 'll track them down in case I need them for the future .	St
