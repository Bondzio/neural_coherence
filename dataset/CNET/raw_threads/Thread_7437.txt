9868	0	236769	2420442	NR	EFisher506	3/4/07 10:02 AM	1.17300252E12	CPU Trouble	I recently built a new machine. The processors I chose was an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core, 5200+. Up until yesterday, everything was fine. I was running at optimal processor speed and when I checked Properties of My Computer, it reported as much. Today, I logged in and checked Properties of My Computer for a totally seperate reason and saw that the CPU was being reported as running at 996MHz instead of the usualy 2.6GHz. My mobo came with a utility that I can run to dynamically bump the speed of my CPU up, but I am reluctant to try it, as I have no experience overclocking. What could cause this change? Should I be concerned about it? Should I make the change in the utility I have, or is there another utility I can use? Please help, Eric
