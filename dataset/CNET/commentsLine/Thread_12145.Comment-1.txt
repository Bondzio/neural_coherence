my old computer caught on fire and i'm hoping that the hd still has it's programs and documents on it.
i was told to go and get a hd enclosure for my old ide drive.
i am a novice at this... my new computer is running windows 7 and the old one was running windows xp professional.
can i still use the hd enclosure with 2 different systems?
is there anything i need to know before i go buy one?
also, will i be able to take programs off of the old hd i.e.
photoshop cs2, ms office?
