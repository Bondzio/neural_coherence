<s> For the past couple of months my Windows ME had been getting slower and slower and freezing up in spite of the fact that I keep Temp files cleaned out, AV & Spybot S&D updated and regularly use other utilities. </s>
<s> Yesterday I noticed the Desktop clock began slowing down. </s>
<s> I installed a new CMOS battery, checked BIOS settings and restarted. </s>
<s> Now the system and programs run faster and more dependable than in the passed year and system resources hold up better. </s>
<s> It's a 4 1/2 year old Gateway 800 running the OEM Windows ME. </s>
<s> Could the new CMOS battery be the cause of the sudden upgrade in performance? </s>
<s> Not complaining, just curious. </s>
<s> Short answer: NO Why, that isn't as easy as it seems. </s>
<s> The CMOS battery does hold bios info setting and if they started not act accordingly it could cause a problem, but its not suppose to as long as battery life is present even if weak. </s>
<s> It should really start to fail, not slow down and usually a slow clock is the result and nothing else, excluding any other reference to &quot;timing&quot;. </s>
<s> If the timing is wholly dependant then yes, because the clock cycles take longer and in fact allow the system to slow down, as the system is dependant on those &quot;cycle rates&quot;. </s>
<s> Its logic at it worse, working but not at the rated value. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> That you cleaned out the dust and dust bunnies when you replaced the battery. </s>
<s> Intel CPUs can slow down when they get too hot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The battery is only used when the pc is powered off, if the battery is getting wear some of the setting may changed. </s>
<s> When you put in a new battery and checked the bios settings the bios program may have scaned every thing and did a &quot;refresh&quot; of the settings for clock speed memeory speed etc. </s>
<s> So now it's back at a perfomrance setting. </s>
<s> But with out knowing the pc make and bios type it's haed to tell. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> the fan would take care of all the heat problems. </s>
<s> I guess not. </s>
<s> Guess I need to get off my butt a little more often. </s>
<s> the computer usually runs 24/7. </s>
<s> Even though the battery was out for a few hours turns out the BIOS settings didn't change at all. </s>
<s> But I did have to reset the BIOS jumper to reboot. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> When you start a post with the words Windows ME then you have already answered your own questions. </s>
<s> At least my experience with ME has been a nightmare. </s>
<s> I had it for a few months when it first came out then went back to W98. </s>
