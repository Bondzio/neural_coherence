<s> I'm trying to extend my wifi. </s>
<s> I read lots of articles. </s>
<s> But I can't the repeater to work. </s>
<s> Here's my setup. </s>
<s> A PC downstairs, hard wired to a Wi-Fi modem/router. </s>
<s> I got a new PC for upstairs. </s>
<s> The main router is a Actiontec m1424wr rev 1. </s>
<s> The usb adaptor for the PC upstairs is a netgear n150 wna1100. </s>
<s> A Netgear n150 wnr1000 Wi-Fi router is going to be the repeater. </s>
<s> Instead of running 50 feet of cable, I decided to do it wireless. </s>
<s> The new PC is getting 65Mbps. </s>
<s> My tablet, when I use it upstairs. </s>
<s> I get anywhere between 5-65 Mbps. </s>
<s> When I use the tablet downstairs, I get 65Mbps. </s>
<s> But on the tablet, I get lots of signal dropping when I'm upstairs. </s>
<s> But not downstairs. </s>
<s> So I want to use a repeater. </s>
<s> Here's how I sat it up, which did not work. </s>
<s> The actiontech ip pool I 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.254 1. </s>
<s> The router actiontech ip is 192.168.1.1 2. </s>
<s> I changed the netgear to 192.168.1.50 3. </s>
<s> I turn off DHCP on the netgear. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> In order to set the gateway. </s>
<s> I had to use a static ip. </s>
<s> So I used 192.168.1.50, that would be the netgear new ip anyway. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Then I had to set the subnet. </s>
<s> So I did 255.255.255.0, the same as the router. </s>
<s> 6 . </s>
<s> It asked for the mac of the main router. </s>
<s> I put that in. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Then I did the gateway. </s>
<s> The same as the actiontech 192.168.1.1 8. </s>
<s> Then I had to manually put in the DNS settings. </s>
<s> It wouldn't automatically get it. </s>
<s> If you want to try repeaters, try a few but be sure you can return them but my fix time after time to use the router as a WAP. </s>
<s> Even if I can't get the WAP too far away from the router it often helps. </s>
<s> How did you address channels? </s>
<s> With 802.11n 40MHz ODFM you get 1 channel so did you pull that back to 20? </s>
<s> More at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels Bob </s>
<s> &quot; With 802.11n 40MHz ODFM you get 1 channel so did you pull that back to 20?&quot; I have no idea what that means. </s>
<s> The actiontech I put on channel, netgear channel 6. </s>
<s> I'm just going to wire the two routers, and put the netgear upstairs, Cause right now. </s>
<s> I'm downloaded about 25 videos, altogether it comes out to about 3GB. </s>
<s> 2 hours later, it's still downloading. </s>
<s> Every store around me, they want $30 and up for a 50 foot cable. </s>
<s> What kind of cable would I need? </s>
<s> I've seen cross over, straight through, patch cables. </s>
<s> Which kind of devices are used for each kind of those cables? </s>
<s> Now I can use the same SSID as downstairs. </s>
<s> And roam seamlessy with my tablet. </s>
<s> And what, if any settings would I have to change. </s>
<s> Besides the routers IP. </s>
<s> Also going through the netgear, can I still access my actiontech? </s>
<s> I know I have to change the netgear ip, I'll just change that to 192.168.1.2 And turn off DNS. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> Or do I have to do something else? </s>
<s> I can also use wpa2? </s>
<s> When I'm using that wireless connection. </s>
<s> How does that work? </s>
<s> It it just sending the signal from my tablet, to the netgear. </s>
<s> Then that signal send it down the wire to the actiontech? </s>
<s> Or is it going from the tablet, to the netgear wifi, then to the actiontech? </s>
<s> Another thing. </s>
<s> Why when I replied to your question, it was asking for a subject title? </s>
<s> I'm posting in the same thread. </s>
<s> So you could read why I wrote that. </s>
<s> This idea of seamless roaming is junk. </s>
<s> I've yet to see it work for example, watching some netflix and roam to another hotspot. </s>
<s> It drops dead. </s>
<s> About the subject title, it's required but do we want to discuss forum nuances or router setups? </s>

<s> The subject line was just a question that had nothing to do with my main question. </s>
<s> But what do I need to change in the Netgear router. </s>
<s> I know the wireless won't be that seamless, but if the ssid's are the same. </s>
<s> Won't it just look like one network for the wireless. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> So I never bother to make the SSIDs match. </s>
<s> That way I know which point it connected to. </s>
<s> If you setup this as the more common router as a WAP then it's still one WLAN and LAN. </s>
<s> That's what most folk want. </s>
<s> Since I never found the repeater mode to be reliable I don't deploy such. </s>
<s> I find it best to let others do that so the clients flame them instead of me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The words Router As A WAP on google finds the usual setup I use. </s>
<s> I don't write how here because I find some folk can't take my explanation and since members can find the article that makes sense to them, I offer the words for google instead. </s>
<s> I just paid $7.04 for a straight through 50 foot Cat 5 cable from a company in Chesterfield Missouri. </s>
<s> Wish I could remember the name. </s>
<s> I can post it when the cable gets here. </s>
<s> It's not another Amazon or EBay, or Walmart. </s>
<s> They actually make cable. </s>
