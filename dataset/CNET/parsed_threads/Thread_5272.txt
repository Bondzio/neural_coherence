<s> The never ending question - always a pain unless someone needs an answer. </s>
<s> I do. </s>
<s> I want a Tablet, something at least as good as the Acer 500 that a friend has. </s>
<s> His tablet, like the one I want, is used principally to store edited photographs for display, use as appointment list, not to use for games, other than perhaps backgammon and chesss, but no action games. </s>
<s> Will use for films, probably on an additional stick if required. </s>
<s> I am not technically minded and will probably take ages getting a tablet sorted out after my friend helps me. </s>
<s> Don't think I want Apple, but is ther something better than the Asus 500, possibly the Asus EE Transformer Infinity or the like if that's better than the 500 mentioned. </s>
<s> I woudl also like to be able to sync with a DSLR, either by cable or Wi-Fi, but could live without that. </s>
<s> Any helpful people care to give me some ideas please. </s>

<s> The TF300 for example has SD and MicroSD card slots so I could move pictures from the camera over. </s>
<s> I have yet to see if I can use Eye-Fi to do this. </s>
<s> However I would get a small laptop for the price. </s>
<s> Why the tablet for this use? </s>
<s> Don't see the attraction. </s>
