1.1.1	I have been using Bluetooth for a few years now but it was always &quot;simple&quot; pairing of a PDA to my computer or a headset to a cell phone.	St
1.1.2	I bought a BT stereo headset hoping that I could pair the headset to my computer and phone so I could stream the audio from my computer while connected to my phone at the same time.	St
1.1.3	I got the pairing done with the phone, works fine.	St
1.1.4	I paired it with my computer but, even though it says it's connected, there's no sound from the headset.	St
1.1.5	This is the first time that I've tried to do something like this so I don't know exactly what to look for.	St
1.1.6	I have a Windows XP SP2 PC with a Linksys USB BT adapter (USBBT100) and the headset is a Motorola HT820.	St
1.1.7	I've had the adapter for a long time so maybe it doesn't support what I'm trying to accomplish.	St
1.1.8	Any advice, direction, help is appreciated.	St
1.2.1	Partially due to Microsoft's half hearted adoption and the other to the Bluetooth consortium.	St
1.2.2	Both are closed shops and with the dog eat dog nature of Bluetooth development (don't ask me why I know this) you are unlikely to find any real fix.	St
1.2.3	The adapter is also only BT 1.1 http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1119460478394&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper so it will never have STEREO.	St
1.2.4	If you want to pursue this, look at google.com and use the words SKYPE PC BLUETOOTH.	St
1.2.5	Good luck, Bob	St
