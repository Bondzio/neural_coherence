<s> Well, I've got a rather interesting problem, that so far, has stumped everyone who has worked on it. </s>
<s> My computer that I just finished building will only send a completely black signal to my monitor. </s>
<s> After talking to one of my friends, we decided that the problem might be in that the monitor was screwed up, and wasn't working. </s>
<s> So, I hooked it up to the monitor I'm using now, and nothing. </s>
<s> Once I did that, we figured the problem might be in that its just not sending a signal at all. </s>
<s> So, using the same method, I hooked it up to another monitor, and it doesn't give me the &quot;no signal&quot; message. </s>
<s> If you're going to say that its only not giving me that because its plugged into a grounded outlet, you're wrong, this monitor has a problem in it that doesn't have it check from grounding, it only checks for a signal going into it. </s>
<s> So, right now, we're all stumped, I'm hoping you can help me. </s>
<s> Get your hands on a simple video card, pci type or an older one that works, then connect monitor to it. </s>
<s> If you can then see any display, its your orginal video port or card is bad. </s>
<s> With power off remove the just tested card, working or not, and find on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> the CMOS clearing pins. </s>
<s> Check your manual or online support website to locate them. </s>
<s> Follow the instructions and just monetarily short them when applying power. </s>
<s> This should cause the CMOS(bios) to return to default vales. </s>
<s> See, if the orginal video port/card can now access a display. </s>
<s> Of course if a card, make darn sure its fully seated. </s>
<s> If can see a display, reboot to access the bios screen area. </s>
<s> Verify the bios reflects it has choosen what is your proper video out source. </s>
<s> If can see any display with orginal port/card things are working. </s>
<s> If not, but with the old card, then that suggests the orginal port/card is bad. </s>
<s> However, I have seen this problem if you don't install the latest video drivers and/or bios updates. </s>
<s> Check to reseat the monitor cable, plus look at connector for no bent/pushed in, broken pins. </s>
<s> Of course use a working monitor tested good elsewhere to eliminate that. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> How am I supposed to reinstall bios or drivers? </s>
<s> I can't see anything thats going on!?! </s>
<s> I'll try using the video card though, that may just work. </s>
<s> I do have a SLIGHT suspicion of what it might be though. </s>
<s> most of the parts I built this computer out of I got for free, and I believe that one of the computers I took parts out of may have had some unbelievably nasty virus, so bad it was inground onto the hardware. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if any of that computer is in this one, but I do know that a 3.5&quot; floppy drive has its magnetic control removed, so any disk put in it is magnetically wiped... but only if its hooked up and on. </s>
