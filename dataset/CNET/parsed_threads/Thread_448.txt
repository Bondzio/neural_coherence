<s> Hello everybody, I'm asking for your help in locating a unique case for my next build. </s>
<s> I'm looking for the following features: 1. </s>
<s> Right side window (which means the mobo will be inverted) 2. </s>
<s> Four USB connections (preferably near the top) that can be accessed without opening a door/panel 3. </s>
<s> Two 3.5 external bays (one for a floppy for SATA & one for a card reader) 4. </s>
<s> Black, Silver or 2-tone 5. </s>
<s> Price range up to $139 6. </s>
<s> Power supply is optional 7. </s>
<s> Oh, and something unique, but not TOO flashy or dorky! </s>
<s> LOL I've found a few, but nothing that matches perfectly. </s>
<s> Two of the AeroCools come close, the Masstige and the Spiral Galaxies. </s>
<s> The Silverstone Temjin TJ06 comes mighty close and the Enermax CS-718 looks VERY good. </s>
<s> Since you guys are the experts, I thought I'd turn to you and see if there are any deals to be had out there that fit this criteria. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I can't advise you on your case, but I do know that some motherboards have heatpipes that don't function properly when upside down. </s>
<s> Just making sure you have this issue covered. </s>
<s> Yeah, I read that somewhere else. </s>
<s> I'm curious as to why turning the heatpipes upside down would decrease their ability to discipate heat. </s>
<s> Hmmm....OK, thanks for the insight! </s>
<s> [gravitational force] is what causes air movement via natural convection. </s>
<s> [hot air rises] Can't use natural convection in a satellite because of zero gravity. </s>
<s> BTX type. </s>
<s> Why not stick with ATX? </s>
<s> Intel has vertually failed to convince anyone to go to BTX configiuration. </s>
<s> Else find a BTX type mobo [good luck]. </s>
<s> there is only one acceptable direction of the heat [air]flow to move heat from the CPU to the heatsink. </s>
<s> Thus the force to move the heated air is generated in the vertical legs of the heat pipes. </s>
<s> Inverting them would cause the flow in the wrong direction. </s>
