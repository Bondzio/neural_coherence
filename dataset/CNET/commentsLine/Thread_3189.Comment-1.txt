i bought this video card: nvidia geforce4 mx 420 for my computer to support all my pc games.
i have never had a problem until now.
when i installed call of duty 2, i got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending, which was strange to me because i have two other call of duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem.
i looked at the nvidia web site to see about downloading an update, but i'm nervous about picking the correct one.
can anybody tell me which download is the right one?
