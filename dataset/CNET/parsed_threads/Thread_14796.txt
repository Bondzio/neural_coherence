<s> Hi, I am getting different answers from different people. </s>
<s> Could anyone shine some light on me please? </s>
<s> I am using a cable modem to connect to the internet, and I need wired internet access for 2 PC's (one Vista and one XP). </s>
<s> I don't have LAN configured, and I don't want the two PC's to be connected to each other. </s>
<s> The tech from my ISP told me that I just need a hub or switch, but the rep at the computer store told me that I need a LAN in order to use the switch, so if I don't want a LAN I should use a wired router instead. </s>
<s> So, do I need a router or a switch? </s>
<s> Also, if I connect more than one PC's to the router or switch, is the connection speed going to drop? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> You will have a LAN unless you want to pay for a second cable modem. </s>
<s> Chaching. </s>
<s> Why not a router and be done? </s>
<s> I would use a router. </s>
<s> If you don't configure the 2 computers to talk to each other..then they won't. </s>
<s> Use a router. </s>
<s> I would go one step further and get a wireless. </s>
<s> You can just disable the wireless side and not use it until needed. </s>
<s> Most router also give you extra security with NAT and SPI firewalls. </s>
<s> Your speed will not go down on the wired ports of the router, but the wireless side will if you decide to use that. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions! </s>
<s> Looks like the guy at the computer store is correct then, I will go ahead and get a router. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
