i'm in the process of upgrading my entire system's hardware and would like to transfer the data from 2 pata hardrives to the new sata hardrive that is in the new system.
the two old drives are both western digital, the new one is a seagate.
whats the easiest way to transfer data between the old and new hardrives?
both the old and new systems are or will be running xp pro.
can i install xp on the new system using the xp disc that was installed on the old one, without running into licensing problems?
or would i be better off installing a fresh xp disc on the new system?
the data i want to transfer is saved games for the kids, pictures, and videos.
thanks for any help.
