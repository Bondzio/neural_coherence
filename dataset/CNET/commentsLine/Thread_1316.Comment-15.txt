i kind of rely on pc's as file servers and transducers.
i use nvidia graphics cards to drive through hdmi or svideo depending on which room.
i use soundblaster x-fi sound cards and creative digital io modules to connect my pc's to home theatre receivers via spdif cable.
on the speaker end i use klipsch lascala ii's and heresy iii's to make things really entertaining.
i have one linux machine with a bit over 1tb of storage, broadcasting smb so the windows machines can mount it as a share and grab clips and movies.
