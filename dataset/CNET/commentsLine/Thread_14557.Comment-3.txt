try going to radio shack see if there is a universal adapter kit that might work.
the critical points are the input fitting (size) and dc voltage, best to take them with if you decide to try this.
oddly enough i had an old scanner laying around a while back and the inverter had gone south, went to radio shack, did a match up and it worked.
just a thought.
again, the fitting and voltage (dc) are the critical issues.
