My boot drive is an EIDE and my secondary drive, (the one that's having issues) is a SATA drive.
Sorry for leaving out the information.
I tried changing the cables out and took out the CMOS battery with no luck.
I didn't think about trying to run the diags on the other computer.
(Thanks Willy) I did back up important information on a 3rd hd in the other computer so if it's going it will be o.k.
I'll go try running the diags while the hd is in the other computer.
If anyone has any other ideas please let me know.
Thank You so much
