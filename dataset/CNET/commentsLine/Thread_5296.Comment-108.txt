intrgrated graphics is a poor choice unless you don't plan on upgrading or play any real games.
you need to do real research b4 you give advice.and how many ppl have ddr5 speed motherboards anyway.
not many so they havent flooded the market with ddr5 memory yet.
there arent any games than &quot;need&quot; it unless you getting payed to play or in comatition.
criysis plays fine on 12 gb ddr3 ram and 2 nvida 9600. oh i also have an i7 procdesser.
