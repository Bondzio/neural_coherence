have used maxtor 80gb (2+ years & quiet), second 80gb (1+ year & noisy) & new 120gb (3 months which repeatedly clicked before finally freezing my pc after a few minutes).
now back on the original 2x 80gb hdds & no problems.
maxtor's v4.21 test software reports the new 120gb as error free, but i don't trust it so it's next to useless.
maxtor won't replace it as i can't give them an error message.
result: no more maxtor drives for us or our clients in the future!
