The goal is to build a budget/low end HTPC. I don't know if I have a need for an HTPC and really just want to do the build for fun/curiosity. It may end up as a general purpose desktop when it is all said and done. What would be desirable specs for a processor in a build like this?&lt;div&gt; I sifted through processors on Newegg and made a list of processors with 65W or less, most current sockets, and $100 or less with up to $125 as a grey zone. This leaves the Celeron G530/540, Pentium G600 &amp; G800 series, Athlon II X2 series &amp; X3 400e series, AMD A4 APUs and the A6 3500 APU. The i3-2100 is in the grey zone. I currently am leaning toward the A6-3500. Are there any big downsides to going with it vs an Athlon II X2/X3, Pentium G800 series, or i3 2100?&lt;div&gt; I purposely left out discussing form factor to keep this post shorter. I plan on starting a thread when I look into motherboards. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If it's just to play content on some HDMI 1080 display, then pair up any CPU you listed with the fanless ATI 5450 card and you are there. Bob

They way I understand it, transcoding on the fly would be taking a video file saved as one format and convert it to a different format so that a certain program can display it all while the program is playing the video and the file would not be resaved in the new format? Would transcoding not on the fly then be converting the file to a different format, saving it, and then playing the newly saved file? Is it common to need to transcode on the fly? Wouldn't you be able to get around this need by choosing a program that could display the original format? I think I would mostly use the machine for streaming HD video and playing saved DVD/BluRay content. It would be unlikely, at least early on to transcode on the fly. If I get into it that much, I would likely just look into building a new machine. Final question: What level of processor would do away with the need for a discrete graphics card for 1080p viewing? I was under the impression they were not needed with any A series APU. I'm not against a discrete card, just trying to get a feel for cost/benefit. Thanks Dylan

As to streaming, if the file is to be streamed, then we don't need that powerful card or CPU. We're moving bytes down the pipe and not much else. I think the CPU and the 5450 would be a great solution. Bob
