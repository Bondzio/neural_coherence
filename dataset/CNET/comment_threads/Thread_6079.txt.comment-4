Ask me about my home improvement projects some day.
Just a few ago I couldn't shake the line &quot;Paint the fence&quot; from my mind as I gave the house a new paint job all by myself.
Funny how movie scenes and lines come back when I do these projects.
&quot;The Money Pit&quot; came to mind a few times as well.
