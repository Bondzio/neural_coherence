1.1.1	I currently have a ATI x1900xtx graphics card and i was going to get a new motherboard ( Crossfire ) but are game today needing that much power or am i best just upgrading to one card like Nvidia 8800 gtx .	St
1.1.2	Do any games need more power then the 8800 can offer or is it just wasted .	St
1.1.3	Please any tips Meny thanks again	Polite
1.2.1	if you run at 1280x1024 or lower , then your x1900xtx can handle any just about any game thrown at it with high settings as well as an 8800gts .	St
1.2.2	if you run at 1680x1050 or 1600x1200 , the xtx could begin struggling compared to an 8800gts .	St
1.2.3	anything higher and you 'll definitely need to start dialing back the graphics settings .	St
1.2.4	another $ 400 for an xtx and $ 120 for a crossfire mobo is almost the price of a 8800gtx .	St
1.2.5	since the gtx is as fast as 2 xtx , its the better and simpler upgrade choice .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply Im running my pc on a 32 inch HD tv i normally play games as high as the settings on the game will go with its highest resolution .	St
1.3.2	So it would be much easy just to upgrade to the 8800 gtx and i should be able to run any game quite ok. just one more question will there ever be needed for me to upgrade to sli or crossfire or are single graphics powerful enough to cope with games in the future Meny thanks	Ques
