when i realized, last month, that the hard drive on my laptop may have been on its way out i purchased an 8gb flash drive and transferred all of my file to it.
i was surprised at how much capacity was remaining, so i transferred all of the desktop files to it, and there's still plenty of &quot;room&quot; remaining.
i didn't know that transferring back to my computer from the external hard drive may be problematic, and i thank you very much for this information.
basically, we have files for my husband's business which consists of mostly word and pdf documents and jpeg and tif image files.
and we have digital photo files for mostly personal, but some business, use.
am i correct in assuming that i should, instead of investing in an external hard drive, keep using the flash drive as a primary backup and periodically transfer those files to a dvd for permanent storage?
