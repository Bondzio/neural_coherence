<s> Is it possible for a computer to have a bad temperature sensor? </s>
<s> My computer keeps reading that it is way too hot (80 C) and shuts down. </s>
<s> The only thing is, nothing seems to actually be warm. </s>
<s> The case is cool. </s>
<s> The drives and the heatsink are barely even warm to the touch. </s>
<s> (right after shutdown) I've had this system for about 8 months now. </s>
<s> The first 6 months there were no problem at all. </s>
<s> The past couple months this overheat problem has gotten progressively worse. </s>
<s> At first I just opened it up and gave it a good cleaning. </s>
<s> There was a little bit of dust but not really a lot. </s>
<s> Then I added another fan to the system. </s>
<s> A 120mm 3400 RPM fan to the back of the tower blowing out. </s>
<s> As the power supply didn't seem to be moving a whole lot of air. </s>
<s> But it is still doing it, and I can't figure out why. </s>
<s> This summer I might have been able to understand, but it is winter now and it is acting up. </s>
<s> It isn't anywhere where any of the furnace vents blow anywhere near it. </s>
<s> The system has Mach Speed Viper MK8-939A Socket 939 Motherboard AMD Sempron 3000+ Socket 939 CPU Masscool AMD K8 Cooler Fan Ultra 350w V-Series PSU 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz RAM and a Pine Xabre 200 32MB AGP video card DVD writer CD writer floppy drive and 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> The tower is sitting on top of my desk, about 6 inches from the wall and about 8 inches from the monitor, so I don't think anything is blocking the airflow. </s>
<s> I don't do any gaming on this computer and nothing has been added, so I really can't understand what the problem could be. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The 350 Watt power supply is likely working overtime and when you push such supplies near their limits you see more heat produced. </s>
<s> I don't bother with less than 450 and in fact fitted my home systems with cheap 680 Watt units from a discount house. </s>
<s> I do not expect them to deliver 680 but at most I see is under 400 at peak. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Skip the addition of fans and leave the side cover off till you cure it. </s>
<s> Here's a common case mod that really works. </s>

<s> Are you saying the processor temp is high ...if yes..how high ? </s>
<s> CPU case temp is high ? </s>
<s> If yes, how high ? </s>
<s> If it's the case temp...try another measuring device..like an indoor thermometer. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The Smartguardian software that came with the MB is what is telling me the temp. </s>
<s> Not sure where it is reading it from. </s>
<s> All I know is when it gets up around 80C the computer just shuts down on it's own. </s>
<s> I think it is some kind of MB or processor safeguard to keep it from getting fried. </s>
<s> Like I said though, the really odd thing, is that nothing feels warm to the touch. </s>
<s> Think I will try a bigger power supply next. </s>
<s> This is the one that came packaged with everything else so I figured it should be big enough. </s>
<s> (bought it from Tiger Direct as a kit) </s>
<s> Leaving the cover off for a test run often helps in determining if heat is the issue. </s>
<s> Once in awhile people pass on this test, run off and start buying more parts. </s>
<s> Why is that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have tried running it with the case open. </s>
<s> Doesn't help. </s>
<s> If I leave the side cover off completely it heats up a little faster. </s>
<s> If I just leave it cracked open a little bit it heats up the same. </s>
<s> The reason I agreed with the suggestion of replacing the power supply is because after checking the specs I think it is the culprit. </s>
<s> (I should have mentioned that in my last post) Seems the power supply iteself has 'Thermal Overload Cutoff Protection' So that is probably what is saying it is too hot and shutting the power down. </s>
<s> Besides 350W isn't that much. </s>
<s> (for some reason I was thinking I had a 450W) For $20 or less I figure it is worth a shot. </s>
<s> Better than frying something in the computer due to the sudden shutdowns and having to replace that also. </s>
<s> Thank you for posting your thoughts though. </s>
<s> how can it be too much 80C </s>
<s> Thermaltake TR2 W0070RUC ATX 430W Power Supply but u will have to increase ur budjet a lot till 37$ chk dis: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817153023 </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip, but I can easily get 450W for under $20 from several sources. </s>
<s> Looking around at 550-650W right now. </s>
<s> Seems to be between $25-35 price range. </s>
<s> Just trying to decide what I want at the moment. </s>
<s> The oldest is 2 years old but I have no delusions that it could deliver 680 Watts for very long. </s>
<s> But I bet it can do 400+ without a sweat. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> With your entire system depending on the PSU to deliver the power needed to run it efficiently and reliably...cheap PSUs are not the bargain they appear to be. </s>
<s> You'll probably spend more on electricity in the first year with a cheap PSU versus a good quality efficient PSU and never realize why. </s>
<s> Getting a better quality, efficient PSU is a path worth pursuing unless you're looking for more problems. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS..that software you mentioned should tell you the whether the reading is the CPU itself or the motherboard. </s>
<s> If you can't find out for sure....run the system for awhile ...restart the system and check the BIOS CPU temp readings. </s>
<s> While it could be the PSU..it could be faulty installation or functioning of the HS FAN. </s>
<s> That is my thinking as well. </s>
<s> The 350W must have been just adiquate to last the 6 months that it did. </s>
<s> So anything bigger will probably handle my power requirements. </s>
<s> Ended up going for a 550W unit for just under $20 shipped. </s>
<s> That makes it almost 60% more than my current unit. </s>
<s> I think it will suffice. </s>
<s> The software says it is the CPU temp, but I don't believe that is correct. </s>
<s> As I mentioned with the software reading 80C, right after shutdown I can put my fingers on the heat sink and it is barely warm to the touch. </s>
<s> If it were 80C it would burn my fingers. </s>
<s> Interesting point about the cheaper power supplies. </s>
<s> Will have to keep an eye on my electric bill and see if there is much of a difference after the change. </s>
<s> anyone interested in choosing a new PSU. </s>
<s> http://www.jonnyguru.com We'll look forward to hearing what you decide on. </s>

<s> Hey everyone. </s>
<s> Just wanted to let everyone know that I found the culprit and have fixed the problem. </s>
<s> Somehow the latch for the heatsink had come partially loose. </s>
<s> It looked like it was latched all the way but it wasn't. </s>
<s> Got it to move about another quarter inch. </s>
<s> Since then the temp hasn't topped 52C. </s>
<s> And I have been putting it through it's paces. </s>
<s> I am still going to upgrade the powersupply though. </s>
<s> I have a few more items I want to add to the system and there is no sense pushing that little 350W to it's limits. </s>
<s> Thank you to everyone who posted here and tried to help. </s>
