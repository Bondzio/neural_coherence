no, it did not just freeze; it went black and quiet and the sleep indicator (the powerbook had a light on the front of it that cycled up and down in brightness, sort of like a lighthouse seen from a distance, when it was asleep) came on.
i failed to mention that sometimes i was able to wake it from these sleeps by hitting keys continuously for anything from a few seconds to a few minutes, but all too often it just would not wake up, and then i would power it off as i described above and then power it up again.
thanks for the answer.
