hey all, ok i've been looking around for a while at dell, alienware and you know all those major brands for a gaming desktop.
well it was no surprise but trying to configure a high end system at those sites was very exspensive, so i started looking for alternatives.
i stumbled upon a site called ibuypower and now im wondering about the reliability of these sites?
i was amazed how i could get so much more for the same amount of money.
for me right now its a question of reliabilty, can these computers contend with alienware or dell?
do they have the same things such as software and cooling systems.
like alienware has liquid cooling but ibuypower does to, is it the same?
please help i'm really not sure where to buy.
if anyone has a site they can recommend and have bought from and can confirm that they sell top notch systems please do post the site.
thanks for the help!
p.s.
what i'm really looking for is people who have bought from ibuypower and is willing to share their experience.
=)
