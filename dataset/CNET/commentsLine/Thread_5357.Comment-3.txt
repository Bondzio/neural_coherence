welcome to the world of &quot;out sourced computer support&quot; via india or phillipnes, etc.
don't expect anything to change soon as companies save costs in such out sourcing moves.
sorry, but that's the way it is, if you like to do something about it, write(email) your local congressman(woman) and state your displeasure and/or write to dell, not email.
good luck -----willy
