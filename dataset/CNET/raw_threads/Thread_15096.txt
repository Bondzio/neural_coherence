Here are the details: It's a Netgear DG834Gv3 with the latest V4.01.40 firmware. We've tried (amongst others) WPA-PSK with a network key composed of 19 letters/numbers. We've tried broadcasting it on channels 09, 11 and 06. &quot;Enable Wireless Access Point&quot;, &quot;Allow Broadcast of Name (SSID)&quot; are checked and &quot;Wireless Isolation&quot; is unchecked. It is set to mode &quot;g & b&quot;. The Wireless Station Access list is turned off so anyone can join the network, provided they have the passphrase. The MacBook is the latest 2.1 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo with OS X 10.5.6. It has been serviced. The MacBook will connect to other wireless networks and our Netgear will connect to all our other devises but not the MacBook. It insists that the password is invalid when we select our network - either that or it just says &quot;connection timeout&quot;. We've tried disabling the Netgear security altogether but the MacBook just asks for a WEP password. Please, can anyone help us? I have no idea why it won't connect.

Proffitt	2/7/09 12:38 PM	1.23401028E12	Just a link to the current control panel for it.	http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1042.html Also try our Mac OS Forum since we have someone that is very Apple there. Sadly I'd call the router maker and lodge your complaint fast. Bob

I think it would cost more than the price of the Router.

Incidentally I've had problems connecting a friend's Mac laptop and desktop to two different routers (Zoom 802.11B, D-Link 802.11G). The laptop would connect to the Zoom but not the DLink and the Desktop would only connect to the DLink. Maybe something to do with WEP vs WPA -- we spent a week on this and gave up on the laptop. I suspect Apple want you to buy their router.

I recently set up a Netgear wireless with my MacBook and was having the same issue... I was told to set the VPI# to 0 (zero) VCI# to 32 BAM it was working. Just a thought. Hope this is right. CJG

The original setting are: Multiplexing Method: VC-BASED VPI: 0 VCI: 38 DSL Mode: Auto (Multi-mode) Are these alright?

All other computers in my home accept it but this one and I have other macs. I am not familiar with VPI & VCI could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so I can try to fix? Thank you!
