...to try one fix at a time.
i could try switching to wpa and see what happens.
by hidden ssid, do you mean hiding the network's name from view?
i haven't done that.
i want our guests to see our network's name show up on their computer, then enter the password.
would you recommend a better router to use?
the important thing to me was getting the longest range, to reach our whole building, which this one does.
thanks.
