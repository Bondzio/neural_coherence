I have seen VGA boxes like XGA but I am also looking for a new GPU and was thinking of killing 2 birds with one stone and get this... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143037 it comes with some VIVO cable and a HDTV cable. Will this fit my needs? if they don't what product will? thanks for any help.

While VIVO (Video-In, Video-Out) may look promising to connect your PS2 to said PC to play your game, many dis the display quality since you don't get much better than TV pixels. Also it may not be &quot;real-time&quot; or lag free enough. I will share that my simpler choices of PC TV/Capture cards are near realtime (games hate lag) and cost about 49 or less bucks. Bob

Plug it into a USB port on my desktop, start the TV software and set to ''device'', plug the game into the A/V plugs on the tuner card, and go for it. Any good quality internal TV card will work also.
