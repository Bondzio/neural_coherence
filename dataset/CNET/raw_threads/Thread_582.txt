It does not appear to recognise the disk (or any of a couple of others I have got lying around) but it boots ok from a CD and recognises RAM etc. any info appreciated cheers Brian

Boot from the CD with the drive installed and see if you can see it with the Disk Utility/Hard Drive Utility. It may be formatted strangely and just needs reinitialising. P
