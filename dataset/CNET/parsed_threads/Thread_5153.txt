<s> I am continually having a problem with staying connected to the Internet during idle periods on my IBM desktop. </s>
<s> I am running Windows Xp SP2, and am connected via cable modem (Time Warner Roadrunner) with an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Usually, just right clicking the connection icon in the tray and selecting Repair corrects the problem, but occasionally I have to reboot the machine. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> This is time consuming and annoying. </s>

<s> Thanks for the referral, but it's not my problem. </s>
<s> I am merely losing Internet connection. </s>
<s> I am still connected via cable, just not to the Internet. </s>
<s> Other computers using the same router do not have the problem </s>
<s> Hope the person with the problem can solve it. </s>

<s> The pest issue continues to be an amazing source of such errors. </s>
<s> There's nothing in your posts to dismiss these pests. </s>
<s> Several reasons may explain this: 1) You may have a driver problem that does not handle the network adapter correctly; This may happen is at times, you have installed a wrong driver that appears to work perfectly with the hardware. </s>
<s> 2) Your cable modem may require a firmware upgrade-consult your modem manufacturer site for more details. </s>
<s> I suppose you are using a router. </s>
<s> 3) You may have a trojan horse on your computer. </s>
<s> 4) Too many p2p software tend to burst connections. </s>
<s> I would advise you to disable p2p applications and test the connection anew. </s>
<s> In any case, I have written a small program that you can download at: http://rapidshare.com/files/4122211/loose_connec.rar.html Please send your feedback.Thank you. </s>
