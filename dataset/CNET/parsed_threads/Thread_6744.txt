<s> See if the out of warranty Gateway experience bothers you. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7596_102-0.html?hhTest=1&forumID=60&threadID=96534&start=0 for examples. </s>
<s> It is a o.k. </s>
<s> monitor. </s>
<s> The only reason people buy it is that it is one of the few 24&quot; computer monitors that has a 4 port hub and rca (analog for game stations, vcr play back etc...) What hurts it is that the contrast ratio is only 1000 and has only a 1 year warranty. </s>
<s> Find a good Samsung or Lg 24&quot; and you will find a minimum of 3000 contrast ratio and a 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> You have to determine if the extra hook-ups are important to you. </s>
<s> The new HD 2401 doesn't have the same hook-ups! </s>
<s> I own the monitor and I love it. </s>
<s> &quot; e'cept it is not a 30&quot;. </s>
<s> The contrast ratio stated is 1000:1 - All I know is it is bright, (I'm running it at about 38% and it is still very bright with very deep blacks). </s>
<s> It also has HDMI, DVI, VGA, Component, S-Video, & Composite inputs, along with Digital Sound output from the HDMI source(for the optional sound bar), & the sound bar has Analogue and Digital audio Inputs. </s>
<s> The screen has a max of 1920 X 1200 Pixels per Inch w/ Faroudja video up-converting circuit, and 3ms response time. </s>
<s> It shows 1080P easy. </s>
<s> It pivots from landscape to portrait mode, and can rise up and down about 3&quot;. </s>
<s> You can power it on without turning on your computer, to watch a external source (DVD Player, Video feed, camera feed). </s>
<s> I bought mine from HSN&gt;$899.99 + tax/shipping, with a 1.6 Gb Pentium Dual-Core, 250 Gig HD, DVD Burner, Vista...and it runs like a top! </s>
<s> They still have that same priced deal with a 320 Gig HD. </s>
<s> Gateway sells it by itself for $499.99, but check the tax/shipping/insurance costs, cause when I ordered, if I had gotten it thru them it would have cost me $750.00 delivered&gt; so the package was only $200.00 more WITH the computer. </s>
<s> In the stores, at the time, it was going for up to $799.99 by itself! </s>
<s> It has Beautiful color, and I'm very happy with mine. </s>
<s> The only things it lacks is a built in SD/HD tuner, or a remote. </s>
<s> I've 2 DVD Recorders w/ built-in tuners and remotes so that is not a problem. </s>
<s> Soon to get a HD Tuner w/HDMI. </s>
<s> This thing is a beauty!!! </s>
<s> And I do'nt work for or sell for Gateway. </s>
