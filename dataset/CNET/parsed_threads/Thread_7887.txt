<s> I have already successfully set up this printer to print pictures, fax documents, and scan, etc. </s>
<s> However, my problem is I cannot figure out how to get the printer to operate on my wireless network. </s>
<s> On the XP disc, I found and opened a utility for wireless configurations, and in the instructions, I filled out the required network info, and then it copied the files to a USB flash drive. </s>
<s> From there, I was supposed to plug the drive into the printer, which I have tried several times, but the printer does not recognize the drive unless photos are stored on it. </s>
<s> I've tried this with different flash drives with no luck. </s>
<s> I also attempted to set it up wirelessly by using my Mac, but the install CD will not even install the basic software. </s>
<s> This may be because of Leopard, as the OS X disc lists only OS 10.3 and 10.4. </s>
<s> I can get to the install portion of the installer, but if I click Install, I get a pop up asking about a customer participation thing. </s>
<s> Clicking yes or no does not affect the installer at all, and it refuses to proceed to the actual installation. </s>
<s> So, no luck there either. </s>
<s> I've looked around but I haven't found any information on this specific issue with this specific printer. </s>
<s> It does work with an Ethernet cable, but I need it to be wireless for my convenience. </s>
<s> If anyone could help with this, I'd appreciate it. </s>
<s> I've been installing/uninstalling the HP stuff off of the main PC several times to no avail. </s>
<s> And it is made by HP as well... </s>
<s> I will keep looking into it and hopefully, I can get it set up. </s>
<s> Strangely, the setup button and menus on the printer do not even hint or reference wireless capability, although it should have it as the manual and CD suggest. </s>
<s> There are several networking options, but they are for changing IP settings and the like, which I've tried. </s>
<s> Thanks for any assistance. </s>

<s> After some more checking on the printer, it may be that it is in fact, not wireless. </s>
<s> The box makes no mention of it being wireless, only that it is capable of wired transfers... </s>
<s> It may have Bluetooth networking if the printer's onboard configuration site is accurate, but that won't do much good for me. </s>
<s> Still, if anyone has any information on this particular printer's capabilities, please post them here. </s>
<s> Much appreciated. </s>
