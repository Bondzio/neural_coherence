1.1.1	I've been tracking these threads to try and get a handle on the best way to back up my music collection.	St
1.1.2	I currently have almost 50 gigs and plan to add more from my CD and album collections.	St
1.1.3	My Windows Media Player stopped working, so I'm dealing with that as well as looking to buy a new computer to replace my Pentium 4.	St
1.1.4	At the moment, my music files are all intact.	St
1.1.5	I've been backing up everything on a 350 gig WD external hard drive, but after reading all the negative stuff about externals, I'm at a loss.	St
1.1.6	Should I buy one or two more externals and keep copies in two locations?	St
1.1.7	Is on-line storage reliable in the long run?	Ques
1.1.8	Any suggestions would be much appreciated!	St
1.2.1	I have been playing with File Hamster from Mogware, My plan is to have two externals to hold everything and one drive internal.	St
1.2.2	(2 1TB drives for me and i have a 750 already internal that i will use for this.)	St
1.2.3	Keeping one external offline but local and only putting it on when needed to backup (weekly?	St
1.2.4	), and the other offsite (Quarterly).	St
1.2.5	(both in decent fireproof boxes) The offsite is overkill but I would rather be safe then sorry.	St
1.3.1	50G will use less than 15 dvd.	St
1.4.1	I was refering to my backup strategy but for him he should be ok with a hard drive turned off (external enclosure that the drive can be swapped out of) File Hamster is a revisioning system that can access opened files to backup as much as possable	St
