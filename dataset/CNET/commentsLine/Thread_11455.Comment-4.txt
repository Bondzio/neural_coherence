of the system that supports it ?
does the system store only family pics, tax records or is it used for business and earning a living too ?
the question is ... what level of redundancy and backup are you looking for ?
what if the system was hit by voltage spikes, lightning,flood, tornado, etc., ?
raid 5 and having a spare hdd is great but but you may need to think beyond that if you want ensure system availability, data access and continuity of business.
