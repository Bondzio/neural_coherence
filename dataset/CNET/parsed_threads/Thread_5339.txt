<s> I have a HP 3-1 printer conected to my Windows 98 PC via USB. </s>
<s> My wife has a lap top with WiFi. </s>
<s> We currently are using a cable Modem with a Linksys wireless-G router for internet and VoIp. </s>
<s> Can I put a wireless print server on the printer so that we can share the printer and still have it hard wired through to my PC or would I then need a WiFi card for my PC to use the printer. </s>
<s> I'm new at this whole wireless thing. </s>
<s> I understand if I had XP instead of Windows 98 that I could share the pinter that way. </s>
<s> Any advise? </s>
<s> Now I'm wondering if I could use a wired USB print server to my Linksys router. </s>
<s> Would this give me access from both my wired PC and wireless laptop? </s>
<s> you might only be able to share the printing features.. not the other features of the printer... </s>
<s> If you have a laptop that is going through the router then adding/putting the printer on a wireless print server both machines will be able to use it also. </s>
<s> The server you get will have either a USB port or parallel port or possibly both. </s>
<s> Then the hardwire machine does not have to be on if the laptop wanted to print something, Per the setup you stated in the original posting. </s>
