without a cpu, how did you run diagnostics?
that would also say the memory is ok. perhaps its something else that got whacked such as the boot sector or other magnetically recorded media?
probably need a little clearer idea of how you decided the processor is dead.
black screen could be no power at all.
sure it wasn't a blue screen?
you can place the computer on an anti-static surface / pad.
don't place the case on carpet.
you should have ground through the outlet / powerstrip or a surge protector.
if home built perhaps the motherboard is not isolated from the case using the washers that are made for this.
