just a suggestion.... assume you are getting the pent4 2.40 ghz with the 533fsb and 512k cache rather than the pent4 2.40 ghz with the 400fsb and 128k cache.
winxp runs much better & loves at least 256mb of ram especially with the power of the above pent4.
it only cost $49 additional to upgrade to 256mb with dell.
you could get a stick cheaper & install yourself but it may null the warranty..check w/dell.
i come up with $578.
add $29 for 80gb hd and $49 for 256mb ram = $656 also note a floppy drive cost $19 more.
btw the free 17&quot; monitor deal expires 02-18-04.  if you plan on doing some heavy gaming with high tech games to come, then check if that model has a agp slot on the mb to install better graphics.
integrated intel graphics are limited on what games can be played.
