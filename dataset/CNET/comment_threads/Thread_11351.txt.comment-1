My backup pc, which is a Pentium 4, with Windows XP Pro, does not have any sound.
It has an Asrock P4vm800 motherboard.
When I did a scan at crucial.com, it told me that it was an Asus P4v800-x for some reason.
So I am wondering how do I get the sound to work, and can this motherboard with it's current video and XP Pro support dual monitors?
thank you
