1.1.14	Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions .	St
1.2.1	200 watts is much too weak .	St
1.2.2	Even if there is another cause for your problem , the PS needs to be replaced as well .	St
1.2.3	Start with the obvious and replace the power supply .	St
1.2.4	If that does not work , post back with more details .	St
1.3.1	First I agree that 200w is awfully small power supply .	St
1.3.2	I would go with at least 350w .	St
1.3.3	Here is what I do when nothing at all happens when I hit power button .	St
1.3.4	First I unplug from wall and plug something I know works in - checking power line .	St
1.3.5	If that is OK next : Then I replace ( or checkout elsewhere ) the surge protector .	St
1.3.6	They can go bad after a while esp it they have been activated and you did n't even know it .	St
1.3.7	If that is OK Then I unplug everything from the computer except the Monitor and power plug and try .	St
1.3.8	If still nothing I then unplug everything and open the case .	St
1.3.9	I do this wearing a grounding strap on my wrist .	St
1.3.10	Now I check every single cable and internal connection making sure everything is really tight .	St
1.3.11	I use short bursts from a canned air bottle to blow out any dust .	St
1.3.12	I check that drives and cards are not loose and that nothing is dangling onto anything else .	St
1.3.13	I check to see that fans rotate and are n't filled with dust .	St
1.3.14	Put it all back and try again connecting only to power and monitor .	St
1.3.15	If it still wo n't go on then I begin to assume that maybe it has really died .	St
1.3.16	Time to evaluate its age and whether it is worth trying to replace cpu or motherboard , whether stuff is still under any warrenty or maybe time to get new system completely .	St
1.3.17	I wish you success and hope this is helpful .	St
1.4.1	do you think 500 watts is too much ?	Ques
1.5.1	It 's quiet and seems to be just the ticket .	St
1.5.2	Bob PS .	St
1.5.3	I do n't believe for a millisecond it can deliver 680 .	St
