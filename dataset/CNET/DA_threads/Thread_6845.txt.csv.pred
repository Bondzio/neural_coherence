1.1.1	Hello , I previously had DSL with my own combo modem/wireless router .	St
1.1.2	I cancelled DSL and got Cable broadband instead .	St
1.1.3	I 've already unplugged my DSL modem/router and have my cable modem hooked up , all is running well .	St
1.1.4	I bought a new Netgear N600 wireless router that I want to set up .	St
1.1.5	My question is ... .Do I have to uninstall any software or files from my previous DSL modem/router before installing my new cable router ?	Ques
1.2.1	When you change from DSL to cable broadband , you just change the router , there are no software changes on your computer required ( or on the router , your question is not clear ) .	St
1.2.2	Now that you have your computer working directly on your cable modem you just need to record your computer 's MAC address , and set that as the MAC address in your new cable router .	St
1.2.3	Other than that , you should n't have any problems .	St
1.2.4	I 've done this a couple of times , and just walked through the web configuration pages for the new cable router , and it just works ( assuming that you transfer MAC addresses ) .	St
1.2.5	No software to change .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply !	St
1.3.2	I had thought there might be some software because the routers come with an installation disc .	St
1.3.3	I was n't sure if the discs install some sort of program that could cause a conflict if a new or different router was installed .	St
1.3.4	I checked through my program files and could n't find any sort of executable program , though , so I just wanted to double check .	St
1.4.1	Anything accompanying software can help you with is something you can do through your browser .	St
1.4.2	You access the devices web interface via http : \\ ( device IP ) .	St
1.4.3	You really do n't need to bother with MAC addresses either unless using MAC filtering for wireless ... .and that 's not much added security anyway .	St
1.4.4	If you wish , you can uninstall the old stuff DSL stuff ... and I 'd never install my ISP 's custom package if they offer one .	St
1.4.5	Good luck .	Polite
