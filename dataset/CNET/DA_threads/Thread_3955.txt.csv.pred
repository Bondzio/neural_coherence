1.1.1	Yesterday , my little daughter dropped my memory stick and it probably did n't work any longer .	St
1.1.2	It was recognized on my computer .	St
1.1.3	But , every time I tried to open it , it could give me a message and asked me to format it at first .	St
1.1.4	But , when I attempted to format it , the computer would tell me the formatting process could not be finished .	St
1.1.5	Is there any way to retrieve all my files on this memory stick ?	Ques
1.1.6	I still have something important on it .	St
1.1.7	Any idea could be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Do one thing connect the memory stick to other system , if it is visible there then recover your videos from there to some other storage media .	St
1.2.2	If its not visible then you can try a data recovery software to recover your videos .	St
1.3.1	You should never put your memory stick on a place where the little child would access .	St
1.3.2	Right now , in order to get back your data , just disconnect it to your computer .	St
1.3.3	Since it still could be recognized , it may be fixed somehow .	St
1.3.4	Do not save new thing on this drive from now on and try to download drive data recovery freeware to get back your videos , such as TestDisk , EaseUs Data Recovery and iCare Data Recovery Free , etc .	St
1.3.5	After the data recovery process , you would try to format this drive and see whether it could be fixed .	St
1.3.6	Remember : Never try to save everything important on only one drive in the future .	St
