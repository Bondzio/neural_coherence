The 1st one looked like it had a lot of radial marks in it on one side, but the 2nd one was smooth on both sides. The unit kept working after the 1st one came out, so I forgot about it, and now a couple of months later, the 2nd one has come out, but it's still working. I have a 2002 Dell Dimension 4550 PC and the CD/DVD drive is a Memorex 16-X player. Did these objects come from the player or did somebody put them there when I wasn't looking? If they came from the player, is this a minor or major issue to leave them out, and if I need to put them back in, is there a link to a tutorial to guide me thru it?

The cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious CD you may like. Anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news. -OR- you could use it until it really poops out. Its your choice, but again, I would replace it. Also, if you have kids, are they into mischief? If possible post a link with some pics of the items in question. tada -----Willy
