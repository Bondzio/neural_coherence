Even in their prime, Socket A machines could be finicky.
Today, some 6 to 10 years later we refuse Socket A machines at the service desk.
Yes we could make a bundle taking them in for &quot;diagnosis&quot; but that would not be cool.
What you need to do is keep collecting these or just get a Freecycled P3 or P4 that works.
You are not doing anything wrong here.
These are just problematic, failing old machines.
