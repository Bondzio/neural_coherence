<s> A little while back I thought my boot hard drive was bad because it showed bad sectors. </s>
<s> I got a new one to transfer what I could (which was everything) after installing windows vista. </s>
<s> Now I've reformatted the drive and scanned it again and now it says everything is fine. </s>
<s> My question is it fine? </s>
<s> The bad sectors aren't just being hidden are they? </s>
<s> Find a SMART reporting tool for your drive. </s>
<s> (most will do fine.) </s>
<s> And look at the spare count. </s>
<s> Here's links about it -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=smart+hard+drive+reporting Now about your questions. </s>
<s> You are right to ask but without the actual drive and it's smart report before, during and now we can't tell more than if Windows burped and called it bad and a fresh format did wonders or not. </s>
<s> By the way. </s>
<s> The entire industry was under a lot of pressure years ago as consumers would return a drive with a bad sector. </s>
<s> Something had to be done so SMART, sector spares and such all were done almost entirely to get the consumer off the industry's back. </s>
<s> Yes the industry tried to explain how 1 bad sector in a multi gigabyte drive didn't make it a bad drive. </s>
<s> Consumers didn't want that drive! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't save any of that info, but I have scanned it with both Western Digital DLG tools and hdtune and they both say it's fine. </s>
<s> Also which one on the smart data is the spare count? </s>

<s> Current: 200 Worst: 200 Threshold: 140 Status: OK Which is the exact same thing my other two say. </s>
<s> Too bad all the details are not here. </s>
<s> For example that DeathStar drive would have me change my replies. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 It's only 3 months old. </s>
<s> Are there any other details needed? </s>
<s> Also what does &quot;For example that DeathStar drive would have me change my replies.&quot; I don't quite understand what your saying there. </s>
<s> Why would we spend this much time on a new drive. </s>
<s> The IBM Deskstar model has such a high failure rate many renamed it. </s>
<s> In my view this is a simple case of you needing to call it in. </s>
<s> I'll do that. </s>
