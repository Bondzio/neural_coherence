<s> Does any one know if there are any Windows 8 (not RT) tablets out there that will also do Intel Wireless Display (WiDi)? </s>
<s> I see the Acer W700 has a CPU that is WiDi capable, but it will NOT do WiDi. </s>
<s> Greg </s>
<s> I know those that promote or love it will disagree but due to built-in limitations on playing of certain content, which changed a while ago with WiDi 2.1. http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/intel-widi-2-1-adds-hdcp-and-blu-ray-streaming-2011056/ So that left all those early adopters with broke systems. </s>
<s> The result of all this is low sales and low interest over all. </s>
<s> To solve the HD wireless connection I use one of those wireless HDMI solutions. </s>
<s> Good luck on your search. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Thanks for the come back! </s>
<s> Care to point me at &quot;one of those wireless HDMI solutions.&quot; that you use? </s>
<s> All of the reviews I have seen about them do not look so hot. </s>
<s> If I found one that worked well, I would go that way. </s>
<s> Greg </s>
<s> http://sellout.woot.com/offers/philips-wireless-hd-net-connect-8 I picked this up since I could pop that in, power the transmitter with USB. </s>
<s> All the reviews are tainted with folk that, well I apologize, are expecting more than the product can deliver. </s>
<s> That is I see folk read &quot;good for 20 feet&quot; then they stick a wall and hope it will go 40 feet. </s>
<s> That will result in a bad review. </s>
<s> I'm guessing here you want that iPad screen over WiFi solution. </s>
<s> Maybe that's out there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Looks like a few of them have shown up since I last checked into it. </s>
<s> That model is not available just now, but I think I have a few other ones on Amazon. </s>
<s> Not using an iPad, need to use a windows pad for other requirements, so wan it to work with that, and actually only from the couch to the TV..... Greg </s>
<s> At home we have the usual Kindle Fire HD 7. </s>
<s> I was going to use this on that but went with a HDMI cable instead. </s>
<s> I used the usual miniHDMI to HDMI, coupler, then HDMI to HDMI for the last stretch. </s>
<s> Overall it's 31 feet long and works great without much to do and under 20 bucks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Here's what I use. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B006KYY1AU/ref=mw_dp_mpd?pd=1&qid=1360395638&sr=8-8 Samsung series 7 slate I have windows 8 pro on it and the WiDi has some bugs in connecting sometimes, where it doesn't synch right on first connection and I have to disconnect, close the WiDi management program and the. </s>
<s> Restart and reconnect. </s>
<s> Then, if the tablet hits sleep mode the connection and software will need to be reset again as well. </s>
<s> I don't recall those issues when I used Windows 7, however. </s>
<s> And it comes preloaded with Win7 Home Premium. </s>
<s> Otherwise, it is good for my uses, presentations in the office and streaming WatchESPN and movies to the TV at home. </s>
<s> The system has some limitations to note, primarily no built in SiM slot for cellular data hook ups (only a minor inconvenience to me, as I just tether my cell when needed, and WiFi is pretty obiquitious where I travel. </s>
<s> Also, there is no pen slot on the device for the stylus which is just a hassle. </s>
<s> Also, the battery life stated is obviously wrong (7 hours?!?! </s>
<s> I wish). </s>
<s> I end up with about 4.5 - 5 hours of just using word, onenote, email, some web surfing and some other non-intensive windows programs. </s>
<s> I get about 3 for steady video streaming, say from Amazon or Netflix. </s>
<s> Otherwise, it's a solidly built system that comes in at about the same price point as a surface pro tablet with 128 GB SSD, and no WiDi. </s>
<s> I'm happy with it for now. </s>
<s> That's not right. </s>
<s> After decades of bringing products to the market with bugs, why should we keep such today? </s>
<s> Take it back. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I hear you Bob, but my point was that it is a stable and usable system on a Windows 7 machine. </s>
<s> The bugs only occurred when I upgraded the tablet to Windows 8 Pro, and as I recall, the upgrade assistant and the Intel website noted that there were issues using the platform on Windows 8 at the time. </s>
<s> So it was my decision. </s>
<s> I like Windows 8 so I was willing to put up with the buggy WiDi driver in hopes that it gets resolved soon. </s>
<s> Someone who bought the same machine and kept Windows 7 on it, is likely not to have my issues, as I never did when I had solely the Windows 7 Professional installed. </s>
<s> Would think with the 128 GB SSD you coud do a dual boot but I guess with it being an update you would hav to install W7 twice and upgrade just one partition. </s>
<s> Is that possible? </s>
<s> yep that does the trick more fage than fage,,, did you get it to work.. </s>
<s> And yes wireless HDMI does work. </s>
<s> Too many folk use it today and there are too many models that work so it's considered a good solution. </s>
