<s> Hi, I would like to connect two Windows machines (XP and Vista) using a crossover cable and use remote desktop. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> I have only one monitor so I would like to see what is going on in the other machine using remote desktop. </s>
<s> If remote desktop does not work, are there any other options for me? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I was able to test it. </s>
<s> I used statis IP addresses and had to make sure the remote connection setting was enabled on both Vista and XP </s>
