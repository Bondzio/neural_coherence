i read page 39 and i was putting my 2gb ddr3 stick of memory in the correct (channel c) slot.
i did, however, notice that the description of the memory to be inserted into channel c shows &quot;1 gb, 1333mhz.&quot; i am using a 2gb stick as i do not have any 1gb sticks.
so i dont know if that could be a problem.
i also read page 42 and i am also correctly placing my graphics card in the correct (primary pci express x16) slot.
now page 54 could be the main problem.
i used the manual for plugging the power supply connectors into the motherboard.
i saw that there were four slots to be plugged.
i plugged the 24-pin connector into the slot, the 8-pin connector into the slot, and the sata connector into its slot.
i see the fourth slot is an ide connector slot but i could not locate it on the motherboard.
i do see where it would have been on the motherboard but it is simply an outline drawn on the board.
the slot is missing or not there.
as for page 55, i see the prongs of the bios settings but there is no &quot;jumper&quot; figure plugged into the prongs.
