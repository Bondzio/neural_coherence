I have a problem on it where for some reason the ATX power connecter cant be in all the way or the cmoputer will turn on but the motherboard wont recieve any power. Besides the point i was wondering what kind of motherboard i could the most bang for my buck. I hate intel so i would rather go that way then intel just because i hate them and they suck. Also im going to get a new case simply for the fact that its an oem case and they tend to look nice but are very cramped so im going to get a new case too. Also im going to need a new processor with that motherboard. Just wondering what kinda advice someone could maybe give me.

This simply cannot happen as described. If you are saying the PS fan or other fans run but the PC does not boot, that's an entirely different issue and one that might be resolvable. If the PC runs normally when you leave the PS connector only partially inserted, I'd be looking for a deformed pin or jack in the connection. Sometimes the jack (female end) just spreads a bit and causes loss of connection. This is very common with HD power cables when one is constantly connecting and reconnecting them. It's easy to &quot;reform&quot; these bad parts. I use a pin extraction tool that's slightly larger than the female ends to insert and &quot;wiggle&quot; them back into shape...or some thin needle nose pliers will work. It can also be that one of the pins is just loose in the connector and is being pushed out when you insert it. Take a good look and good luck.

Mainly im going to be using the game for some light gaming, internet use, music and video. My budget is yet unknown, and since im only fifteen its a little harder to get the funds but at this point i think 400-500 is what im going to be able to spend. So i really like the suggestion but i think ill go with a 50 dollar cheaper processor.
