i think you will regret buying it.
it would of been a different story a few years ago, but with the current technological advances and higher-end multi-core cpus becoming increasingly cheaper, you might think twice about acquiring a system that is quite inferior to today's standards.
but if you intend to stick with xp or use a linux distribution that utilises low-end hardware, then the pc might get the job done.
but if you want vista, even basic, it will be a constant struggle.
and with the ridiculously low amount of ram, working with multiple apps is going to slow things down a lot.
