He had the Geeksquad come and set it up and I have no idea what they did. A mess of wires. I noticed that I was able to log into the imbeded browser of the modem and the router from the main PC. I didn't think it was possible to log into the modem if it was set up in bridged ethernet mode. His internet is working but I was thinking that he may have problems with double NATing. Basically, I just want to know what options there are for setting up a router to a modem. I'm aware of bridged mode and setting up the router as a switch (not real knowledgable of this one). But before I tell him it's set up all wrong, I want to know if I'm missing something. Seems like DHCP is enabled on both devices. Please advise.

The problem with double nat is mostly related when you need a incoming session into a local PC. If all the traffic outbound then it doesn't matter. Pretty much depends on the IP for the modem and the router are on the same subnet. If they are on different ones then you have a double nat. Running DHCP on both will work well in most cases but again it depends if you need to map ports to a PC. The outside address of the router could technically change so mapping would change. If there is no mapping of ports then it can change all it wants and the user PC does not care. There is nothing wrong with double nat it tends to be confusing for people to get setup and to debug when there are issues. Once it is works it works

I just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations. I've never seen a setup with double NATing before, so I thought something was wrong. He's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router. Should just be a non-wireless print server. I think I may leave that one alone.

Your post is light on specifics such as type of connection, make and model of modem and router, and operating system. So here is the generic setup. First, you don't need to access the modem unless you're just looking around. Second, set both the modem and the router to default. If there is a software switch, use it. If there is a reset button use it. Turn everything off. Now, connect everything thus: modem -&gt; router -&gt; PC Power up the modem, wait for the lights to stabilize. Power on the router, wait for the lights. Power up the PC. On the desktop, right click Network Neighborhood, choose properties and choose to show the Networking icon in the tray. Only to see if traffic is moving.
