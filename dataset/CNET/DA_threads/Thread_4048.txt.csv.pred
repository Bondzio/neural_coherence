1.1.1	I recently bought a new external hard drive ( Seagate ) with a NexStar case .	St
1.1.2	It shows up in & quot ; Device Manager & quot ; but not in & quot ; My Computer & quot ; or & quot ; Disk Management & quot ; which means i ca n't partition it or anything .	St
1.1.3	I 've tried using the installation CD , but that didnt do anythin .	St
1.1.4	I tried a program Discwizard but that kept telling me to reboot over and over .	St
1.1.5	If you could help me , It 'd be greatly appreciated , thanks !	Polite
1.2.1	Im trying to run this on my Windows XP Laptop .	St
1.3.1	... and format with NTFS ( not FAT32 ) .	St
1.4.1	Could you please tell me how to format ?	Ques
1.4.2	A few people have pushed me in that direction but i never knew what to do .	St
1.4.3	Thank you	St
1.5.1	You did state that you could n't see it in Disk Management .	St
1.5.2	Try Disk Management one more time and INITIALIZE it : http : //www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000588.htm If that does n't work , I 'd install the hard drive as a secondary drive in my desktop .	St
1.5.3	Then , try initializing it in Disk Management again .	St
1.5.4	If that fails , try SeaTools from Seagate.com .	St
1.6.1	This is where you need to have RAM..	St
1.6.2	I would hope you have at least 512 MB 's of RAM.. ..	St
1.6.3	When you do your START-UP..do not connect the HDD/ Just start the LAPTOP..let it reach its Desktop/ RUN DSKCLEANUP..and Defragmentor../ .. Now Plug the USB in.. ..	St
1.6.4	If that does n't work..I would check my PIN-assignments.. be sure the HDD is useing CABLE-Select [ CS ] .. which means you need to OPEN the External Enclosure.. and view the rear of the DRIVE for the PIN-assignments.. .. You may want to visit the SEAGATE website ... .. and read some INFO on your Drive .	St
