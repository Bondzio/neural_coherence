1.1.1	Hey guys, here's my question: I had 3GB of 800 MHz RAM running in my computer.	St
1.1.2	I guess I decided that I had some money to waste or something so I upgraded it to 4GB (1x4) of 1066 MHz.	St
1.1.3	I understand that with the limitations of a 32 bit operating system I won't get the full 4GB, but my RAM is downclocked from 1066 to 667.	St
1.1.4	Why?	St
1.1.5	I tried installing them all individually to make sure I didn't have a bad stick, and I even returned them and got a new batch, same deal.	St
1.1.6	Any thoughts?	St
1.2.1	But most machines gain at most 0.5GB RAM.	St
1.2.2	Even with the /3GB switch what benchmarks I ran could not find any benefit.	St
1.3.1	Well I knew about the limitations of the 32 bit OS, but I just can't figure out why it downclocked the speed.	St
1.3.2	At the very least it should be running at 800 if not 1066.	St
1.4.1	There's a reason I get stuff there.	St
1.5.1	Its the motherboard that dictates the speed your ram runs at not the ram.	St
1.5.2	Ram described as 1066 means it is capable of running at that speed in a suitable MB not that it will run at that speed in any MB.	St
1.5.3	There is a free application called cpuz-144 that will tell you what the bus frequency of your MB is, Ram rated speed should be equal to or greater than the bus speed of the MB.	St
1.5.4	HTH	St
