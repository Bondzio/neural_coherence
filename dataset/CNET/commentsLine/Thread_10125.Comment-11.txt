you said: &quot;my cooling issues are in the winter; the heat blows down near where this computer sits; in the summer the a/c blows into the same spot, so it runs quite a bit cooler in the summer than in the winter.
i could never run a pc in the summer without a/c in texas.
when the a/c failed the last time the 2nd floor tempurature reached 118 degrees f. after two days.&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ one of the reasons, i mentioned shielding or moving a system from direct sunlight.
it was surprising that users just didn't understand having a system under direct sunlight couldn't possibility be the cause of added heat to the system.
i understand being next to a window is great for viewing the outside, but there is a price to pay, system wise.
if your system is direct path or your a/c, great a benefit, the flipside is in path of heat vent, not so good.
why not have a movable platform(simple dolly on wheels) and move system to a less direct path.
why, push you're luck.
