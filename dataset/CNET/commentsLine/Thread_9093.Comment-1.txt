i need to add some extra ide discs to my server but already have 3 and a cd drive in it.
if i buy a seperate pci ide controller, will it work alongside the existing one in the motherboard allowing me another 4 drives or will there be a conflict?
i've had a look around various web sites but can't find anything that answers this question.
thanks,
