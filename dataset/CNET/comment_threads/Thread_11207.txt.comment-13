This is a note to say thanks to all of you who read and gave suggestions about how to retrieve data from my flash drive.
Especially to Willy and Bob who came up with the winner.
Zero Assumption software did the trick, restoring all my valuable records and files......I promise never to depend on Flash hardware for storage again.
I recommend this software because it's easy to use and because, unlike the others.....it works.
Tell your friends.
Again....thanks everyone, you made my New Year.
