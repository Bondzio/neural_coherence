hi guys, i come across with very wiered problem...i have a external hard drive with 40gb with two(2) 20gb partitions.
both partitions are showing only 1gb or 3gb free disk space.
but there is only 4.83gb on first and 1gb of data (normal or hidden) on second partition i can see and rest of the data is invisible.
i have tried digital rescue to recover but it didn't help.
can anyone plz help me sort out this problem as i am unable to understand the real cause...... also i remember copying some data which is also invisible..... is there any software which can look for invisible (not deleted) data????
any help or comments will be appreciated... thanks -- sjunejo
