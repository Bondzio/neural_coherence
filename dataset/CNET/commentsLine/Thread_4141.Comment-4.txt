you can find a multitude of adsl2 modem/wireless router combos everywhere at very reasonable pricing - or even used/ good working condition on ebay for less than $20.
you are correct in that they can plug directly into your phone jack - dsl filters are only for phones/ faxes where you do not want a dsl on the line, otherwise as stated - no filter in the jack & you have a instant access to dsl which the modem is plugged into.
word of advice, stay away from 2wire modems if you can - especially if you're looking to get some range out of the device .

they are horrible & setting up or using wpa is a complete nightmare.
i have heard that linksys cause some a bit of a headache also when initially setting them up - but there are very good, reasonably priced modem/router combos by d-link (my favorite, mainly b/c i'm used to the interface), belkin & am currently looking into a few new ones myself by zoom (x6 model, for example), etc.
one other thing to make sure of is the compatibility - 802.11b/g should be fine for all computers/ laptops/ netbooks these days & 802.11n has even faster speeds/ range without much interference (i.e.
portable phones, etc.
), but make sure you're compatible - or at least that they are backward compatible w/ 802.11b/g & you're off to the races
