i was hoping perhaps someone here could help me.
i recently was given a nice 20 inch monitor by a guy who was going to a flatscreen, and didn't have space in his apartment for the older monitor.
he was running it on a mac, with an adapter which had dip switches.
from what i've found out, i think this is so you can run an ibm monitor on a mac (not sure).
the cable ended in rgb and the black sync wire.
after a little digging, i was able to buy a vga cord that had the four outputs.
however, i tried to connect it, and the monitor looks all scrambled.
i checked the inputs, and they're all set.
my computer is a p3-500, running with a voodoo3-3000 card.
there are no distinguishing marks on the monitor to tell me who makes it, or what model # it is.
there's a serial #, 1894470020, with a small dm subscript underneath, on the back.
digital machines?
the controls on the bottom of the monitor are v-stat,h-stat,v-cent, brightness,contrast, power.
i'm hoping to find out what make/model this monitor is, and what the refresh,resolution, and such should be.
there's a utility where i can change the refresh of my video card.
it might only work for windows, but that's all i work in anyway...i can stand it garbling until windows boots.
if i have to, i'll see about getting a gemini card (for fixed frequency monitors), but i'd rather not if i can avoid it.
i've included links to some quick pictures i took of the monitor, as well as the adapter for the mac, in case that'd jog anyone memory.
thanks for your help in advance.
