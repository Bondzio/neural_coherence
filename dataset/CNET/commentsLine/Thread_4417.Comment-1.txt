i'm having the darndest time cooling my cpu.
it seems to idle at abot 55 c. i had the stock fan in there, but replaced it with a copper hsf with silver 5. it started off cooler when i started it up again, but then went back up to 55. it's a amd athlon 3000+ on an epox 8kda series mobo, 1gb ram.
any ideas on what's wrong?
