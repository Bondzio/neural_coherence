(my first build on a budget)	[img] http://i238.photobucket.com/albums/ff156/hikari1980/pc.png [/img] Not a huge gamer or anything so I let my friend pick it for me. I mainly use my pc to make videos so I was wondering if this pc build was good.

For about the same price as the EVGA GT 250, you can pick up a Sapphire Radeon HD5770 card. The graphics will be much better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102864 (and your motherboard supports both ATI and NVidia)
