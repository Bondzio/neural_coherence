Hi and I would really appreciate your help on this I have a notebook connected to the internet through wired lan and I want to share this over the wireless lan to another notebook.
Both notebooks have XP home SP2.
The Host computer has the following: Wired lan (has ICS setting) IP: 10.0.15.
*** Subnet Mask: 255.255.254.0 Gateway: 10.0.15.254 Wireless SSID(***) has been set to ad hoc with automatic IP and dns etc but shows as not connected Client setting Shows as connected to the SSID(***) with IP: 169.254.240.179 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 Gateway: 169.254.240.179 Now I don't know much but I definitely know that I shouldn't have the gateway as same as the clients IP and I'm thinking that the host should show connection... Any idea what I need to do?
