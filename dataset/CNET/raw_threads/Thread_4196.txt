I am considering buying a new MacBook and was wondering...If I install and run the MS Office 2004 for Macs and I save a document, can I carry that document to a PC running its own MS Office and read it there as well? I am asking this question because I have to transfer many of my work from MY computer to my work's (a Windows-XP running PC). Well, thanks for the help!
