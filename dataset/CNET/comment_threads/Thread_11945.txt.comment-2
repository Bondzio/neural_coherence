Here's the bridge I used.
HOWEVER it may tax the occasional networker or users.
The WGPS606 was so cheap and worked so well that at 25 I bought two.
Let me state that to setup as a bridge you CHEAT and LIE that you are setting it up as a print server but bail out when you get to the print setup.
Viola, a bridge.
