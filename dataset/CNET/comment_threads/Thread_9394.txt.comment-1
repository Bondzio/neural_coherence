I currently have 4 SATA drives and 2 IDE drives that I would like to attach to either my router or an extra PC via USB and run them as NAS.
I current have them spread out in two cases both running Server 2003.
Reason I want to abandon the existing setup is A. I don't like running both servers all the time due to power consumption (want to be able to power on and off as I need them) B. one of the servers is beginning to show signs of main board failure.
Here are two products I found for the SATA: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SIL-CA-06-20336-PB or http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=MAP-AI32US-PB&cat=CSE .
Both of these contain two SATA drive enclosures so either will suit my needs.
I cannot seem to find an external drive enclosure for 2 IDE drives.
I have found plenty of single drives such as the following: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=USB20-SATA-SIL&cat=HDD But I am not too keen on this one due to it only supports 1 drive and has no cooling fan.
Please let me know if anyone has had any success or failure with either of these or could recommend a different device.
Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
