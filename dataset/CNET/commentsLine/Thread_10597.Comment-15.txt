the drive uses the reiserfs format.
it's a linux based filesystem and please, under no circumstances, try to use it under a windows environment (as in hooking the drive directly to the ide connector).
windows will attempt the read and after failing ~255 times, for reasons unknown, it does something to the first couple of sectors of the drive that renders it unreadable once you replace the drive in it's housing.
you must use a *nix based system to reformat the drive, and then reinstall the drive.
hope this helps a little.
