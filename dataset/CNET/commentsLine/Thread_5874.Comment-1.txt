hi, i have a desktop pc with a maxtor sata which holds my os etc.
i have an old hard drive with some important video's on that a need to transfer onto my pc.
it's an ide.
i have connected it to the ide cable that currently runs my dvd rom, i have also plugged the power cable in.
here's the problem, it doesn't show up in the bios.
i have tried setting the jumper to primary & slave but still no luck.. still the bios shows the dvdr as primary ide and when i enter secondary ide there's nothing there.
any suggestions?
j
