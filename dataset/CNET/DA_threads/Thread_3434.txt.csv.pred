1.4.1	In the sense asked , or if it does , another solution to pack more data on a disk is to use a Plextor Unit that uses some of the error correction space on the disk for actual writing of data .	St
1.4.2	This might be called & quot ; over burning & quot ; the disk or over burning might be what you need to google to find other solutions .	St
1.4.3	I do n't know if that causes compatibility issues with other players or not .	St
1.4.4	When I looked at this issue , I concluded it was cheaper to buy more media than to spend it on hardware and now I am burning to dvd media which is far cheaper per gigabyte .	St
