<s> My M/B is a ASUS P5LD2-VM, the chipset is Intel 82945G, the cpu is dual core and runs at 26.6 GHZ, and I have 4 Gigs of RAM. </s>
<s> I want to install a 3D Video Card to improve the display. </s>
<s> Presently I'm using the onboard video. </s>
<s> I need a suggestion for buying a compatable video card, that will give me the best performance for the price. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions are welcomed. </s>
<s> I would like to stay under $250. </s>
<s> You need to be a little more precise about the circumstances under which you want to 'improve the display'. </s>
<s> Do you mean for general use, for games, for CAD/CAM, etc., ?? </s>

<s> I realize that to get really serious about games would require much money. </s>
<s> Presently the only thing I'm thinking about is using 3D with Google Earth. </s>
<s> I also have &quot;MS Flight Simulator X&quot; and the &quot;LS99 golf&quot; game. </s>
<s> I just increased my RAM from 1 to 4 gigs, but I haven't noticed much improvement in the performance of the computer. </s>
<s> I suspect that I'm not running anything that requires that much RAM. </s>
<s> My fear is that I'll spend a lot of money on a card that may not be compatabile to my system, or may not be any better than what I now have. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> but believe you can buy a plenty decent PCI-e 16X video card for under $250. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Let us know how it goes....you can check the performance of the various GPUs units there too. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I wasn't going to go into the store and just pick up one, and the advice of the so called tech people in the stores near is horrible. </s>
<s> I installed a GeForce 9400 GT 1 GB DDR2. </s>
<s> It was reletively inexpensive (about $75 w/tax). </s>
<s> On Google Earth ad the Flight Simulator the performace was much better. </s>
<s> I haven't tried the golf game yet, but I'm well pleased. </s>
<s> I was ready to pay much more. </s>
<s> Thanks Agian, Jerry </s>
