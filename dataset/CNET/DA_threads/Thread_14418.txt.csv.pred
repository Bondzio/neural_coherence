1.1.1	We would like to purchase a color/b & w copier for under $ 1000 .	St
1.1.2	Estimating 2500 b & W , 1000 color copies/day .	St
1.1.3	We do n't need alot of whistles just volumn .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions .	St
1.1.5	Also where can I find cost/page info for comparisons ?	Ques
1.2.1	Look to the usual names that lease these monsters .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	While you maybe copying , you 're really printing .	St
1.3.2	Too often the output can easily outstrip the basic makeup of anything in the $ 1000 range .	St
1.3.3	You 're going to be working this to death .	St
1.3.4	Visit any copier/m-f printer and check the lifecycle specs or similar .	St
1.3.5	Further , if you do buy , that you seriously consider a & quot ; service contract & quot ; to be beyond any warranty period .	St
1.3.6	In fact , it maybe better to have double the devices in order not to overwork any one device .	St
1.3.7	Otherwise , expect to replace such in short period to be rid of persistant problems and/or carry & quot ; maintenance kits & quot ; to have on-hand for x-number ( usage ) periods to lessen typical problems .	St
1.3.8	Heaven forbid , you get into & quot ; duplex & quot ; demands .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I do n't know if this combination is possible , but our office is looking for a multifunction printer with duplexing , network scanning and copying but is also somewhat compact , or at least with a small footprint .	St
1.4.2	We were using a Laserjet 4100 that fit well in the area available , but it simply was n't capable of the amount of output we need .	St
1.4.3	For me , price is less of an obstacle than size and reliability are .	St
1.4.4	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.5.1	Once you get into heavy usage , you truly need to spend the money , period .	St
1.5.2	Either you buy or lease something that actually is robust and can handle heavy output .	St
1.5.3	Otherwise , expect to replace the new printer because you exceeded its std .	St
1.5.4	output and on a constant basis , lets not fool ourselves .	St
1.5.5	If you get beyond typical usage , you got ta have the stuff that can take it .	St
1.5.6	I found HP , Minotla ( sp ) , and Okidata printers robust overall , but again find a match you need .	St
1.5.7	If copying is more in demand , then Xerox and its offering are still up choice .	St
1.5.8	Good officesupliers/vendors or similar will consel you on your needs and try to make a match .	St
1.5.9	Your duplexing needs will on its own cause grief .	St
1.5.10	Too often once you reverse the paper path to complish duplexing , it gets involved .	St
1.5.11	In other words it a mechanical nightmare , so again having a robust printer/copier helps alot .	St
1.5.12	As for size , it becomes too big an issue , then relocate if possible , generally speaking , the bigger it is or the more you want out of it , tends to be larger units .	St
1.5.13	However , newer models are smaller for just that reason to fit customer needs .	St
1.5.14	I can only say further , if you find something that does everything you want but its big , live with it ( if possible ) ; ) .	St
1.5.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St

1.6.2	They 're decent quality and reasonable on price .	St
1.6.3	My late husband had one that was quite good .	St

1.7.1	HP specs lay out how many pages per month of use is designed for all there printers .	St
1.7.2	I personally like HP above all others for Small Office use .	St
1.7.3	See link ( if it works ) http : //www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/can.do ? storeName=storefronts & landing=printers & category=all_in_ones & orderflow=1 & a1=Type & v1=LaserJet & catLevel=2 # bcAnchor Regards , Sherwood	St
