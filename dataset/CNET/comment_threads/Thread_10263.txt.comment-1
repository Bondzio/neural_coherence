Hi there, I have tried to install my CX3200 on my vista laptop with the drivers CD that came with the printer - but it didn't work.
Now i have read on the Epson website &quot;DO NOT USE THE CD THAT CAME WITH YOUR PRINTER!&quot; But they don't explain what to do if you HAVE done this!
Anyone know how I can remove the old drivers and install the correct ones?
Thanks in advance Martin
