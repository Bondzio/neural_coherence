I put together a computer with a Asus P5LDe-Deluxe board, everything is great. all connections cool -execpt for one problem-. bought a new 320G Western digital (SATA 2) drive and had an existing Western Digital 250G (SATA 1) drive. I formatted the new SATA 2 drive s boot drive- the old SATA 1 drive was already formated. though they both show up in BIOS i cant see the SATA 1(old drive) in -My Computer-. tried disk manager utility in windows and the W.D Data Lifeguard program- thought with SATA all drives where compatable. i mean SATA 1 and SATA 2, do i have to step down the SATA 2 drive to SATA 1 spec. with jumper? cant figure it out. should be no need for slave or master on SATA, right? Hope someone can point me in right direction. thanks for the help.

203	2	213732	2285644	2285120	nubot	10/21/06 1:23 PM	1.16143698E12	hope this helps you more to understand my problem.	more infomation: i had one drive, my original drive(SATA 1), bought second drive(SATA 2)used on ASUS P5LD2 mother board. can a SATA 1 drive work with a SATA 2 drive? both show up as bootable but the SATA 2 drive, is the primary. i want to be able to log into old drive to copy files or use seperately. i can format it as storage drive- but lose all info- i want to copy it's files first. was thinking maybe i can use windows disk to repair the partion (or fix windows) maybe that might allow it to show in -MY COMPUTER -in windows and allow me to use it. the SATA 1 drive shows up on everything- but MY COMPUTER in windows- and in disk management there is no drive letter. in SATA config. on the board, i have the 320g(SATA2)as the primary drive- plug 1 (the RED one) and the original drive the SATA 1 drive is on the slave SATA plug 3 (the BLACK one)- this is designation on the Asus motherboard SATA plug 1+2 master and SATA plug 3+4 slave. hope this will help you more. thanks.

But your issues appear to be related to nothing in your first post. No mention that the drive was used in some other system so I wouldn't note that this is often how people learn about backing up what they can't lose. Look up ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and I wish you luck, Bob

203	8	213732	2287324	2287056	nubot	10/22/06 2:58 PM	1.16152908E12	it worked!	thanks alot man- you the man. you really help me. cant figure out how i got the drive to be reconized. my first Motherboard (before this new one that i used old drive in)stopped working. and i found two viruses on old drive, but only after it was reconized. do you think the windows cd had something to do with it, when i reinstalled the drivers( but it was already showing in bios, and disk manager- just not in My Computer?, and no hardware issues in device manager? any way this is what i knew could happen with these drives, and we worked it out. so thanks again for the info BOB- the last bit totally helped. i'ld like to know what you think allowed the drive to be reconized, or was it a quirky thing. thanks
203	9	213732	2287330	2287324	nubot	10/22/06 3:15 PM	1.1615301E12	one more thing	sorry forgot to ask this, will try it. but i should have no problems no doing a simply drag and drop from one drive to the next to transfer files- this could however spead a virus right.
