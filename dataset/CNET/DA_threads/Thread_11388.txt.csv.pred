1.1.7	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	Take a look at the stuff available at Macsales.com .	St
1.2.2	They do a good range of external ( Firewire ) DVD burners that are guaranteed to work with your Mac and the iLife suite .	St
1.2.3	Just plug it into the Firewire port and you are set to go .	St
1.2.4	A copy of Roxio Toast is always a good idea too .	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	They offer ready to use solutions ( ie .	St
1.3.2	works with Mac ) and it 's not too pricey compared to not long ago .	St
1.3.3	Have you tried a CD/DVD lens cleaner .	St
1.3.4	I get about 1/2 the trouble units to come back after that .	St
1.3.5	But repeat customers ( those that it saved ) usually on the 3rd or 4th tries the drive has truly expired and we replace it .	St
1.3.6	If this was my machine I 'd consider getting a new internal drive since it 's all too convenient plus I do n't want to suffer having to reload/repair the OS from a balky drive .	St

1.4.1	Thanks much for the info .	St
1.4.2	Niv	St
