<s> Hi - i have tried to set this router up on my Grandad's laptop. </s>
<s> I did not get an installation CD with the router so i set it all up on line. </s>
<s> All that seemed to work fine and when i go to the &quot;see available wireless network connections in range&quot;, on my laptop it does show up, however i can not connect to it wirelessly. </s>
<s> What am i doing wrong.....it has driven me potty - my grandparents have now gone away for a short break but i would love to have the solution ready to fix this when they return. </s>
<s> They currently connect to the internet via virgin NTL - from what i can see i plugged all the cables in correctly to get it up and going however as soon as i unplug the blue lead belonging to the netgear wireless router from my computer the internet connection goes and i still can not connect wirelessly!! </s>
<s> Any help would be hugely appreciated L </s>

<s> The reason you can't connect is that DSL can use PPPoE software to login. </s>
<s> When you change to your router you don't need that since you'll set the router to handle the login. </s>
<s> There was some clamor to ship the routers with the radio set to off. </s>
<s> Did you turn it on and set it up like we note at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 Bob </s>
