i am using the sound card you mentioned, and all other components look like you are right where you need to be.
dual layer disk are expensive at the moment, but maybe they will come down some.
the only question i ask is whether you really need that much video card.
now days, most $180 cards will keep up just fine.
of course, if you really do serious gaming, and have the money, more is better.
consider this , though.
most cards are outdated in 6-8 months (although they still work fine) and the expensive ones keep getting cheaper.
i prefer to buy the slightly older (not cheaper) ones, and just upgrade every year or two.
the money you save could be enough to go to 1 gig of ddr, and that will give you speed, and a nice cushion when working with photos, movies, ect.
buy the best (fastest) memory you can afford, it pays in the long run if you really want that little extra speed.
the memory speed will make the video, and gaming slighly faster.
i am refering to the cas-2 memory clock settings in bios.
you can't configure it in bios if your memory don't support it.
check the specs of the mainboard you are buying to be sure it supports the faster memory, but i feel that it probably should.
