<s> I have 3 PC and one cable line. </s>
<s> They are sharing the internet through a router and 2 wireless cards. </s>
<s> I am thinking of getting a new Mac Will this create a nightmare?? </s>
<s> Will the new Blue tooth technology in the Mac recognise router?? </s>
<s> OR can I connect the router to the mac and have the other 2 PC connect to it thru the wireless card?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if ur gonna have one mac then let the pc have control of all the router settings and ect. </s>
<s> ur mac should have built in wireless so theoretically you should be able to connect to ur router. </s>
<s> and the other pc can use the wireless card. </s>

<s> I can open them to add memory, hard drives, and various cards, But I know nothing about Mac's But, I guess when Apples says &quot;Right out of the box&quot; it could be so. </s>
<s> I just thought it was too good to be true. </s>
