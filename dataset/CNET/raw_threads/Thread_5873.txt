Much to my dismay I learned that my new laptop did not come equipped with a PC Card Slot, instead it is loaded with an Express Card Slot. I am wondering if there is a PC Card reader that I can hook up to my laptop either through the Express Card slot or via a USB Port. I really appreciate the help!

I recently bought a Dell XPS laptop and went to my nearest Best Buy today for the great deal they've got running for the Verizon PC5740. In calling Verizon twice in the last 2 weeks to ask about the service, plus stopped into 2 seperate stores, no one mentioned an issue like this existed, even though I'd told them the model computer I'd bought. Every Verizon store and authorized retailer is happy to sell you the card, but no one said there might be a compatability issue. According to Dell, all of the PC Card makers are updating their cards this June...which means, if we're lucky, they'll be available for Christmas!! I'm really ticked off that no one mentioned this problem ahead of time. How could this have gone on so long without the word getting out??

But there are no known EVDO EXPRESS cards so it's time to call and ask for the laptop to be exchanged for one with a PC-Card slot. They get this all the time. Bob

So my new dell 1505 laptop can't use my 108 mbps wireless notebook adapter and is slower then my 5 year old laptop. What a scam, Dell should have told me when I bought it.

I found 2 locations that still sell the adapter, but it was to the tune of $198.00! Just a little too much for the convienence. So I wait with anticipation for Verizon the launch their service's ExpressCard...

After a lot of complaining on the phone with the Cingular customer service person, I was connected with a Cingular tech person. He told me that they were starting to get complaints about the lack of compatability (new laptops don't have both types of slots to accomodate this transition.)He was very nice and helpful. My next call was to HP to explain my situation and they told me the express card slot was the &quot;next generation&quot; of slots for laptops. Great, but in the meantime I must wait for the card slot makers to develop a new sized card to accomodate express sized slots? Cingular uses a PC card manufactured by &quot;Novatel&quot; located in San Diego. Novatel provided the following informative update; &quot;Novatel Wireless is at an advanced stage in the development of ExpressCards which should be on the market in 2006H2.&quot; &quot;In addition to getting regulatory approval, each of the service providers must approve the new cards on their networks. Please contact your service provider(s) to find out when they are going to approve and sell the new cards.&quot; &quot;Your question to the service providers will help them to understand the demand and help them prioritize their approval process of the ExpressCards.&quot; Excellent advise! In the meantime, I am stuck in a technology time warp with a new laptop but no wireless connectivity! Personally, (in my case) the information provided to the consumer on the label and packaging by HP should CLEARLY state &quot;Not compatible with Type II PC Cards.&quot;

In the beginning of May I wanted to buy a new laptop using Verizon's broadband service. I decided on a Dell laptop. I called Verizon and specifically asked if their card is OK in the Dell laptop, and the sales rep assured me it was OK. And here it's 2 months after Verizon knew about the Express Card problem, and the Verizon sales rep STILL gave me the wrong information that their card would fit into my Dell. So much for Verizon customer service...

You're right, that's easy to get and use. The problem is with the card used to connect without ANY wires to anything. The PCMCIA card. Here's the best example I can come up with: I'm not looking for a cordless telephone for my house, I'm looking for a cell phone so I can make and receive calls anywhere. Anyone else out there have a better way to explain this more easily?

Dell has finally put an express card up for sale which is Verizon supported however you can only get it directly from Dell. Verizon has yet to start selling them. So you have to buy them from Dell http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4357 then once you get it you have to call up Verizon and have them activate service for it.

I hold in my hands the Training Guide issued to Verizon Wireless employees for the new V640 Wireless ExpressCard with assurances from a sales rep that the cards are shipping this week. The guide includes a compatibility list, so everyone should be able to determine if their laptops will work with the card. The associate did not know what the pricepoint will be, or if VerizonWireless will be offering any rebates with the initial release, but at least he had some knowledge of the troubles we've been lamenting about! That's more than I (and based on the responses to this forum, everyone else) have gotten from Verizon in the past!! Hopefully, there's light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not an oncoming train!!!

It seems that the local wireless vendor shops (all providers) tend to specialize in only cell phone knowledge, sales and equipment. It would be nice to have a single point of contact 800 number (or?) as often the local wireless shops have limited knowledge regarding the laptop wireless connection options.

It is a newer technology for 32 bit cards. http://www.mp3car.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=214 It appears that most newer broadband cards are supported. For the Sprint PC-5740 (the same card used also for Verizon), I am told it will work, but you will need to use a manual install for it. Basically, the connection software provided by Verizon does not see the card so they assume the same for Sprints, but there are directions for manually enabling its use with this adapter here: http://www.elandigitalsystems.com/support/ufaq/newconnection.php I hope this helps some folks. This has been very frustrating for us as well to have new laptops now without being able to use our existing Broadband modem cards.

I too have a Dell Inspiron and recently ordered a broadband wireless card though Sprint, as my they are the provider for my mobile service. I was really excited about the possibility of being connected at home (we live in the country and there is no way I'm going back to dial-up). You would think that the online Sprint store would disclose compatibility issues, but noooo! How hard would it be to post that their cards don't fit Express Card slots? I'm so disgusted with not only Sprint, but Dell as well - why did they do this? Dell has an Express Card Modem for $179 but it only works with Verizon. Cingular compatibility is due out at the end of the year. What's up with Sprint?

It worked like a charm. The problem was she decided she needed a lighter computer and bought a Dell Latitude 420 notebook (refurbished). She bought this particular computer because it has a PC slot and she assumed that she could use the Verizon card in the slot. The card doesn't work. Verizon says it isn't their problem because the card works in the other machine. Dell says it has to be a problem with the card because when a WiFi card is inserted, the computer provides it with power. Neither side will budge and she is left with a computer that doesn't serve her initial purpose. The Dell web pages say the slot in the D420 will work with a Type I or Type II PC card. Any suggestions other than to return the computer? She has a two-year contract for the Verizon card that just started in August.

I run thru laptops like they are consumables...I have to have at least 4 running all the time for my business and 1 that I take on the road. As they break, I get another one to replace it. Up til now, I haven't had a problem using my wireless access card while traveling...until I bought my last two computers (both from Dell). They too only accept the Express Cards and I already paid $300 for the AirCard and it still works fine! I don't want to buy another card but can't find any laptops that will still accept my card. I am sure there must be some type of adapter out there (???) but haven't been able to figure this out. Maybe I am asking or looking for the wrong thing. Can someone help me? I use my Sierra Wireless Air Card by Verizon to &quot;dial-up&quot; to a cellphone signal and get reasonably fast internet connection when I am traveling and there are no wifi access points available. I have my service for this thru Earthlink at a hefty $90 per month for unlimited usage but hear that Verizon offers it for less. But do you then have to purchase the new card? This is sooooo confusing. Bottom line - I need to find a low cost laptop that still has a CDMA card slot. I would like to change my existing service over to a lower cost carrier. The CDMA card says Verizon but the service is thru Earthlink. If I am unable to locate a PC with this compatible slot, is there an adapter available that will allow me plug into an express slot and use this existing card? Thanks!

I just bought a new HP laptop, not realizing that it only had an express card slot. Then I bought a new Verizon Wireless Sierra Aircard 595 PC card (the only Vista compatible card according to the Verizon sales rep) which doesn't fit into the express card slot. So far the only possible solutions I've found are Quatech's USB adapter for 32 bit cardbus wireless modem cards for $179(which costs more than the PC card) from Sewell Direct or Elan's USB adapter for $189. Both of these support Sierra Aircards although the specific model I bought isn't listed. Duel Systems is &quot;testing&quot; the DuelAdapter which looks like a USB reader but fits into an express card slot. It's not listed as being Vista compatible, only Windows XP and Mac OS X. The PCIMCIA website (www.expresscard.org) suggests getting the Verizon V640 EV-DO ExpressCard but according to Verizon's website (and the Verizon sales rep I spoke to) the V640 doesn't support Vista. If anyone has any other solutions I'd appreciate the info.

Here is what they have to offer and they said there is an adapter to change your pcmcia to express at best buy and I will give you the update if I find what we need.This is getting very costly after buying a $2000 computer. s http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4813

The new EX720 express card from Sprint (only $59.99 a month regardless of your cell provider) is the way to go. It can be had for $129.99 here: http://moremobileinternet.com/ex720 which is $50 less than from Sprint direct. This devise works on All laptops with the Express slot...XP, Vista and even Macs.

I went ahead and ordered through Dell.com and ordered this for $220.00: http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4813 I went to Cingular and they added the Laptop Connect feature to my existing Cingular service for 59.99 a month. It's been smooth sailing ever since, it's just a shame I had to come out the pocket $200+.

After reading some of the threads on this discussion I priced EVDO routers and they were just as expensive as the adapters. I didn't want to shell out more money after having just bought a brand new computer. Verizon did eventually make their Express Card V640 compatible with Vista and they were nice about exchanging my air card.

I checked around, some phone companies have USB phone card that are easily transfered to any other computers. But, Cingular is coming with a Express phone card in a couple of weeks. You can already get info at cingular.com, go to business stuff and search for &quot;express card&quot;. It seems that cingular is putting G3 everywhere, which is fast, very fast connection...

It is $109. Says it is compatible with most DELLS and network cards from your wireless provider. I think it is ridiculous that NO ONE mentioned this to me either. I was so mad when I found out my new laptop was useless!! Dell TECH SUPPORT (on top of being rude and not having a grasp on the English language)told me to put my PCMCIA card back in the clear plastic &quot;jacket&quot; that it came in and then it would fit in the slot for my DELL INSPIRON 1521 LAPTOP WITH EXPRESS CARD SLOT!! I could not believe that they were trying to convince me of such a ridiculous thing. Obviously TECH SUPPORT doesn't even have any CLUE about the changes in their products!! DELL SUCKS!!! I HOPE THIS HELPS SINCE NO ONE ELSE WILL HELP IN THE &quot;SUPPORT&quot; DEPARTMENTS. PS: BEST BUY, CIRCUIT CITY, & RADIOSHACK DO NOT HAVE THESE ADAPTERS. SEWELL.COM HAD ONE AS WELL. PEACE & GOOD LUCK!

Based on what I read here, the DuelAdapter looked like the solution. But when I called Duel Systems' tech support to make sure about compatability, &quot;David&quot; told me they HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN THE DUELADAPTER TO WORK WITH ANY HP PAVILLION 6000 SERIES LAPTOP. Looks like I may have to purchase a new Express Card from Verizon and simply trash my 6-month-old AirCard595.
