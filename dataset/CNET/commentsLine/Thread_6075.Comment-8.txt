when you power the machine on do you get any beeps?
normally one hears a single beep and the pc moves on showing the bios and then loading windows.
if you get a series of beeps these will tell you what is wrong.
normally it is eight beeps to indicate faulty graphics card.
but doing a search on beep codes for you motherbaord would confirm errors relating to number of beeps.
now, if you ain't getting any beeps or anything then one would tend to look at duff motherboard or powersupply.
hope this helps.
