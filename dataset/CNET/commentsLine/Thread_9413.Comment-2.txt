marc from new egg supported cpu: socket a amd athlon/athlon xp/duron processors.
this is your m/b.
from new egg model: amd athlon xp 2400+ core: thoroughbred.
this is your cpu.
not supported by m/b.
key word core.
m/b supports athlon/athlon xp/duron core.
as intel and amd improves function on the existing cpu, its core, they give it a new model name.
pins may be the same but not the internal working parts.
did this help or just muddle things up?
