<s> Would love to find a laser printer that works with refilled cartridges (trying to be green) or at least has cartridges with such high yield that you don't mind paying for them every once in a while. </s>
<s> It's a small office, we probably print less than 50 sheets a day and do not require color printing. </s>
<s> We are switching to laser due to running through our print cartridges so quickly with the inkjet and being fed up with printers NOT working with refilled or refurbished cartridges. </s>
<s> If you have a suggestion for or against any laser, we would appreciate it! </s>
<s> There are a lot of Laser printers out there, for a basic reasonably inexpensive one, look at Brother I saw one on sale, I believe at Office Depot for around 70.00 a couple of weeks ago. </s>
<s> As I said there are many manufacturers out there, it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint. </s>
<s> The best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications, cost per page etc. </s>
<s> Best of luck! </s>

<s> Having wireless technology will work very well in an office setting. </s>
<s> I have never used a stock HP cartridge with this one, except the very first one that came with the printer. </s>
<s> HP wants 70 bucks for them, and I'm getting them on amazon now for 11 bucks including shipping. </s>
<s> Our family has always had good luck with HPs. </s>
<s> Another thing to keep in mind is that (at least when I was shopping for a laser) you might want to see if the drum is a separate accessory, and if so, how many pages you can expect to print off of one, before replacing it. </s>
<s> When I was shopping, HP said that the drums are built into each cartridge so you don't have to worry about this, but they can be quite expensive for other printers. </s>
<s> Maybe they are all like this now (built into the toner cartridge), but when I was buying this, a Brother that I was thinking of had it as an extra part that would need to be replaced. </s>
<s> Practically all laser ptrs. </s>
<s> out there have refillable toner carts available. </s>
<s> The more popular, the more likely easily available. </s>
<s> There are also, services that maybe local to you that provide the actual refill service or carts when needed. </s>
<s> From what I've seen Brother and Samsung have the bottom end of mono-lasers out there. </s>
<s> They're good and you need to review the specs. </s>
<s> Many are under $100 and deals can be had. </s>
<s> At those prices, you can buy another printer and leave it on the shelf until dire need. </s>
<s> Replacement toner carts, while new from OEM are cheaper now, refills still are cheaper, but as always, cheap is cheap. </s>
<s> Buy, from a source you deem worthy. </s>
<s> Also, HP has low cost mono-laser but here you need to review what options start to fall into place, like wifi, memory, paper handling, duplex, etc., to include other brands as well. </s>
<s> A low-end printer should last at least 2yrs. </s>
<s> before some issue crops up and that also depends on usage. </s>
<s> As a small SOHO, don't settle for price alone. </s>
<s> I have recommended Konica, HP and Canon while more expensive tend to simply last under normal use. </s>
<s> taeda -----Willy </s>
<s> Be careful with refilled toner cartridges. </s>
<s> I used to spend my days charging a lot more than a cartridge costs to tell people &quot;The problem is the toner cartridge&quot;; or worse yet cleaning up the mess when a &quot;rebuilt&quot; cartridge dumped its toner in the machine. </s>
<s> Canon, basic, smallest model appears to be the best for home use. </s>
<s> It has many features not found in others. </s>
<s> I am using it for about 2 years now, without any trouble. </s>
<s> I am delighted to use it. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Hi, when you are checking out the specs as others have suggested, be sure to check the Duty Cycle, usually expressed in pages per month - it's a pretty good indication of the workload a printer can handle. </s>
<s> that said, most lasers will have no problem with your 1000 pages per month (50x20). </s>
<s> I've had a Samsung ML-1750 for about six years now and the quality of the print is still as good as the day I bought it. </s>
<s> It happily runs on Cartridge World refilled toner cartridges ut then they do refill genuine Samsung cartridges, not compatibles. </s>
<s> The only niggle with Samsung is that the initial cartridge supplied with the printer is half load - a tad mean! </s>
<s> HP Laserjet 10xx models have a pretty good reputation too and should be fine for the print capacity you need. </s>
<s> I've no experience with Brother but their price is very attractive. </s>
<s> Depending on your needs, you might want to take a look at some of the laser all-in-ones that have now reached the &quot;affordable&quot; level. </s>
<s> can also result in a blue face if the refill invalidates the warranty. </s>
<s> I HAVE A BROTHER 5370DW ITS A WORK HORSE, FAST PRINTING, PRINT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PAPER, WIFI. </s>
<s> THEY SELL AROUND $170 TO $200. </s>
