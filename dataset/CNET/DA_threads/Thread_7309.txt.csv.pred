1.1.1	Please help I have installed a new motherboard in my destop, i purchased the same model(ms 6763 ver 1.0) but for some reason the driver for the ethernet controller hasnt installed.	St
1.1.2	The motherboard didnt come with a driver disk.	St
1.1.3	I would like to know how or where i can obtain said driver.	Ques
1.1.4	I have tried a number of sites online via a diffferent pc (as mine at present wont go online as i cannot connect it to hub) but these sites want to install driver/hardware identifier software and as it is a different computer i want to install said driver this solution is no good to me.	St
1.1.5	Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance	Polite
1.2.1	And yes, I'll be using google to find this.	St
1.2.2	And yes, we always install the motherboard chipset driver or else we may install the correct ethernet driver and it will fail causing us to think we got the wrong one.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Is this an MSI board?	St
1.3.2	If so, about all I find is this.	St
1.3.3	http://us.msi.com/service/Live-Update-5-Manual/ Unfortunately, you would need to be connected to get the driver.	St
1.3.4	Their site is quite lacking but I wonder if you could find a way to borrow a NIC and get a driver that works.	St
1.3.5	You could use their live update software to find drivers you need.	St
1.3.6	I wouldn't be surprised if motherboard drivers weren't needed in order to proceed to get other drivers.	St
1.3.7	In any event, you need to be on line and perhaps some friends borrowed NIC could do that.	St
1.3.8	Good luck.	St
