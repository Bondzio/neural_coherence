<s> good day people!i need your help...i need some info about AMD Sempron and what are its strengths and weaknesses...thank you very much!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Old socket that is at the end of its life. </s>
<s> No 64-bit support, what more could i say. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Low cost entry 32-bit mass market offering? </s>
<s> To add to what other posters mentioned, let me say in layman's term, &quot;the VW of cpus&quot; It gets you from A to Z, w/o fancy overhead but don't expect a geewhiz factor, it just gets the job done on the cheap. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> CPUs on the low cost. </s>
<s> Basicaly Semprons are the older 32 bit socket A Athlons with a new lable. </s>
<s> There are versions that are socket 754 and offer higher front end buss speeds but are still 32 bit. </s>
<s> The 3100+ is $112 at newegg. </s>
<s> But for $124 at newegg you could get the AMD64 2800+. </s>
<s> Two years ago I built a PC with a AMD Athlon 2400+. </s>
<s> A few months ago I did another one for a friend who wanted to keep the cost low, used a Sempron 2400+. </s>
<s> The only difference between the two is the cost of the processor. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> The socket A version is really a renamed athlon xp with a 333MHZ front side bus and 400 points added to its model number. </s>
<s> The Socket 754 version is and Athlon 64 with lower cache and no 64-bit extensions. </s>
<s> However, AMD IS MAKING 64-bit semprons and should be coming out around July 30, according to xbitlabs.com </s>
