can i use syncback for back-uping or syncing a whole network drive.
it consist of files like exec, doc, gint, and sort of images...?
how to do it ^_^ so i think i need to install it on the server by doing a remote desktop and put the syncback there, then i connect the external hard drive (wd my book essential 3.0) also on the server...?
am i doing the right thing..?
thank you so much
