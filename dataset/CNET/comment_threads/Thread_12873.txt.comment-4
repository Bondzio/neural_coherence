It is a 330 watt max power supply, so I guess Im ok, but, I still havent figured out the problem with my graphics.
In games such as Half-Life 2 and Battlefield 2, I start the game just fine, play on a server, and then when the server chanegs levels, the graphice become all torn-up, and some of the textures are missing, like, lets say there is a couch in the game.
In some cases, a piece of the couch is totaly gone, and even when I shoot the missing part of the couch, there is a bullet mark on that part of the couch.
Sometimes, the texture will be black, and sometimes is it has lines through it and it flashes.
in Batlefield 2, there will be parts of the sky, ground, and sometimes a part of the aircraft that has missing, black, or flickering textures, but only after the server chanegs maps, or if I switch to the menu or cntrl+alt+delete.
very anoying and im yet to find a fix.
