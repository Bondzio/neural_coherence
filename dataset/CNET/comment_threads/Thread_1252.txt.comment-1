I have to buy a new computer and wanted to know which one of these would work best for gaming.
Acer AX3-100-EF10 Desktop Computer (AMD A10 5700 / 1TB / 12GB RAM / Windows 8 ASUS CM1435-CA002S Desktop Computer (AMD A8-5500 / 1TB HDD / 4GB RAM / Windows 8 HP Pavilion p6-2429 Desktop Computer (AMD A6-5400K / 1TB / 6GB RAM / Windows 8) I know none of these computers are gaming computers.
I just want to know which would be the best at it.
Also, is the best of those 3 better than this one for gaming?
HP Pavilion p6122f
