hi, i have a hp 5200c scanner attached to my ancient dell xpsr400 puter.
i am a dufus when it comes to upgrades and i bought an ocr software program named omnipage 10 a while back, but due to other issues only installed it to the computer and not to the scanner.
i try to use the program to increase the scanner's capabilities, but it doesn't seem to help.
what am i missing here?
how do i get better results with the omnipage software if it is possible?
any words would be a help!
