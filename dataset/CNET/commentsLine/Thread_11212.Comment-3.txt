i dont quite understand you, wireless router 192.168.1.1 is now dhcp enabled, rest of them are dhcp disabled.
basic problem is that i san not acess 192.168.1.130 from ap#2 computers, and 192.168.1.131 from ap#1 computers.
not even with ping.
both aps are tp-link tl-wr543g with latest firmware, one set in router mode, another in client mode, connected properly, dhcp disabled on both.
