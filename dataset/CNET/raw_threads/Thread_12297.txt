None of my USB ports seem to work, when I plug something in the error message titled &quot;USB Device Not Recognized&quot; pops up and the device does not operate. I have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and I have tried these methods. - Unpluging power cord and battery - Deleting the items for USB under Device Manager - Checking for updates in windows update - Scanning for hardware changes in Device Manager I would really appreciate some help. I have Service Pack 3.

This dv8000 has an onerous install procedure too similar to this -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 This is why I use the restore media as folk rarely will pay for the 2 to 5 days to install XP.

Also use the inbuilt hw diagnostic for any information in regards to this.

Check your system, using the Control Panel, Device Manager and look for the USB tab. If it has a question mark of 'x' beside it, you need to install the machines drivers, so that the computer itself can recognize the ports. Download the required driver from the manufacturers website and install them, or (after downloading), Update the drivers from the control panel, using the download. Should work perfectly after that MarkinTO

FAT 32 is a universal standard which allows external devices like HD's, thumb drives, and memory cards to be used interchangeably to transport data back and forth etc. So perhaps you have some devices specifically formatted for the Mac, or perhaps some other system. So you might check your formatting.
