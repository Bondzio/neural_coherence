i was given an older gateway laptop with an orinoco wireless lan card built in.
i have updated the driver so that i could use wpa.
i have a belkin router g and a desktop and an ipod connected.
i get great connection speeds with my other devices through my dsl connection, however, the gateway laptop is getting less than dial up speed (17k) i am sure it is some kind of setting/tweak.
please provide me with any advice.
thanks.
