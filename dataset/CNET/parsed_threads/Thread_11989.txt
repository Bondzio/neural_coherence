<s> Hi, I recently became the manager for a small office, which already has a wireless network set up for internet, but not for file sharing. </s>
<s> I have tried setting up a network using &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; and &quot;Wireless Network Setup Wizard&quot;, and tried adding a network place, but after all of them, I still don't see any of the files I set to share, or the network name. </s>
<s> I have been able to ping the computers on the network, so they're in range, but I still can't share anything. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for setting this up? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Firewalls and user accounts (lack thereof) are the usuals. </s>
<s> To save me from typing it again I'll not duplicate any answer that was given from the linked discussion you'll see next. </s>
