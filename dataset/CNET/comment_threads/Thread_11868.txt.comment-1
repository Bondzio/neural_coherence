I recently installed Network Magic on my PC and on another in a home network.
Since the install, about 6 GBs of space has mysteriously disappeared from my hard drive.
I have installed no other programs.
I've already looked at the obvious culprits, such as fragmented files, clearing out the various caches, defragging, etc., and I'm stumped.
Network Magic is a very small program (less than 50 MBs), so I'm not sure whether its installation and the disk space disappearance are purely coincidental, or whether there's truly a correlation.
Does anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?
