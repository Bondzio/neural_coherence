i have always build my own machines, (well... since about 1996 when i first started!).
although i do appreciate that computer system manufacturers build machines suitable for most everyday users, that will work for most purposes and programs, i do think that if you are looking for a computer that can work well for customized/specific uses/programs, then a custom computer works best.
you can change what you want within the pc without having problems for example; invalidating the warremty on your machine, or problems locating drivers that can be accepted by the manufacturer of the machine.
also as the subject states above, if you know or have an idea what you put into your built machine, you usually know what you'll get out and/or what you'll have to do to upgrade it.
