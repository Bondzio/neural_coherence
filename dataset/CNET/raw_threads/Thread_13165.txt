The last time that I tried to access it it said that something about it being a security device and I popped it out. Everysine then I have not been able to acess the data on the flash drive. It is a 8GB drie and nearly full. It has all of my most precious data on it icluding baby photo's, the book i have been writing and tax information. I am thinking that somehow it was converted to a security device but I have searched high and low on how to change that as well with no luck whatsoever. I am quite desperate. I have not backed it up because of time. So please don't give me any smart remarks about being stupid for not backing it up....i know that i was a fool for not backing it up. Sony Vaio Netbook Windows 7 Starter 32 bit Intel(R) Atom (TM) CPUN450 @1.66 GHx 1.6Ghz 1.00 GB memory Thanks for any help that can come my way.

I also experienced a sudden &quot;USB Drive not recognized&quot; on my Lenovo ThinkPad laptop with Win XP on a Philips 4Gb pen drive that had been working flawlessly for a year or two, losing access to the 3.75 Gb of data stored on it :-(( Tried on one other PC with same result. Any suggestions for a possible recovery?

Sorry but it's a shame to post and reply rather than you do a little research or try the free titles anyway. A shame because we could be discussing if Linux boot CDs found it or not. Lose a turn? Bob

For this to apply your USB stick or drive works fine in other machines. That is, all machines but yours.&quot; I had stated that I have already tried my unrecognised USB stick on one another machines with no luck. As regards: &quot;A shame because we could be discussing if Linux boot CDs found it or not.&quot; I tried the UBUNTU bootable CD without luck, either: no sign of any USB devices there, unless I should have looked in some mysterious location that I missed. Drink something mild to soothe your bruised nerves. Cheers. Sandro.
