Now that it is just beyond its one year warranty period, it has the modem has started to make a strange noise. It sounds sort of like a machine gun, and lasts about 5 to 10 seconds at a time. I have not noticed that there is any action that I take on the computer that trigers this. It seems to happen at random times, and it may happen once or twice within 2 hours of computer use. I have not noticed any change in the good performance of my computer. Any ideas? Should I do something about this?

Here it is. -&gt; Something has moved inside to occasionally brush with a fan. To fix I open it up and inspect the areas around any fan. I might move/push cables to be a little farther back from a fan. Bob
