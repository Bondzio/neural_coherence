<s> Hey guys, I'm on a bit of a budget so here are my options: Pentium 4 Processor 650 with HT Technology (3.40GHz, 800 FSB) with 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz -or- Pentium D Processor 830 with Dual Core Technology (3.0GHz, 800FSB) with 2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz -or- Pentium D Processor 840 with Dual Core Technology (3.20GHz, 800FSB) with 1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz Which would you recommend? </s>
<s> Option 1 (the P4 w/2GB RAM), Option 2 (PD 3.0 w/2GB RAM) or Option 3 (PD 3.2 w/1GB RAM)? </s>
<s> Also, is it worth $50 to upgrade the RAM from 533MHz to 667MHz and why? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> What is it that PC needs to do well? </s>
<s> What is it this PC needs to do only acceptably? </s>
<s> Answering thes questions will help you narrow your options. </s>
<s> You've only mentioned 3 choices by brand/configuration so you must have ruled out any others already. </s>
<s> Two of your configurations have 2 gigs of RAM. </s>
<s> Most uses won't need anywhere near this amount at this time...maybe some games or high end graphics applications. </s>
<s> If that's imperative, your choices are narrowed to 2. </s>
<s> As for being on a budget, there's one thing I learned not to do and that's to buy lower end with the idea I could easily upgrade in the future. </s>
<s> In the technology world, the future is no more than a few weeks away and waiting too long makes upgrading less attactive than replacing. </s>
<s> Buy all you can afford now for what you want to do now and in the near term....just my personal thoughts and advice...listen to others as well. </s>
<s> Good luck making your decision. </s>
<s> The machine will primarily be used for gaming. </s>
<s> Perhaps some productivity (Excel) spreadsheets but nothing too advanced. </s>
<s> I'd like to be able to actually play some of the newer games with the detail turned up, well, as high as possible. </s>
<s> I haven't upgraded my home machine in probably 3 years (been funnelling the money into laptops) and as a result haven't been able to play anything new except on the lowest detail/graphics settings possible. </s>
<s> Hopefully that helps narrow it down. </s>
<s> Any of these will scream compared to your 3 year old system. </s>
<s> The additional 1 gig of RAM won't add much in performance in most uses but the 840 is going to be hard to justify cost wise. </s>
<s> You might have noticed that CPUs go up logarithmically with speed rather than in linear fashion so the trick is to find a sweet spot. </s>
<s> If you're wanting to play games, an important item is going to be your video card. </s>
<s> You're savings by going with the single core HT CPU might give you enough extra to put into a decent graphics card. </s>
<s> Personally, I have no interest in gaming so would prefer to defer to others in this regard. </s>
<s> But, you mentioned being on a budget so it sounds as if comprimise is also an option. </s>
<s> My gut, however, says the 840 will offer little more than bragging rights at this time and single core with a decent video card might suit you and your budget quite nicely. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions Steve. </s>
<s> Do you have an opinion on spending $50 to upgrade the RAM from 533MHz to 667MHz? </s>
<s> Will I notice that at all or should I keep my $50? </s>
<s> I would go with the Pentium D 830 with 2 GB DDR2-667, if possible. </s>
<s> The increase in memory speed might not be that worth it. </s>
<s> But if the price difference is low, then go for it. </s>
<s> RAM will operate at the speed of what clocks it. </s>
<s> The clock is the governor. </s>
<s> You can put a faster motor in your Subaru but, if it has a governor, you get no more speed. </s>
<s> If you remove the governor to get more speed from the engine, your tires and suspension will need attention to take advantage of the more powerful engine as well. </s>
<s> RAM that can operate at a faster speed might assist if you intend to overclock but will add nothing if you don't. </s>
<s> If you plan to overclock, RAM is only one of several performance items to look at. </s>
<s> One thing you might do if performance is important is look at the HD you buy. </s>
<s> These are always a bottleneck compared to other components. </s>
<s> Such drives as the WD Raptor are about as good as it gets without going SCSI. </s>
<s> These tend to be smaller in size but will hold the OS and lots of applications. </s>
<s> You might consider one of these. </s>
<s> Couple it with a solid SATA drive of larger size to be used for storage might be a good thought. </s>
