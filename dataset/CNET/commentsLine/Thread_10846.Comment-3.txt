two possible fixes.
find an adapter that matches your needs(the cheap fix) or buy a new video card.
if video card, you need to disable the on-board video, install new card with required ports and s/w to finish install.
being a media center system may complicate things, imho.
of course you can google away for others that may have fixed a similar issue.
believe me, this hd tv stuff is getting popular but attaching to old systems can be a no go w/o added attention or expense.
