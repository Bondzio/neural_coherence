you know, i've never use norton ghost, but for certain i could tell you how i resolved such problem.
when i bought new pc at first i wanted to keep my old hdd (as it has much needed data), but it was only 40gb.
so i after long searches i found clone disk software .
it's the easiest and most convenient backup program.
i just create an exact image of my hdd and make a bootable cd (due to highest level compression it takes not much space).
and recover cloned hdd onto new pc automatically.
if you'll use the same way, you needn't reinstall windows and you'll automatically create pretty full backup of whole your system!
only after restoring you'll have to download upgrades for new pc configuration.
