hello everybody, i'm planning to buy an imac g5 in a couple of months and i've been reading some feedback on the product from other users.
i like the elegant desing of the imac g5 but i'm worried about a possible fried system because of the tiny all in one integrated design.
that concern comes to mind after reading some users said that the system has not lasted more than 30 days before frying.
my concern is greater since i don't live in the u.s. and a refund or system change is more difficult overseas and the investment is too much to take such a risk.
i read that consumers should not buy first generation apple products because they always fail.
is this true?
should i wait a little more?
i haven't heard from apple explaining possible issues about the heating factor on the new imac g5.
many users have complain that it has a noisy fan and its performance is not like the one advertised by apple in the first place.
i like the space saving design and upgrading capabilities of the imac g5 and i would like to buy one.
what do you guys recomend me about the possible heating and fry factor?
thanks
