It is running windoze XP. 1GB ram. 3GHZ pentium If I use my Windows XP install disk and try to reinstall XP it goes into the same reboot mode. If I run a Windows XP LIVE CD the system works fine. I can do anything I want and examine everything errorfree. Another system has same problem except it is a windows 2000 system and it also works fine with Windows XP live. At first I was thinking hardware and changed out the RAM, Video Card, CPU, and anything that could be swaped out. The LIVE CD will run the same with old hardware and new hardware on both systems. Windows recovery will do nothing on either system (as usual).
