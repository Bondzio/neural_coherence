1.1.1	I recently built a new computer , however it seems to be unstable due to an issue with the power supply or grounding ?	Ques
1.1.2	The system has powered down on three occasions .	St
1.1.3	In one scenario I detached the USB-cable from one of the four USB-ports in the back .	St
1.1.4	In the other two , I slightly moved the computer while it was laying on the carpet .	St
1.1.5	Not only did it power down - it would not boot again .	St
1.1.6	The only way I could make it boot was to detach the PCI-cards , the PCI-E Graphics card and even the CPU .	St
1.1.7	After resetting the BIOS , and mounting the cards , I was able to get it up and running again .	St
1.1.8	At this time my system runs ok , however I am worried to detach or attach any cable as long as the system runs .	St
1.1.9	I never had a problem with this on my other self-built systems .	St
1.1.10	I am very curios as to what cause this problem !	St
1.1.11	Any response would be much appreciated .	Polite

1.2.1	Some find that they have shorts develop from case to motherboard from an extra mounting post to other reasons .	St
1.2.2	Your post sounds as if this was your first home made machine .	St
1.2.3	Check your work .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	With all due respect , Sir .	St
1.3.2	It does n't matter if it & quot ; sounds & quot ; like it is the first machine I 've built .	St
1.3.3	It is not .	Res
1.3.4	I am just trying to put the point across that I DID build my own machines before and that I never experienced this problem before .	St
1.3.5	On the other hand , though , I am certainly not a professional .	St
1.4.1	First timers or not , this issue is repeated too often so I toss that out first .	St
1.4.2	I was not there to watch you build the machine so I have to offer the most common issue .	St
1.4.3	Also try using those fiber insulators on the mounting posts just to make sure .	Sug
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thankyou very much for your fast reply , Sir !	St
1.5.2	I never used fiber insulators on the mounting posts before , but I am certainly willing to give it a go - sounds like a good idea .	St
1.5.3	Btw - when working on my problem , I could hear the sound of a loose screw when tilting the cabinet .	St
1.5.4	Could the loose scew be the cause of my problems ?	Ques
1.6.1	Never let a screw loose in a PC .	Sug
1.6.2	It 's metal and could cause a very unhappy event .	St
1.6.3	Power off .	St
1.6.4	Tilt it this way and that until you find it and get it out of there .	St
1.6.5	- & gt ; Over a decade ago I ran the repair department at a computer store .	St
1.6.6	You just hit on one of the quality checks we did on every device .	St
1.6.7	We would check for this sound on machines arriving and leaving ... Bob	St
