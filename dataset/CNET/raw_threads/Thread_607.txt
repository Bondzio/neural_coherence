Of course all of my current computers have USB ports. Is there an adaptor I can buy to use the old zip drive with my new computers? Or ANY WAY at all to get info from those 100 zip disks onto something else?

Your mention of a DB25 connector sounds like the external type that plugged into the printer port and had a pass through to the printer. If that's the case, it would still plug into a printer port if your MB has one. The first internals, if I recall correctly, came with a SCSI card and cable. Later ones were ATAPI. Which do you have?

Except for my monitor which is DB9. All of my ports are for USB, including my printers. I need an adaptor that will convert the multi pin on the ext Zip plug to a USB plug for my cpu.
