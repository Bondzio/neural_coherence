Hi all I facing an irritating problem for the last few days....
I m using my office network, the printer is installed on a desktop, all my colleagues can acces it, but when I try I can't.
I can even ping the computer but can not access the shared resources on it.... a message appears when i try to access the IP &quot; No network provider can accept the given path&quot; I m unable to access even my own PC and the above mentioned message appears.
My firewall is off.
