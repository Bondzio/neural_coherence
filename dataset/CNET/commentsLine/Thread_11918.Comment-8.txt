it seems like your system is jsut sorta on the fritz you have a few options but what i'd do right off the bat is reformat with a clean install of windows do not connect to the internet yet upon reformatting re-install nav 2004 goto the store, and buy a copy of maximumpc that includes a cd with at least firefox (your doing this to get the cd, you can keep the mag if you want (their usually pretty decent) but firefox is what you want, along with spybot s&d) still do not connect to the web install spybot s&d and firefox (firefox is a web broswer, if you don't wanna pay $9 for a maximumpc, connect to the web after installing nav 2k4, and then go straight to  and dl firefox, and then get spybot s&d) firefox keeps spwyare and adware out, and automatically blocks pop-ups it's just such a great web broswer using ie 6 npf 2003 on my system would give me pop up block alerts, intrusion stuff, and various other things all the time with firefox, i get firefox telling me it's doing something, and npf2003 (and prevx...which is annoying to say the least, invision npf's intrusion detection, combined with spybot's registry protection thing, btw i have spybot and npf!
so i get 3 alerts at about anything that affects windows...but hey, it keeps the system clean) firefox just makes the web better
