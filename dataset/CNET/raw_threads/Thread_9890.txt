Current specs on the PC I built about 4 years ago: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 EVGA 132-CK-NF78 Motherboard 4G DDR2 Ram Nvidia GTX560 Video Card What I am thinking of getting: Intel Core i5-2500K BX80623I52500 ASUS P8Z77-V LX Intel 7 Series Motherboard 16G Corsair CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B Vengeance Desktop Memory Kit Questions: 1. Can I use the same case, drives, and power supply I did with my old one? 2. Is this upgrade worth it? 3. Suggestions for other cost effective upgrades? Thanks in advance - Paul

You can check the power connections to see if it can be re-used but I worry about old power supplies. They are not ageless. 2. iffy. The i5 is a dual core with 4 threads, the older Core 2 Quad is a quad core with 4 threads so not a major uptick like a move to the usual i7. Then again it's all about the apps. My i5 laptop and my old Core 2 Quad are fairly equal in transcoding video. 3. Think about what you are using the machine for. If it's a current 64 bit OS, 8GB RAM may hold off an upgrade for another year. Bob

Re using older components...that depends too. Certainly the case and the drives as secondary of maybe for backup. PSU...depends on the old PSU and the new GPU. Might be usable to start with replacement in 12 months...it really depends on the PSU and past use. VAPCMD
