maybe a more generic question.
do you mean with the desktop machine slows down when the laptop is connected and either doing nothing or transferring data not to the internet... ie a local network drive or something.
if you are transfer data to the internet then for obvious reasons it will always slow you down and it will be worse the less bandwidth you have and satellite is very slow to even be called broadband.
now there are routers that can do qos and favor one machine over the other.
at the moment i am too lazy to look them up.
generally if it talks about quality of service or class of service it will do this.
i know there are so called gaming routers that have this feature.
if you laptop is not accessing the internet then you need to follow bobs line of thought and determine what is configured wrong, most any router should be able to handle 2 machines with little issue.
