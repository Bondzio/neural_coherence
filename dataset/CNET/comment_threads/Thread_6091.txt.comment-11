I have tried and tried to get my netgear updated....I have two options.....auto update....I tried that and got a dialog box stating no new updates.....and manual by downloading.....that didn't work either This is a test for my patience I am sure..... Now that the holidays are over I am spending time on my occupation.....funniest thing....about having to make money...... Again I appreciate your responses....I just am going to have to box this up and use the old b band Dlink router until I can save up and buy another brand of router to replace the Netgear products.
Needless to say I am not impressed by either HP or Netgear.....They won't be at the top of my list on replacement of anything..
I finally got to a unhappy customer representative.
His response was I should have bought a business HP laptop....What a jerk......
I am suprised at the way these people want to spend my money..... Really takes the cake.
If I find anything else out I will let you know....
