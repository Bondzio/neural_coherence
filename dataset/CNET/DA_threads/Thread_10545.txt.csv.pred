1.1.1	Hi all, I have an old Cel.	St
1.1.2	333 pc, LX motherboard with 96MB SDRAM,OS : Win98, The mother board did not have any USB ports but there were pins on the board, next to which USB was written, I tried connecting a standard cable with 2 ports to this but no results( I tried checking with a multimeter for any voltage across the pins but could not detect any, was this method correct ?)	St
1.1.3	I even tried installing a PCI card with USB outlets, EVEN this did not work, I&quot;am at my wits's end on what 2 do Any help would be most welcome.	St
1.2.1	http://www.usbman.com and see if there are any BIOS updates to your board and if there is any USB enable in your BIOS screens.	St
1.2.2	LX boards were not widely tested on USB.	St
