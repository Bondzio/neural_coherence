hi, i have a computer with 4x2gb of 1333mhz ddr3 ram (this is the model:  ).
and i am replacing the ram in it with 3x4gb of 1333mhz of ddr3 ram (this exact product:  ).
i just want to double check that this will work alright and that i'm not doing anything stupid some how.
and also i want to know what will happen if i keep one of my 2gb sticks in with my other three 4gb sticks.
will that create a problem?
or will it hinder my computer's performance at all?
thanks very much
