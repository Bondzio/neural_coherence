<s> I have a Dell Dimension 2350 desktop with windows XP operating system. </s>
<s> Just lately when I shut the machine down completely at night I get &quot;Program not responding&quot;. </s>
<s> That seems to only happen at night afer the unit has been on all day. </s>
<s> If I shut everything down after its only been on for a few hours it works just fine. </s>
<s> Sound familiar...and what should I do?? </s>
<s> Many thanks Mil </s>
<s> Mil, Does it show you which program isn't responding? </s>
<s> If you press Ctrl/Alt/Del keys at the same time it should bring up the Task Manager which may show you which program isn't responding. </s>
<s> Tufenuf </s>
<s> When the machine won't shut down, the &quot;notice&quot; I get regarding &quot;program not responding&quot; reads &quot;Card Reader lookup Window&quot;. </s>
<s> Mean anything to anyone????? </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>

<s> This was my first PC..a P4 1.8GHz..256 MBs RAM..Home Edition Sp1.. a FAT32 System Drive..30-GBs..McAFEE Security..it was a nice PC.. .. </s>
<s> I pulled the HDD first/added a MAXTOR 120-GB DiamondMAX[NTFS]File System..added a second RAM Chip for 512MBs of RAM..and the Microsoft CD came out for SP2..so my Home Edition was raised to SP2..how-ever..I also added the XP-Professional Upgrade CD(SP2)..and this is where I began to develop &quot;complications&quot;.. .. </s>
<s> So..for a DELL Dimension 2350 I would suggest the latest SP2 XP Full Version Operating System..no Upgrades or SP2 CDs.. Then 512 MBs of RAM..that Motherboard runs really slow RAM(133MHz)if my memory serves me..that's a problem in these times with HUGE Updateing Services..My Updates have DOUBLED in 6-years.. .. </s>
<s> So your running all day with a Shut-Down Problem.. </s>
<s> I suggest you slow down on Shutting Down.. First..getting to the DeskTop..Signing Off the Internet.. Use the DISK CLEAN UP Program..but wait about 30-seconds before CLicking the ICON(shortcut)..let it RUN..get back to the DeskTop..Click the START-Menu..Click...TURN-OFF Computer..now wait until the DeskTOP darkens before Clicking TURN-OFF COMPUTER..and that should work..otherwise/yes some Device is still running..because of your Hardware Acceleration..the PC can't handle the needs of the programs and hardware..its time to drop some things.. Like a Digital Sound Card(return)to your Integrated Sound Card.. </s>
<s> Remove Video Software..your PC is obsolete for VIDEO..and even DVD-ROM..if you had upgraded to DVD-ROM..you might want to put the CR-ROM and CDRW back in the machine.. .. </s>
<s> This was a solution to some of my problems.. My DELL Dimension 2350 was upgraded to a newer Motherboard and Processor and faster RAM.. </s>
<s> But I purchased a DELL 1100-series DE051..that had numorious problems because of Hardware Acceleration-due to the DVD Drives..and VIDEO applications..also DELL delivered a machine with the wrong RAM Module..once that was replaced/I pulled the Drives and used the old Dimension CD Drives and used the DE051 DVD Drives in the Upgraded 2350..in the DE051 I dropped the Hardware Acceleration-one notch..viola'..one spectacular Internet PC.. .. </s>
<s> If your DELL Dimension 2350 is all original..I can almost assure you its obsolete..but would suggest you just slow down on Shut-Downs..let your DESKTOP---darken..and then CLICK---Turn OFF. </s>
<s> I tried to do as suggested but I got the same result. </s>
<s> It seems to be that way after the computer is on for a lebgthy period of time. </s>
<s> Does that make sense??? </s>

<s> I have been having problems with my printer of late..COULD the &quot;card reader&quot; aspect of which I speak have anything to do with the printer problems ( Brother MFC 4420C)??? </s>

<s> Hi all New to this site. </s>
<s> I am having a problem when I am shutting down. </s>
<s> I run win xp, ECS 939pin mb, AMD Athlon 64x2 3800+, 1 Gig mem, I get the following (card reader lookup window) I have to end process before I can shutdown. </s>
<s> Also the comp just came back from repair; I notified them they were no help. </s>
<s> As I did have an EVGA mb 939pin that was better than the one they replaced it with, that went bad after only 10 months. </s>
<s> I am not satisfied with the work they did. </s>
<s> I got the unit back, they said they tested it, the hd power cable was off & the hd's were switched. </s>
<s> How could they have tested it? </s>
<s> Sorry just venting. </s>
<s> Any help would be great. </s>
<s> Than you MIke. </s>
<s> &quot;I get the following (card reader lookup window) I have to end process before I can shutdown&quot; Many discover that program is not required to read the cards in the reader so they stop using that and the problem is fixed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Other forums indicate that this may be due to a memory card in your printer or memory stick in your computer. </s>
<s> If you click on Safely Remove Hardware before exiting (& select said memory card/stick), it'll go away. </s>
<s> I suspect that whether or not the memory card/stick is in place when you turn on the computer has a bearing on this. </s>
<s> I'm amused by this because I thought it was something to do with the Card Reader software (very old DOS program) which I continued to use until very recently as I had a load of contact details which only it could read. </s>
<s> I haven't used it for 3 months so I was amazed to keep getting this message - anyway, I think I understand now. </s>
<s> It's just another example of Micosoft's incompetence. </s>
<s> I have a brother printer as well. </s>
<s> I suspect that you model has the memory card readers built in. </s>
<s> If I remove a memory card prior to shut down then MS will hang up at shut down. </s>
<s> It wants to save the files even though they are no longer open. </s>
<s> I don't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or USB models for SD cards, just when I use the slots in the Brother Printer. </s>
<s> Given that you probably would catch on to that error, I would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software. </s>
