<s> Hey guys. </s>
<s> I just got an HP Pavilion a1010n pc bundle. </s>
<s> It has an 340 Intel Celeron D Processor (2.93Ghz), 512 PC2700 DDR SDRAM Memory. </s>
<s> 160GB 7200RPM Ultra DMA hard driveand DVD+-RW / CD-RW. </s>
<s> My &quot;know it all&quot; brother in law fried the processor I had bought from Ebay because he did not do what Ray had suggested to do and what I told him he had to do. </s>
<s> And I got so mad that I just decided to get a new pc/laptop for now. </s>
<s> So since I couldn't see the laptop I wanted before buying it (they didn't have it in the store, only online, and the other one wasn't put out on display), I went for the pc at Best Buy. </s>
<s> I'm still going to fix my old pc and maybe sell it or just keep it as a back up. </s>
<s> (any other suggestions?) </s>
<s> After the rebates, I'll be paying only $540 plus tax. </s>
<s> I think it's a good deal compared to what my old Presario ended up costing 4 years ago. </s>
<s> But I will like your opinion, like always, cause you guys are the experts! </s>
<s> Have a great day! </s>

<s> We have a few 2.0 GHz Celerons that do just fine for just about all use except &quot;games&quot;. </s>
<s> Some of the older games are fine, but the newer games seem to be a little strained or just do not perform. </s>
<s> That model is a bargain and isn't a slug compared to machines just a few years ago. </s>
<s> Even 256M is passable for everyday use. </s>
<s> As long as you don't want to play the latest games, you should be fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I really don't buy games to play on the pc. </s>
<s> I only play ocassionally the ones online. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input! </s>
<s> During the day when I'm not home for more than 4 hours, is it ok for it to leave it on Standby Mode or should I just shut off my pc? </s>
<s> Always curious about that... YLC </s>
<s> There's a long discussion about that and I'll lock this dicussion if need be to prevent forum bloat. </s>
<s> &quot;For 500+ Opinions On The Subject.. ...see the link below for lots of information about whether to turn off or not...: CNET Computer Off or On Link http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=19769&messageID=211343 I turn all our computers off at night, if nothing more than to save power and dust accumulation. </s>
<s> The rest is up to you. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> emachines t6212 would be 64 including tax and it would last longer with a pci-express and athlon 64. </s>
<s> I know that eMachines are cheaper, but that's because they are crap. </s>
<s> I will never buy an eMachine, I've heard too many bad experiences from people who've owned them. </s>
<s> I love my pc and I'm glad I got a great deal! </s>
<s> Thanks anyways. </s>
<s> But I guess I turning it off will be better. </s>
<s> The only &quot;good&quot; reason mentioned there is that if you leave it on you don't have to wait for it to start up... that's just lazyness and mine's fast so... </s>
<s> I'll turn it off Thanks. </s>
<s> I am not a power user. </s>
<s> Any powerful conmputers that I build are for someone else. </s>
<s> One of mine is a 1996 PII 333. </s>
<s> I have tried to defrag it twice in that time and never noticed one IOTA of difference, so I don't do all the good things that everyone say that just must be done. </s>
<s> I never run any test programs to time things or any such things, so my opinion re that type of thing is useless. </s>
<s> I do read up on the latest technology, and read the stuff the overclockers talk about, but that's it. </s>
<s> Built a socket 939 system for a Granddaughter in Oregon, sixth grade, &quot;designed&quot; a computer game and wanted to learn how to write programs for games. </s>
<s> For power users at this time the AMD socket 939's seem to be the way to go, but not for the things that you use your computer for. </s>
<s> The one that you bought sounds perfect and the price is amazing. </s>
<s> I can't build one for close that price if I use [buy] legal Microsoft software. </s>
<s> I have helped a neighbor that had a new HP. </s>
<s> I was totally impressed with the amount of data they provide about each model on their website. </s>
<s> Some of it if fairly technical, and thus a little tough to understand for a normal user. </s>
<s> But it is there. </s>
<s> Main thing, Robert may have mentioned it. </s>
<s> I don't think that they supply the Recovery/restore CD any more, but you can buy it, or they tell you how to create one by burning a copy of their &quot;hidden&quot; partition [which is the recovery software] to a CD. </s>
<s> Just to be safe, make two, mark them well and never lose them. </s>
<s> I hope that you simply enjoy the heck out of the new system. </s>
<s> You might enjoy rebuilding your old system. </s>
<s> If you own a digital camera, you could send me a photo of the CPU mounting assembly, to see what it might take to make it secure. </s>
<s> I am enjoying my new pc, it's so fast! </s>
<s> I did call Best Buy because I didn't see a Windows XP with my new pc, and they told me I could create a Recovery cd like you said, or buy one from HP. </s>
<s> I am still planning on putting the CPU in my old Presario as soon as my brother in law pays for the one he fried. </s>
<s> I'll keep in touch. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
