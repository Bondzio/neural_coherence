I forgot to mention you may want to look for a better PSU.
The wattage you have may not be capable or a weak leg of the power is stressed.
Also, since you mentioned replaced heatsinks, be 100% sure the cpu(HSF) is properly attached and rated for your cpu.
That a small amt.
of thermo goop is all you need, excess actually hurts here.
Also, beware of using thermo goop where the manufacturer has already placed a thermo pad, remove pad and use goop.
Otherwise, idf properly installed the thermo pad will suffice.
