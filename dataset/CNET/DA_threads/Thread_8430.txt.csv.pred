1.1.1	I have XP both on my desktop and laptop .	St
1.1.2	Both computers came with preinstalled nt adapters .	St
1.1.3	I bought a compatible wire/wireless router .	St
1.1.4	I did manage to get it setup in the wired configuration .	St
1.1.5	Now , I would like to use my laptop in another room , upstairs..obviously , ethernet connection is out of the question .	St
1.1.6	Question 1 : Can i get a usb wireless adapter for the laptop and be able to get into the internet while the desktop is off or disconnected ?	Ques
1.1.7	Just how does that work ?	Ques
1.1.8	Does my usb adapter catch a beam or something from my router downstairs ?	Ques
1.1.9	Also an aquaintance of mine said that I do not need to buy another adapter , I will be able to use the one that is in the laptop preinstalled .	St

1.2.1	There is a lot of other information that we would need to be helpful and really answer your question .	St
1.2.2	But a generalized answer would be : If you have a wireless router ( what brand/model do you have ?	Ques
1.2.3	) , you should be able to set it up to use with your laptop .	St
1.2.4	Many laptops do come with wireless cards built in , but you would have to provide more information about what kind of laptop you have .	St
1.2.5	And if it does not , then using an external USB card should work fine .	St
1.2.6	If you are using a wireless router , do you have high speed internet of some kind ( DSL , cable , etc ) ?	Ques
1.2.7	If you have high speed of some kind , you should be able to configure your machines/router to use the link independently of the other ( no need to have one machine on all the time to access the internet . )	St
1.2.8	If you are using dial up of some kind and internet connection sharing then you would have to keep the machine with the modem on to use the internet .	St
1.2.9	How well the wireless will work all depends on the variables .	St
1.2.10	How strong a signal your router puts out , how sensitive your wireless card is , how far away you are from your router , how thick the walls or floors in your case are , and any outside interference .	St
1.2.11	If you provide more information about your setup you may be able to get more feedback .	St
