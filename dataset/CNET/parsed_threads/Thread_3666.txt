<s> Hi I have 3 2.5&quot; usb hard drive enclosures filled with Hitachi 120GB hard drives. </s>
<s> I have a lot of trouble with them, they corrupt, cause the computer to blue screen etc. </s>
<s> Hitachi diagnostics don't work inside the enclosures and they suggest connecting them to the computer but the normal cables don't fit on the hard drive. </s>
<s> How do i test these drives? </s>
<s> Is the instability with usb drives normal? </s>
<s> I always properly disconnect them by safely removing them by the icon in the task bar. </s>
<s> Thanks Michael </s>
<s> If you're talking about 2.5in. </s>
<s> as in laptop HDs, use a laptop adapter. </s>
<s> This will convert, once out of the USB enclosure and attach to HD then to a int. </s>
<s> IDE cable of a system. </s>
<s> Most 2.5in. </s>
<s> are jumpered as HD1(master), thus make sure its the only HD present or jumpered as HD2 or slave if used with a system and another HD. </s>
<s> Adapters are found online so google for one, but here's a quick source: http://www.geeks.com You can then run your tests. </s>
<s> I suspects, the HD just got too hot if they not cooled in thier enclosure, though most are vented. </s>
<s> Try using some enclosures with a fan for direct cooling to see if that helps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You didn't tell enough about the setup. </s>
