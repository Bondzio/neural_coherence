hello again, thank you for the post.
here is my current scenarion: file xxx needs to be transferred to another site.
in one day there can be like 10k files (assume) which can be transferred.
in this case i do not want to overload the network with md5sum for each file.
what i found was to check if the file-copy operation was not complete.
for e.g.
if for any reasons file xxx could not be copied to its destination, then an alert can be instantly generated.
is there any solution to check if a file could not be copied then?
