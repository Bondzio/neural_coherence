<s> I've had to reinstall Windows 98 on an older machine and now find that my HP 6200c scanner won't work although it was perfect before. </s>
<s> Each time I try to start the Precision Pro software, there's a message that the scanner cannot be found or that it cannot be initalized. </s>
<s> However, everything seems fine when I check the properties in the Control Panel. </s>
<s> On the HP site there is information about installing 3 specific files to the registry, which I've done. </s>
<s> Since the problem persists, I tried their second solution, which is to use regedit version 4.0 or above. </s>
<s> Since my machine has an earlier version, following their advice I copied regedit 5.0 from another computer. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it won't run--indicates that a certain dll is missing. </s>
<s> Since I don't want to fool around with the registry blindly, I'm stumped. </s>
<s> HP used to have very helpful forums, but I see they are no longer there. </s>
<s> Does anyone here have a suggestion? </s>
<s> I'd be very grateful for any help. </s>

<s> Is that Windows 98 was not installed fully. </s>
<s> The motherboard drivers and what else are usually unknown to most people and ... never installed by Microsoft. </s>
<s> As it stands, your post is incomplete and the reason you reinstalled the OS is missing and more. </s>
<s> Best of luck figuring this out with such a limited posting. </s>

<s> Bob, What more would you need to know? </s>
<s> What else might I need to install? </s>
<s> Do you really want to know why I reinstalled Windows 98? </s>
<s> It's a long story... </s>
<s> Suddenly, all my Office programs stopped working. </s>
<s> Other programs, too. </s>
<s> Nothing would open properly. </s>
<s> After several days futzing around with things, checking websites, tweaking, sending messages, etc. </s>
<s> I decided to repair the registry. </s>
<s> Since that didn't help, I restored the registry. </s>
<s> Now things got really, really bad. </s>
<s> So I gave up and called Dell. </s>
<s> They led me through the reinstall. </s>
<s> In any case, because everything old is gone (or on my backup drive) I wonder why it's important to describe why I reinstalled Windows. </s>
<s> I downloaded the Scanjet drivers and software from the HP site and assumed that was enough. </s>
<s> What might I be missing? </s>
<s> If I didn't provide enough information in my post, I'd really appreciate your advice on what other details I should include. </s>
<s> Thanks, Rita </s>
<s> &quot; Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> &quot; It is still possible that Windows 98 is not installed proper. </s>
<s> I know it sounds gruesome but 98 (or se?) </s>
<s> will not fetch or install drivers to make your USB ports work better than 1/2 of the time. </s>
<s> It's all up to the owner to sort that out. </s>
<s> In closing since you only tell it's a Dell, then you get to go there and find what drivers they offer. </s>
