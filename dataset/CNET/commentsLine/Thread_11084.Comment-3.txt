this was my first question.
i was referring to a couple of other posts regarding cd/dvd in this forum.
sorry if i mislead you.
thanks for the link to other question/answers.
it did answer one of my questions about jumpers.
i'll try the housekeeping routine first and a cd cleaner.
this isn't my pc.
i was helping a friend and i know she doesn't have the extra money to buy a new cd burner right now so was hoping there might be some other suggestions.
thanks patti
