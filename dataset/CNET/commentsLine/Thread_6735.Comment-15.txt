nice for you and your wife.
the e junk that i have now is not a three year old out of date pc it's suppose to be one of the best that they have and it didn't work right in the three months since i got it.
i don't know what your wife dues with her computer, but i need one that works.
yeah i got a lemon thats not the point.
the point is that they will not stand behind there product.
what good is a pc that you cant do any thing with?
you tell me that?
you didn't have any problems with your pc so i don't think your qualified you say any thing.
now when is time for you to buy your wife a new pc, you just go right on and buy another e junk and i hope it works for you, but if you luck out like a lot of other people ive talked to, good luck trying to get it fixed.
