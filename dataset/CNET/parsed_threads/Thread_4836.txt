<s> I changed hard drives. </s>
<s> I had an 80 Gig and added a 160 Gig. </s>
<s> I left the 80 Gig the master and made the 160 Gig the slave. </s>
<s> Then, I used the Western Digital program that came with the 160, Data Lifeguard Tools(Maybe I should have used Ghost, instead! </s>
<s> ), to copy the files from the 80 to the 160. </s>
<s> After that I switched master and slave since I wanted the 160 as the master. </s>
<s> I am using Norton System Works 2004 as a computer help program and have used it regularly. </s>
<s> When I ran it after changing HD's around, it showed a lot of errors. </s>
<s> I can run the WinDoctor and it gives me a bunch of problem areas mostly Invalid Active X/COM Entries (100 problems). </s>
<s> Those I can automatically repair. </s>
<s> But the one that worries me is: Drive Change from C to E. (177 problems) A removable drive has been inserted or removed, or, a director was moved to a new drive causing drive C to appear as drive E. These problems should not be fixed automatically. </s>
<s> If I can't repair them automatically, I have no idea what to do to repair them. </s>
<s> I did notice that when I tried to optimize, it got an error message that said it failed to open and I can't open it. </s>
<s> I don't know if its related to all those errors or not. </s>
<s> Also, I noticed that MS Outlook opens up but won't successfully send or receive. </s>
<s> Also, MS Word wants to &quot;install&quot; and then gives and error message but then goes ahead and works. </s>
<s> Anyway, can you tell me what to do to help with the drive change problem? </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>

<s> I apologize. </s>
<s> I wasn't getting a response so I thought I would rephrase the subject and better write the comment. </s>
<s> And then I thought I might be in the wrong area(s) for a response. </s>
<s> Anyway, I am not wanting to mess up my computer by doing something I shouldn't but I'm not sure what to do and it isn't letting me do emailing through Outlook (even though it opens up) right now. </s>
