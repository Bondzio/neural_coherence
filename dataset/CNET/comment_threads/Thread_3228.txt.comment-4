Yeah, d/l the sit, its not intrusive.
It will check your system and compare it to what Vista needs.
Understand also, that Vista will come in various flavours and need a *minium* to run for its most basic release, as more bells&whistles are added, sure it needs more.
As in OSes before it, I don't doubt that Vista(when openly sold) will run its own tests and see if it can be installed, thus the last test before installing for sure.
