but it's not as big as a studio xps 9100. i don't need that much hp.
i realize i won't be able to go with a monster 3d card, but i don't need to.
just one that's big &quot;enough&quot;.
(i believe tha precision workstation t1500 doesn't have a bigger case, and it's autocad certified) starting to see i really don't need that powerful of a card.
