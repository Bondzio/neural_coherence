hey guys quick question how come when i go play a game like FEAR or any other kind of new game with a auto detect performance thing it always puts my cpu at medium but i dont get that cause my CPU is brand new its a X2 4800+.
is it because it is only 2.4?
which brings me to my next question if intel has 3.6 and higher CPUs how come they are not better when the AMD only has 2.4 and 2.8 i think are the highest?
