hello, i am looking to buy a new desktop and i was wondering if i should buy a area-51 7500 or dell 710 h2c.
i am an extreme gamer and is looking for performance, so if any one could tell me which one i should get and why please tell me because i am on the fence with this because i like the fact the the dell is over clocked, but the alienware has a newer motherboard and faster ram and i don't know which one to chose.thx
