5900	0	136595	1537341	NR	tspavan	11/14/05 2:28 PM	1.13197848E12	HELP ME!!!	I have a Win 98 PC and a Win XP PC and have tried to join them together through a wireless network. I have a Linksys wireless router, and when I put the &quot;wireless encoding&quot; feature on, my PCs won't communicate, despite the fact that they can both use the internet. Shall I blame myself (please tell me what I'm doing wrong) or is it all down to Bill Gates?
