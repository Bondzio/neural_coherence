i have two 80 gb hard drives.
i've been thinking about using one just for my pictures,gif's,video,and music.
hoping that they would be safer on a seperate drive.
is this idea valid or not, and are there any other better ways to protect my files, other than the fact that i must back up my files.
i do use an antivirus program and firewall,and don't download anything questionable.
