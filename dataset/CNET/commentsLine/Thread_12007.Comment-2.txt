&quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; your os may have a rollback feature, but you neglected this tip so we have to fill in the blank spots first before which method can be used.
you may also want to try rebooting the computer and see if it clears up as well as look for any &quot;safe mode&quot; on the screen.
