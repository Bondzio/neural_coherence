i've never seen an intel or amd factory hs fan that draws air away from the cpu.
all those i've seen push air down over cpu to transfer the heat.
adding to that i've had a number of aftermarket hs fans (alpha, akasa, thermalright, etc.,) where the fan mounted on top and only one of those (can't remember which one) specified pulling air away versus pushing cool air over the cpu as slightly more efficient.
with today's aftermarket units where the fans mount on the side vice the top...the fans still push versus pull air over the heat sink fins vapcmd
