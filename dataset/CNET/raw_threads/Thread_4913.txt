(first time building a pc)	Okay, with the mobo I was going to either go with this ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131330 ) or this ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131362 ) With the processor, I was planning on getting the amd phenom 9650 AM2+ ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103288 ) I was going to get a wd 640gb sata hdd ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136218 ) I plan to get 4 or 6 gb of ram... I may start with 4gb and see if I need more from there (ram is cheap enough) (I already have the case) So, is this a good build? Anything you would change? I know the mobo has on board video, but I want to get a new video card. Any suggestions? I don't want to pay more than 150.00 on a video card. Also (and this should be the last question haha) what power supply should I get to run it all? Again, I am somewhat on a budget.

6573	3	331433	2985911	2985830	anthonypb93	2/22/09 9:04 AM	1.23529344E12	okay...	I do a lot of animating in a program called blender (blender.org) so that's the MAIN thing. I also plan to do some gaming on it in my free time (half life 2, crisis, ect.) I don't really need the games to run on &quot;full power&quot; lol. I also don't plan on having the pc on 24/7. I usually turn the pc to &quot;sleep mode&quot; when I'll be away from it for more than an hour or two. I'll be using windows vista premium (64 bit). okay, I'm going to change around my question a bit. This is my case ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811103011 ) is there something you can put together for around 600.00. I can go over 600.00, but I'd rather not. Am I going to get a good system for (around) 600.00 (give or take 100.00). Also, I prefer nvidia with the graphics card... and no, I'm not totally stuck on amd, I'm okay with intel. Oh yeah, I'm 99.9% sure this is my monitor ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8764483&type=product&id=1203815243481 ).

I'm sure either way amd/intel is going to do what you need it to do. I just think if your spending the money anyways why not get the fastest. Good luck!
