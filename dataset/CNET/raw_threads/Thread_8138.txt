I had formatted it to NTFS right when I got it. It works fine with my Vista laptop. But I now wish I could use it with more. I'd like to be able to connect it to my PS3 and 360 to get media off of it, and I use Windows and Mac both very much on a daily basis, so I think I'd like to convert to FAT32, but before I do, I'd like to ask if this is a good idea. I've heard things that FAT32 doesn't accept files more than 4 gigs? Also, if I do go through with this, how would I convert it? When I go to the format section of explorer, the only options are NTFS and exFAT. Thanks a lot.

With all the gadgets you're planning to connect to, someday you'll crash the disk and lose all. Get a flash to move your files around.

Also, I already have a flash drive, but I would prefer the convience of just keeping everything on the one hard drive. Is FAT32 that bad? I mean, it's the default format of the drive.
