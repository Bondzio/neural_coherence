I used a tester on the three prongs and this is what reads: Fan1= prong1 11.1v, prong2 .91v, prong3 is the ground Fan2= prong1 3.5v, prong2 9.53v, prong3 is the ground My BIOS has nothing for fan settings. I haven't found any program that controls my motherboard fan. The only trouble shooting was plugging an exhaust fan into all 3 fan oulets off my motherboard. It only works in FAN3. Is there any troubleshooting I can do with this problem, or is my motherboard going on me? Thanks for any info you can pass my way, -Joe

Gene Smith from Award BIOS told me there is an update for Bios, but that BIOS for my 7 year old motherboard has nothing to control or monitor fans. He said something about my motherboard having no sensors for fans. Is there any way to test my power supply, or trace for a short on my motherboard? Thanks for your input, -Joe

The voltages are modulated by a variable on/off cycle, thus the voltage readings cannot readily be accurately read by a Digital voltmeter [nor a D'arsonval movement. Got an Oscilloscope??? The chip probably got zapped. Get an adapter and run them at 12 Volts from a PS Molex.
