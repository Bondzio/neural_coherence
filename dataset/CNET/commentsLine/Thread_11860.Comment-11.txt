although you wont notice any difference if you choose a usb 2.0 adapter, it will stick out of the usb port an may get in the way on a notebook which increases the risk of it getting bent or being snapped off completely.
also usb adapters require drivers normally for them to work.
i believe pcmcia cards don't.
just my opinion anyway.
