<s> I have my XP connected with my ME via d-link. </s>
<s> How can I get access to the HD of the ME from the XP? </s>
<s> Do I just change the properties of the ME HD? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You should review such sites as: http://www.practicallynetworked.com http://www.wown.com to see if you forget a step (sharing a folder) or if you installed a firewall that is blocking the share. </s>

<s> First, make sure your two computers are in the same workgroup: In ME, right click on 'Network Neighborhood' and select 'Identification'. </s>
<s> In XP, right click on 'My Computer' and selct 'Properties'. </s>
<s> Choose the 'Computer Name' tab and click on 'Change'. </s>
<s> Next, on your ME computer, turn on File sharing. </s>
<s> Get there by opening 'Network' in the Control Panel. </s>
<s> Finally, choose the folder(s) you would like to share: Open 'Windows Explorer' (Windows Key + E). </s>
<s> Right click on the folder to be shared. </s>
<s> Choose 'Sharing...' Turn on sharing in the window that opens, and your done! </s>
