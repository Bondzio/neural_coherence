<s> I am currently running windows98se in an old Gateway that is at least six years old, and am considering buyin a new Mac laptop. </s>
<s> I don't do games at this point but we do take a fair amount of pictures, both with a digital and cam recorder. </s>
<s> Idea's? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if you are dead set on a laptop then the MacBook would be very suitable for you. </s>
<s> Discover the joys of iPhoto and iMovie HD. </s>
<s> However, if a lap top is not essential, a 17&quot; Intel iMac would also be a great choice for you You won't be sorry P </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your quick response. </s>
<s> The reason for the laptop is that I am getting close to retirement, and we plan on doing a lot of traveling. </s>
<s> And just from the reviews it looks like this MacBook would fill the bill. </s>
<s> BTW, I am not going to get rid of the old win98 computer, just yet. </s>
<s> I completely understand. </s>
<s> Now that you are close to retirement, and will be doing a lot of traveling, you have also decided to buy a boat. </s>
<s> That's good, because you already have one essential piece of equipment for it, a boat anchor! </s>
<s> Remember that W98 is no longer supported, updated or patched and continues to be a very insecure OS. </s>
<s> Be careful with it. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your timely advice. </s>
<s> I think a boat is a great idea </s>
<s> If you have the money to buy a boat, you might as well wait until the Macbook Pro gets the Memron processor and buy that. </s>
<s> Being older ( I assume this b/c your close to retirement) the bigger screen of the Pro may be easier on your eyes. </s>
<s> Other than that, the only advantage of the Macbook Pro that you could use is the backlit keyboard, it may also be easier to type on. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the keyboard is slightly bigger on the Pro than the Macbook? </s>
<s> As a writer, I spend long hours in front of a computer screen. </s>
<s> As a freelance writer--I spend 40-50 days a year on the road. </s>
<s> I tried the 17&quot; PowerBook for about a year, but it was too big for the backpack, and too heavy to lug. </s>
<s> The solution has been the new MacBook. </s>
<s> 2Gb of RAM and the 120Gb hard drive, a 17&quot; external monitor, wireless external keyboard and wireless mouse. </s>
<s> Heaven! </s>
<s> The 13&quot; screen is razor sharp when I'm in a hotel room, library or coffee shop (think: three different kinds of light), and when I'm in my home office, I have everything a desktop system affords. </s>
<s> Get a .Mac account. </s>
<s> MJM </s>
<s> there isent that much a difference the only difference is pro has a bigger screen </s>
<s> The MacBook with the 13&quot; inch screen is ideal. </s>
<s> It's very portablea and has a beautiful screen, (I have a 12&quot; Powerbook), everything is built in, including camera for video conferencing or even taking video on your trips. </s>
<s> Hook a video camera with Firewire (or even USB 2.0 Hi Speed) and you can use it for video conferencing using iChat or make your own videos live and use the MacBook with the camera inputting into the iMovie mode as a large monitor. </s>
<s> For a larger screen I have a 19&quot; Samsung flat panel monitor with built in TV and FM/AM radio sitting on my desk, but I can set it up almost anywhere. </s>
<s> I'm retired and always carry my 12&quot; Powerbook, a Panasonic or JVC DV video camera and my Nikon 4500 digital camera. </s>
<s> the mac book pro got the usal powerbook keyboard (haven t try the tippping feeling) & macbook got this new alins sharp, big bouton, water resistant </s>
<s> it doesn t mtter for our old man but the video card isn t the same </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The MacBook sounds like a wonderful choice. </s>
<s> If you do a lot of digital video recording and editing, you might just fill up your hard drive pretty quickly. </s>
<s> The biggest hard drive that you can get on the MacBook is a 120 GB (and that is a pretty expensive upgrade). </s>
<s> You might want to think about getting an external hard drive to store your videos. </s>
<s> The external drive is also great for backups. </s>
<s> A Firewire (IEEE 1394) drive will probably be fastest.) </s>
<s> You would not want to lose your important photos. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you can get the desktop iMac with a hard drive as large as 500 GB. </s>
<s> Just something to think about. </s>
<s> Dave </s>
<s> The reference to the boat was a joke, because of the old computer I currently use. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You don't really need that winbox. </s>
<s> With your Macbook, your Windows 98SE disk and a copy of Parallels Workstation (about $50) you can run all your Windows aps. </s>
<s> Just make sure you keep up your antivirus software for the Windows OS. </s>
<s> I had this same option not too long ago, and I chose the MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> I did like the MacBook (other than the fact that I prefer a 15&quot;), but here is what I chose the Pro for. </s>
<s> This may or maynot be important to you. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The MacBook Pro has its own video memory. </s>
<s> If you plan to do a lot of video from your camcorder, this may be a consideration. </s>
<s> This is especially true if you want to play with something like Final Cut Express. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The screen is a little larger. </s>
<s> I like my 15&quot;. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Most important for me, but probably irrelevant for you - I do a lot of recording of speeches, and I thought I might need a bit more muscle. </s>
<s> The 15&quot; that I got has a 2.16 GHz Processor and 256 MB of video RAM. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if I needed the video RAM, but someday I may put some video on it. </s>
<s> My MacBook Pro was quite expensive, though. </s>
<s> I got a 24-month no interest financing deal, or it would have been a difficult purchase. </s>
<s> The lighting of the screen adjusts to ambient light if you wish, and even the keyboard is backlit. </s>
<s> I've found it very pleasant to use. </s>
<s> I liked the keyboard better on the MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> I'd suggest you try typing on both and see which is easier for you. </s>
<s> The disadvantage of the Pro, of course, is that it is a bit bulkier. </s>
<s> So, if you are carrying it around a lot, this may be a problem for you. </s>
<s> Good luck with your decision. </s>
<s> As someone who uses both Windows and Mac OS, I do believe that you won't go wrong with either choice. </s>
<s> I'm in much the same situation as you, close to retirement and wish to travel and take along a computer. </s>
<s> My choice was the MacBook (the entry level model). </s>
<s> I bumped the ram to 1G and the hard drive to 100G. </s>
<s> I have nothing but good to say about his computer. </s>
<s> Screen and font size is not an issue even though I require glasses for reading. </s>
<s> Highlights include: ease of setup (detected my wireless network and connected with no problems), the full iLife suite, ease of use. </s>
<s> As the ads say it just works. </s>
<s> I also recommend the .MAC membership. </s>
<s> It integrates seamlesslly with all of the iLife programs. </s>
<s> The only down side is the track pad but then that would be an issue with any laptop (I'll be purchasing a blue tooth Mighty Mouse when they become available here in Canada). </s>
<s> But I do love the scrolling feature offered on Mac laptops. </s>
<s> The decision for me came down to $$$. </s>
<s> My Macbook priced out at about $1000 less than a similarily equiped MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> I couldn't justify the price difference for the features offered by the Pro. </s>
<s> BTW, buy the extended warranty. </s>
<s> It's not only cheap insurance but the phone support lasts the entire three years of the warranty. </s>
<s> I got the 2.0GHz white MacBook and added 1GB of RAM. </s>
<s> One suggestion I would make is don't buy RAM or HDD from Apple, buy it from outside since installing new RAM or a new HDD is pretty easy on a MacBook. </s>
<s> That 3 year warranty is worth its cost, go for it. </s>
<s> I have. </s>
<s> Udayan. </s>
<s> Just to update you all, I have recieved my new Macbook and am slowly learning how to use it. </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your help in helping me make up my mind. </s>
<s> Now I need to find a fishing boat, I have the boat anchor, An old Gateway running win98. </s>
<s> Glad to hear you are now using your new Macbook. </s>
<s> If you have any questions, don't hesitate to holler. </s>
<s> P </s>
