Recently I moved into my new student appartment and the only internet that was available was wireless. I have a wireless BT hub at the only port in the house and then a linksys router by my PC. By flashing the linksys router I was able to turn it into a receiver and so it goes straight into my network port in the back of my PC. Out of 100 pings to the router from my PC I get about 6-10 which are in the range of 70-130ms. The rest are either 1ms (mass majority) and 2ms. This is causing me problems ingame as I get about 3-6 ping spikes a minute which interupts my play. Anyone who can help? I'm using WEP encrpytion, and the linksys model is a WRT54GL.

Move the security up one notch to WPA and read this forum's sticky. Again, I must be harsh on this. I will not discuss WEP as it is dead. Bob

Tell if you did something other than the forum sticky settings. Again, WEP is not a solution as the kiddie tools swat the connection down and more. But that's been covered enough times. Bob
