That's the dilemma for you - it's not likely that the Opterons will drop in price - they're not technically consumer chips, and the Opteron division is healthy - no reason for them to cut prices.
The X2s will be dropping by up to 50% in the next couple of weeks in anticipation of competition with Intel's Conroes.
They next motherboard that I will buy for a 939 will be the DFI LanParty nF4 Ultra.
Pair that with an Opteron 165 or 170 with 2gigs OCZ PC4000 ram, and you'll likely hit 300+ X 9 or 10 = 2.7 - 3.0 ghz + with the proper settings.
So, you have to decide - go with an X2 in the $200 region, or spend another $150-200 on a chip that has the potential for 3.0 ghz.
