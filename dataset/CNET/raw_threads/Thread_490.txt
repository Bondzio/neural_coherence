Last time I was in the market for a new cd/dvd burner, I remember that the market was seeing for the first time drive that could also print onto the disc. Meaning that you would put the disc in and with a laser or something it would create like an etched image or title onto the label side of the disc. Am I imagining this or does it exhist?? if it does exhist do you have any reccomendations?? I have shifted my publication from a paper printed one to an all digital. So subscribers will be receiving discs instead of paper. I want to have a cool print on the disc instead of a paper label. I would probably need to create several hundred of these discs a month. If this doesnt exhist. Can anyone point me in the direction of a printer that prints directly onto the disc and not onto paperlabels?? thanks so much

Actually there's a third option from Pioneer, but that drive actually burns lettering into unused sections of the data side. Looks clever, but pointless to leave huge amounts of data store empty just to get some lettering in! Anyway the two options that burn images into the label side....here's a good review, amd comparison. http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/2006/02/14/labelflash_vs_lightscribe_dvd_uk/ GeeBee.
