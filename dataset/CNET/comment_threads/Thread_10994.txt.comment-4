Thanks for the advice, shylaugh.
An attorney friend recommended I send a registered letter to Dell, and explain that I do not want them to call me at work.
(My payments always seem to be late, even though I mail them WAY in advance.)
So today I am writing my letter and asking that they contact me in writing in the future.
Once they receive my letter, if they again call me at work I will have a legal case against their harassment.
Would you mind sharing the address where you sent your letter?
They have so many addresses, I don't know where to send it.
Thanks much!
Stephanie
