<s> I have heard a number of times before that sunlight falling on the back of CRT monitors (and CRT T.V.s) can negatively effect the monitor's brightness and life span. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if this is true? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Check this out. </s>
<s> It's good advice: http://www.envisiondisplay.com/products/Monitor_Optimization_Tips.pdf and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> Sunlight is accepted to deteriate plastics, insulation, heat up devices and in short decrease the lifespan of what you set in the sunlight. </s>
<s> This is not specific to monitors and why some building add UV filters to the glass or install shades. </s>
<s> As to brightness, it's all relative. </s>
<s> That's a nuclear powered light source to compete with. </s>

<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Sunlight is a heat source. </s>
<s> That added heat effects the innards of the CRT. </s>
<s> Overall, it shortens the life span of any electronics, to include a CRT. </s>
<s> Plus, if sunlight effects the viewing, typically the user will adjust for better display which usually is a higher output and again decrease the overall ideal properties of the CRT. </s>
<s> enuff said, hope this helps... tada -----Willy </s>
