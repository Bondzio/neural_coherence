hi everyone i've been looking for a tv tuner card the past couple weeks and would like a little feedback on what you think or like.
my preference would be a internal pci card.
i've checked reviews and opinions at a few sites, but you either love it or hate it.
theres two card in particular i've been looking at wintv-250 and leadtek tv2000 xp deluxe.
pretty big difference between them ( price performance encoding ect... )i don't mind spending the money if it's good but i just don't really know?
one more question, dvd compatibility.they have a list at  why would there be a defference between cd-r and cd-rw media?
i don't understand why for example the sony dvps 525d will only play cd-rw dvd's and not cd-r dvd's that would burned?
any comments or suggestions welcomed.
thanks in advance!
