1.2.1	Should take you right to Microsoft .	St
1.2.2	Re the virus ... better post that in one of the other forums .	St
1.3.1	4 infections that ca n't be removed could be culprits for your excessive memory usage .	St
1.3.2	you did n't mention what AV product you 're using , but perhaps you need to upgrade .	St
1.3.3	if you have a 'real ' win xp install cd ( not a recovery cd ) , you might consider picking up a new hard drive to temporarily replace your existing drive ( bb has a 120gb on sale for $ 60 ) .	Sug
1.3.4	remove your old hard drive and replace it with the new one .	St
1.3.5	do a fresh install of xp , install your AV software and get it up-to-date .	Sug
1.3.6	then add your old hard drive , scan and clean it , and recover your data .	St
1.3.7	after that repartition and reformat the old drive and use it as your d : .	St
1.4.1	If you go to Start , then right click on my computer , then properties , then advanced tab , then in the performance box , click settings , then advanced tab again , then in the virtual memory box , click change , then increase the number depending on your HDD space and your RAM .	St
1.4.2	If alot of HDD and RAM , then increase by alot .	St
1.4.3	If little HDD and RAM , then increase by a little .	St
1.4.4	Hope this helps .	St
