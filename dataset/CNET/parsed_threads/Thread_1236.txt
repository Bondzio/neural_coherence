<s> SYSTEM DETAILS: HP Pavilion m8400f AMD Phenom 9500 Quad-Core Processor 3.00 GB RAM nVidia GeForce 8500 GT ECS MCP61PM-HM Motherboard Vista 32-bit Home Basic A couple of months ago, I began to experience periodic BSODs. </s>
<s> I updated my drivers (Vista and nVidia don't play nice), scanned for viruses/malware (none found)--the usual culprits. </s>
<s> Everything seemed fine for a while. </s>
<s> Then, recently, the BSODs became recurrent, occurring almost every time I booted up (though sometimes everything would still run smoothly). </s>
<s> I ran multiple stress tests on the hardware and had a tech do the same. </s>
<s> It all passed, so I figured something had corrupted the OS. </s>
<s> I ran a complete factory reset but, after that finished, the OS wouldn't configure. </s>
<s> It errors out with a &quot;code purple&quot; every time. </s>
<s> I spoke with a rep from HP who advised me to reset BIOS by reseating the CMOS battery. </s>
<s> That didn't work, and either did resetting the defaults within BIOS. </s>
<s> That rep then suggested I bring the computer into one of their authorized techs at Walmart or Office Depot to update the BIOS manually (for cheap). </s>
<s> Techs in my area won't touch it, I guess out of liability concerns about ruining the motherboard. </s>
<s> They'll only send it off to &quot;central repair&quot; for $300. </s>
<s> Tonight, I then spoke with another HP rep who indicated that my motherboard is actually going/has gone bad if reseating the CMOS battery didn't work. </s>
<s> She said they need to &quot;repair the DMI utility of the motherboard stored in the BIOS.&quot; Cost: $199, plus the cost of a new motherboard if they can't repair the old one. </s>
<s> So my question is, does either diagnosis sound correct? </s>
<s> Could the recovery partition have become corrupted instead (in which case I'm at a loss)? </s>
<s> I can follow a guide and update the BIOS myself if needed, but I don't want to waste my time and risk damaging the rest of the hardware if the board is toast. </s>
<s> If it is, I plan on salvaging the working parts to upgrade my wife's desktop. </s>
<s> Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to make sure the case was clear. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time. </s>

<s> more often than not is the result of unrecoverable memory errors which could be due to the DIMMs or the memory controller in the AMD. </s>
<s> Have you tried reseating the DIMMs and, since you have 3GB, tried operating only with the 2GB stick? </s>
<s> If you are close to a computer store, get a known good DIMM to verify. </s>
<s> Forget repair services...a generic version of the MCP61P is about $50 but the back I/O may be slightly different...and replacing the mobo yourself means dealing with Vista re-activation...not impossible but not everyone likes dealing with it. </s>
<s> If the recovery partition is corrupted, ask HP to ship you Vista OEM (NOT recovery) CDs. </s>
<s> If you don't like messing with hardware, replace the PC. </s>
<s> For value, a new PC with W7 and better CPUs than the 9500 can't be beat. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> It wasn't the DIMMs or a corruption in the partition. </s>
<s> Looks like the mobo is the culprit after all. </s>
<s> I'll be salvaging the rest of the parts for various upgrades on other household comps and ordering something new with Windows 7. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> Much appreciated. </s>
