I do not wish to use two monitors or two keyboards or two OSs. My newer primary PC would be the link to the net. One printer would be used for both. How can this be done? How can I marry them together without creating a network of machines? What would I need? I have an old PC that I would like to use for its resources .... CPU, drives etc., to enhance my current system. Can I marry them together without creating a network? What about the OSs, Can I use one OS to run both towers? Is this possible?

Will need an OS on each machine though. As for sharing the resources/drives, you are going to need a network to share drives/storage. If you are using a router already then that will prbably have at least 4 ports on it. just get yourself a network cable or two and your done. Else get a crossover cable (not a normal network cable)and plug it straight from one machines network card to the other.

Drive letters also are of some concern. Using two C: drives being problematic fore instance. I'm all most certain the same brand of OS would be needed due to file extension problems for one example. Hmmmm, I do have an old ME OS around here somewhere. This router might do (I do wish it had a firewall. One Firewall would be better then two): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833124309&cm_re=routers_wired-_-33-124-309-_-Product

LOL Yep, that's much simpler and cheaper too.
