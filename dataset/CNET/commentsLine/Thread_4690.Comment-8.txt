can you explain how you configure your router to nat?
i have a linksys wrt546.
other people can connect to my wireless network and bring up webpages, but i can't using my laptop.
mylalptop also does not bring up webpages when i am staying at a hotel and accessing their wireless network.
there has to be something on my laptop that i am not using.
my desktop calls the wireless network &quot;smith&quot;, but my laptop calls it &quot;linksys.&quot; i am considering deleting the network on both computers, then trying to set up the network again.
it all went haywire when i changed from a dsl connection to fiber optics.
my laptop works fine at work on my work lan.
i uncheck the lan box when i get it to my house, so that is not the problem.
