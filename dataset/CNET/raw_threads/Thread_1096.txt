I have wifi here but it is weak. I have a linksys WRT54GS router. How can I connect my outside antenna cable to the internet plug of my router? Then I think I can get a stronger signal. Thanks in advance lwl0913

However a 20 foot cable is also unacceptable. You'll want to get that down to just a few feet. I do not offer to teach RF tech here but that's far too long and will create very odd issues. Bob

I had a bum one and here's one that worked well enough over the usual home. http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=RB-TEW424UB-WB-R I've ordered another one to try with my Cantenna which is this one (untested yet) http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=GWUE18SG&cat=NET -&gt; It would be in your best interest to reply to your top post and rewrite it clearly what 400 is and more.
