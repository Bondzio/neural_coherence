Right now I have been using the &quot;Jazz&quot; setting on the Equalizer. It's the one that sounds the best when using the included Ipod headphones. I have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get. Any suggestions? Thanks again, CHUSITO1975

About the EQ, you CAN create custom EQ for - NOT on - the ipod... http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61567 hope helps/..
