Have a Belkin Play N600 router with Tomato v 1.28 on it.
Both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when I use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when I'm using just one).
To get back online, I have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato GUI.
What's going on?
