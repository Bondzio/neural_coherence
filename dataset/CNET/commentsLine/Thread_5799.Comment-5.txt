hey budy.
i have had the same problem as of a week ago.
i tried everything finally me and my dad took my pc to the store and they said it was the out of date processor.
screw them.
i took it outside with an air can and sprayed tons of dust off, then i kept the tempurature in my room cold, and i put in two more 256 memory sticks.
i dont know what fixed it but try that and if its still screwed then i feel realy bad because i hated my comp when it did that.
now i am playing games like call of duty, at 1280 x 1024 all turned up.
i havent crashed since then and i have been trying to make it crash just to see if it will, and it wont.
