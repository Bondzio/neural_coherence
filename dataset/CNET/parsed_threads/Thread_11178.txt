<s> I know this should be simple but I have a user that is having problems with her printer, when she prints anything the paper come out curled up. </s>
<s> She happens to be the office manager I cant think of anything that would cause that, before I check it out I would like to have some ideas help quick thanks </s>
<s> Two reasons for paper curling, tension and heat. </s>
<s> Due to humidity and/or environment, paper is prone to curl to its weak side. </s>
<s> Its the way the paper ream was cut. </s>
<s> Leave a sheet of paper by a sunny window and show it start to curl overtime. </s>
<s> As for tension, when going through the paper path, the bends and curves will cause this. </s>
<s> Under heat more so, like in laser printing. </s>
<s> Cheap paper too is prone to this condition. </s>
<s> Again on tension, if possible use the straight paper path if available(some models do). </s>
<s> The tension rollers keep the paper firm in its paper path, but under wear&tear will lessen over time. </s>
<s> Any correction may cause less curling but over time will cause jamming, crimps, kinks or off-shrew as the paper isn't flat as can be. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> but I would like to add another thought. </s>
<s> Inkjet ink, especially in large amounts, has also been cited as a cause of paper curl. </s>
<s> A text page, which may have perhaps 10% ink, will not curl the same as as a photo page, which may have 90% ink coverage. </s>
<s> Also, the kind of paper and the kind of ink used come into play. </s>
<s> There are papers made specifically for laser printers, papers made specifically for inkjets, and compromise &quot;all purpose&quot; papers. </s>
<s> Inkjet papers also have a &quot;photo paper&quot; category, and there are sometimes special inks for these papers. </s>
<s> While these things primarily affect image quality, they might also affect curl. </s>
<s> And BTW, paper does have &quot;sides;&quot; the side toward the top of the package is always the &quot;better&quot; printing side. </s>
<s> The brand, grade, and weight (thickiness) of the paper could also be factors. </s>
<s> I suggest that you check the printer manufacturer's recommendations and, if the problem is serious enough, try different papers and inks to find the best combination. </s>
<s> Hope this helps a little Frank </s>
<s> but the reason was the feeder. </s>
<s> we had a tech come in and had it replaced. </s>
<s> but thanks for the help </s>
