my daughter left her ipod nano plugged into our emachines running xp all night long.
when we rebooted the computer in the morning - we get little or no power.
the computer seems to start up ok, the light turns green, then you can hear the power quieten down & the light fades to a pale yellow.
nothing works from that point on.
is this the power supply that has burned out or does someone know what else it could be?
