hey, bob, what's with the &quot;no further replies to this post will be accepted.&quot; to your last post?
i'm posting my reply to you here.
what do you mean about &quot;each application can have margins&quot;.
if i am opening up windows explorer to find a .jpg in there, then right-click on it to print it out..... how do you set a margin for that?
it's automatic.
i don't quiet understand what you mean.
when i said that i checked the margins, i meant in control panel -&gt; printers -&gt; printer model -&gt; the options for it.
