<s> so one day my pc froze and I turned it off with the power on/off button, than i tried to turn it back on, but it wont properly start. </s>
<s> there`s the first image that says HP events or smth, than a black screen with a white '' - '' glowing on the edge of the screen. </s>
<s> Btw i`ve tried booting it from a cd and usb flash - nothing. </s>
<s> - Ive got an HP pavillion dv2000 </s>
<s> Be sure to unplug all USB things and try again. </s>
<s> No go? </s>
<s> Try the generic reset. </s>
<s> Power off, remove AC, the battery, press hold the power button for 60 seconds, release, slip in the battery, apply AC and try again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> still nothing. </s>
<s> HP support website has a t/s routine that you can do. </s>
<s> Goto the HP website and enter your model# and look for it. </s>
<s> I believe the user needs to hit F1 or F10(depends on bios level), or some key(instructions on website) then follow repairs. </s>
<s> If a recent bios update or system upgrade and/or power status change, it could generate your problem. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Go get the service manual and power off, remove ac and battery (that's in the service manual) then remove the hard drive. </s>
<s> At this point, if it's the usual failed HDD the boot from USB and CD should work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so i actually got it to boot from usb, but startup repair couldnt fix it and when i tried to re-install vista an error showed up. </s>
<s> That might be interesting. </s>
<s> What error? </s>
<s> And what did you use as a source to reinstall it? </s>
<s> Usually Windows Vista doesn't come on flash. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> start up error or atleast smth like this. </s>

<s> : Windows cannot open the file required C:\Sources\install.wim. </s>
<s> The file does not exist. </s>
<s> Make suure all files required for installation are available and restart the installation. </s>
<s> Error Code: 0x80070002. </s>
<s> well yeah, i downloaded vista recovery cd. </s>
<s> If you can't install from an original OEM System Recovery disk or an original Microsoft holographed Vista install DVD after a total erase of the hard disk (use free DBAN for that) something is wrong with the hardware. </s>
<s> Better have that repaired. </s>
<s> If you install from a non-original copy, there's a good chance something is wrong with the copy. </s>
<s> In that case, contact HP and order that recovery disk. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> the recovery cd isnt original - its downloaded from the internet. </s>
<s> how do i contact hp. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> How to reach their customer service should be in the documentation that came with the machine. </s>
<s> If you can't find it, go to www.hp.com and find it for your country. </s>
<s> Should be possible. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> they dont send to my country. </s>
<s> It's a pity they don't send to your country. </s>
<s> Maybe the shop where you bought this machine help you to find something that works. </s>
<s> There might be a recovery partition on the hard disk. </s>
<s> If no help from the shop or the local tech, see if http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;Sources\install.wim&quot; leads to a solution. </s>
<s> If not, better buy an original DVD. </s>
<s> be sure you have or can download from hp.com all needed drivers for the OS you choose. </s>
<s> That might be difficult. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Many of those don't work. </s>
<s> If I needed to install an OS and get my machine up on the net today I'd look again at UBUNTU (see google) Bob </s>
<s> HP offers from their support website to order the recovery/restore disc(s). </s>
<s> They are for a small cost though but definitively cheaper than anything else and made for your PC. </s>
<s> Just goto the HP website, find support, enter your model# and check for the ordering hyperlink. </s>
<s> Provided they still have Vista available, its worth the wait. </s>
<s> As for any recovery via the WWW source, they usually is only for minor recovery possibilities. </s>
<s> Its a generic source of recovery so it won;t be capable to fix either true h/w faults or anything other than the basic Vista OS footprint. </s>
<s> I would also do this from disc rather than a flash drive if I assume you got the .ISO file. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
