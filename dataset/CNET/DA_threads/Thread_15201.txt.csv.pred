1.1.1	I only come to these forums once in a blue-moon when I need some real help from you wonderfully tech savvy ladies and gents.	St
1.1.2	Basically, the age old question, can you recommend me a great wireless router?	St
1.1.3	Been surfing around CNET trying to get some professional opinions, (looks like the Belkin N+ is my best bet), but I just wanted to double and triple check.	St
1.1.4	Basically I need a VERY FAST AND VERY STRONG router for GAMING.	St
1.1.5	I want 0 lag, and 0 kick-off (or as close as I can get).	St
1.1.6	&quot;Well why don't you just go wired?	St
1.1.7	Stupid.&quot;, I know, but I have a lot of pets and I'm trying to minimize my wire usage around the house, not to mention it's much more aesthetically pleasing.	St
1.1.8	Money is no issue, I just need something with a fast and solid connection.	St
1.1.9	Basically only gaming consoles (PS3, 360) will be hooked up to it wirelessly (not more than 2 feet away), aside from a laptop in the basement.	St
1.1.10	However, there will be two computers aside from that hooked up wired.	St
1.1.11	Just need some outside opinions or research before I make the plunge.	St
1.1.12	Like I said, I've been looking into them and the Belkin N+ seems like my best bet, but I'm not 100% it's great reviews are put through their paces in a gaming setting.	St
1.1.13	Any other suggestions?	St
1.1.14	Links to reviews I could check out?	St
1.1.15	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Oh, by the way, I'm aware the things I'm connecting to are only Wireless G, but I intend on buying a computer or two in the future with Wireless N connectivity, so I figured I might as well get a router now to utilize that rather than upgrade later.	St
1.3.1	If there is one thing I've learned, gamers don't like Wifi.	St
1.3.2	Get wired.	St
1.4.1	Thanks.	St
1.4.2	Any one have any actual recommendations?	St
1.5.1	Get one you can install OpenWRT or similar on.	St
1.5.2	I've found this to make a bad router good and a good router better.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Alright thanks, I'll keep an eye on that.	St
1.6.2	What's your opinion on the Belkin N+ I mentioned?	St
1.6.3	I know it got top honours here on CNET, but I just wanted to be sure it is, in fact, the best wireless router out there when money is no concern.	St
1.7.1	We have some fine discussions about N and how it didn't deliver the goods for some.	St
1.7.2	In fact if you can't keep all the gear from one maker you often find yourself disabling &quot;N&quot; and sticking to &quot;G&quot;.	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
