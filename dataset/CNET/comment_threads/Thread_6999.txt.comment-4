Before I opened my wallet I would look into free stuff like finding the proper mobo and vid drivers that mated to the OS I was using and gave me the best perf.
Don't assume the newest drivers are best, you must test.
I don't know what type of vid perf your looking for but I suspect that 800cpu and 100memory are going to be a problem.
