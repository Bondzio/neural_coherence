<s> Hello, I have 4 laptops (3 vista and one XP), and a Netgear WGR614 (it came with the virgin connection). </s>
<s> I wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless. </s>
<s> Please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay. </s>
<s> A step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Air space is shared space and the impact of more than one machine on the air is just a bad idea that no one should entertain. </s>
<s> How about 4 routers and configured like post 17 in our forum sticky? </s>
<s> This way each machine gets it's own wifi connection all to itself! </s>

<s> Ok, So are you saying that too many computers on wifi is a bad idea because of the radiation? </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I understood it wrongly. </s>
<s> Also, if its possible, could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> This is not an issue of too many users. </s>
<s> What you may just be learning about is how wifi works. </s>
<s> Sure, what you asked can work but the gamers would grumble about ping times and the gamer with the wired connection would have the edge. </s>
<s> I offered a solution to that. </s>
<s> :could you help me to set-up a lan with the stuff which i already have? </s>
<s> : Sure, just do what the manuals told you to do. </s>
