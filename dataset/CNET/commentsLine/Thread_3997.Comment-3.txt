typically non-volatileram is used to store the bios code itself, as well as your bios settings.
checking nvram generally consists of running a checksum on the nvram contents to determine if the contents have changed.
i have no idea why your bios is running a self check now where it seems it hasn't before, but it certainly should be harmless to let it run.
if the nvram is being held by the battery, it may be that your battery is low.
(although that is not usually the kind of nvram used for the bios)
