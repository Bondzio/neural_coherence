St
1.3.3	Do i need that new power supply ( is it necessary ) and also , i was looking at the motherboard connections ( USB , PS/2 on the back and they do n't line up with the case .	St
1.3.4	Is this a problem ?	Ques
1.4.1	USUALLY motherboards will come with one of those things to put on the case .	St
1.4.2	do n't worry once u do the first boot and it works : u 'll feel gud .	St
1.4.3	Oh yea !	St
1.4.4	PLZ CHECK ALL CABLES ESPECIALLY FANS BEFORE EVEN PLUGGING ANY TYPE OF POWER IN !	St

1.4.6	CHECK !	St
1.4.7	TRIPLE CHECK .	St

1.6.1	Probably new psu , as the ones with the case really sucks ... Low amps on the +12V .	St
1.6.2	Wattage is n't the only factor when purchasing a psu .	St
1.6.3	the two i said are pretty good .	St
1.6.4	I would 've gone for 3000+ , because the 3500+ only has a higher clock speed , that 's the only difference .	St
1.6.5	You can save quite a bit , and if you really want 3500+ , i suggest getting a 3700+ San Diego instead because the 1MB l2 cache is very useful .	St
1.6.6	Do n't get ATI due to no SM 3.0Support , you do n't want to be playing games in Direct X 8.0 in the future .	St
1.6.7	Go for either a 6600gt , or 6800 instead .	St
1.6.8	Do n't forget arctic silver 5 , it 's way better than the stock , and $ 8 a tube seems like a good investment into a $ 300ish processor .	St
1.6.9	Do you have windows ?	Ques
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	I think i got what you guys suggested .	St
