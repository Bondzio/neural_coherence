i having a problem that is driving me nuts.
my router seems to be droping my internet conect for 1-2 seconds every 10-30 min.
if i connect directly to the modem all is fine.
i have tried two moodems and get a very similar patern.
i have talked to both the isp provider and the trendnet suport people to no avail.
the big issue is that i play on line games and this interuption short as it is seems to cause games to drop.
also ventrilo, yahoo messenger and msn.
when i bought the new router the issue seemed to go away for a while then it returned after a few days.
an ideas?
