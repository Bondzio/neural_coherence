I have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable.
I had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds and connections were great.
The problem is with my new laptop.
I no longer have the old laptop.
My new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds were really slow.
I took off the security and set a MAC filter list.
My speed is good now, but I keep losing my connection for no reason!
When I reconnect it works fine for a while, then it's gone again.
I have changed from channel 7 to 6.
