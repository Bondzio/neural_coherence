I guess it's about 3 years old, maybe more. I have run W2000 from the gitgo. Sometimes it runs slow and I think it's time to reinstall windows. I have the original W2000 disks. I would like to copy all pertinent information. Programs are no problem since I have all original disks. My problem is with things like passwords saved, email messages saved, favorites etc. My data files, like Excell spreadsheets I have created are no problem since I am able to save those to CD. My problem is I don't know exactly what else to save and how. For example, I don't know the location for my favorites that I use when I'm on the web. I am using IE, latest version. Lastly, should I consider just junking this computer and getting a new P4? I would still need to know how to copy pertinent information. Thanks

You seem more of the user variety and may have difficulty with motherboard and more drivers that Microsoft will not find and install for you. Since you don't backup, it's too likely you will lose something or everything since your skill levels appear to need a little work. But there is hope. 1. Look up EWIDO on download.com and use that to eject what it finds. Your tools are known to have a few holes in them. 2. BACKUP. That's the big issue along with you might make ONE BACKUP only to discover it can't be restored. Make 2 or 3 (I have no less than 3.) Now is not the time to entertain a wipe and install. Bob
