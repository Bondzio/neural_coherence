I heard that if one is using core duo or core 2 duo series processors (or not using the new Core i 3/5 etc processors) an external HDD of 1 TB or above might not work properly?
I mean they say it would be slow or it might not be compatible etc etc.
So, in short, I am using Windows 7 ultimate, 2 gb or RAM, 2 + 2 gigs of core 2 duo processor on hp dv 6500 special edition and I am planning to buy WD My Passport Essential SE (1 TB), so would have I any issues or would it be ok?
Or may be I should just buy the My Passport Essential(500 GB)?
Thanks in advance.
