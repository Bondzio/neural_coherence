My computer one day decided not to boot.
It hangs right after the bad quality bitmap &quot;loading windows 2000&quot; screen and instead of jumping to a login prompt just sits at a blank screen.
To make a long story short, I ran three versions of the manufacturers utility and none of them found bad sectors on the drive.
So when i dropped the drive into a working windows 2000 box and tried to chkdsk it says the following... C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&gt;chkdsk H: The type of the file system is NTFS.
Unable to determine volume version and state.
CHKDSK aborted.
What can I do to fix this?
I've searched high and low and well I haven't been able to find much of anything.
