good day, i have the following, emachines t6524 amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.2ghz / 1gb ddr / 200gb hdd / dual layer dvdrw/ integrated ati radeon xpress 200 / flash media reader / windows xp media center 2005. i have looked at the ati web site and am confusied as to what would be the best next step up on the graphics card.
i have 1 gig of memory and a 200 gig hard drive.. there seems to be many choices just not sure which one would be best.
thanks in advance for your reply
