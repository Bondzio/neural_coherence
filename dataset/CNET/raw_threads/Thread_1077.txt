For the most part im pretty sure i have a good grasp on what i want and need except for the video/graphics card... I do a lot of work with 3DS Max, Solidworks, CAD, Photoshop & Illustrator CS3/4, etc.. and Im not sure what video card would be best for those applications. I hardly do any gaming what so ever. At the moment i have been looking at the ASUS EN9800GT. I have heard good things about it from multiple sources but nothing pertaining to its performance on 3D modeling. Does anyone have any suggestions as far as what card would be best for 3D modeling? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
