Does your burner s/w have any diags or testers?
If yes, run them and what are the results?
Next, you seem to cover what should be done to try to recover, but if you have a truly used DVD drive or one of the cheaper drives installed, they simply don't last that long, a 1yrs worth of use, expect some problems.
About the only real test of assurance of a bad drive is to swap it out and install a new one.
