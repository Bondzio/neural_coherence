the problem is you look and you see a new technology will come out soon or the price will drop on a current one.
so you wait a coupple of months and oh dear there is something new and faster, so you wait for it to get cheaper and you get into a purpetual cycle of doom.
the real answer is get it when you need it.
christmas is often a good time and just after because thats when all the deals come out but i would advise you spend 800 (if you dont need a new screen) annd a bit more if you need a screen.
this is quite pricy but if you search around you should get something pretty lasting.
