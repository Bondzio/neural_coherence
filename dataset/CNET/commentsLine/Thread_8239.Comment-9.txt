ben, thanks so much for your reply to my question.
the brand recommendation if very much appreciated.
also your specific statements of range are very useful to me.
i do have one question further for you if you can help.
what effect does the 50% signal strength have on the speed and/or dependability of your work on your network?
do you see a decrease in speed of operation?
do you experience a degradation of accuracy of transmissions?
thanks...joe w...
