1.1.1	A co-worker of mine is having problems with a noisy hard drive.	St
1.1.2	The HD appears to be &quot;working&quot; (HD light flashing along with the noisy &quot;clicking&quot; coming from the HD itself), but it will do this continuously, even when she is not using her computer.	St
1.1.3	She is running WinXP.	St
1.1.4	The only thing I've found on the matter so far is that the HD is preparing to crash, but this machine is new (about 2 months old) and I have read that crashing is a problem of older noisy drives.	St
1.1.5	What could or would be causing the noise?	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance for your help.	St
1.2.1	Two months old?	St
1.2.2	Backup all important files IMMEDIATELY.	St
1.2.3	Make it a warranty issue.	St
1.2.4	Did it come with the computer or was it purchased separately?	St
1.2.5	HD model number?	St
1.3.1	I don't know the HD model number (I posted yesterday, she is out today).	St
1.3.2	I am inclined to agree that the HD is faulty, but our latest suspicion is that the computer may not actually be ''new.''	St
1.3.3	When she received the machine, the case had a few dings on the front, and then the side panel (which you would remove to service it) fell off.	St
1.3.4	We were able to put it right back on, but it probably would not have been loose if someone hadn't been inside it to begin with (just suspicions).	St
1.3.5	She saves all her work to the server, so she doesn't necessarily risk losing her work, but we are still worried about it.	St
1.3.6	And we're VERY skeptical about the legitimacy of the computer itself.	St
