<s> I'm going to be going to school for web designe and i was wondering what I should look for in a desktop. </s>
<s> I only have $1000 to spend and i need a monitor to go with it. </s>
<s> HELP!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> A good graphics desktop needs a powerful CPU, something like a SPARC. </s>
<s> There's a reason why CAD/CAM was run on theses machines for awhile. </s>
<s> most web design apps don't need a lot of horsepower. </s>
<s> photoshop is the only app that can overtax an underpowered pc. </s>
<s> but that's only when editting large images and, for web use, images are relatively small. </s>
<s> when shopping for a desktop, get at least 2gb ram, a mid-level dual core cpu (athlon x2 5000+ or core2duo e6550 or higher), a large hard drive, and a large monitor. </s>
<s> here's a gteway that can handle adobe dreamweaver cs3, ms visual studio, etc. </s>
<s> Gateway GT5656 athlon x2 6000, 3gb ram, 500gb hd, $616 acer 22&quot; widescreen LCD, $270 these prices are from circuit city, but you can find similar pricing elsewhere. </s>
