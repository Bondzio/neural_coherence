Hi - Not sure if there's anything that can be done however I live in an area jammed full with wifi networks.
Lately I notice more and more difficulty with my own network dropping me, reducing range, etc.
I already have an external omnidirectional antenna added onto my Linksys.
Is there a brand of router that could be recommended with more power or a way to boost the power of my existing network?
It could be my apartment building at fault but I doubt it only as things worked fine for the first few months we were here.
Day by day I've seen more networks spring up.
Thanks in advance - Matt
