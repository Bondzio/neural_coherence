<s> But I wonder what OS? </s>
<s> I'd want Windows 7 64 bit. </s>

<s> I have windows xp. </s>
<s> The days pass so fast. </s>
<s> I'd get the OS people are now optimizing for. </s>
<s> Then i should get Windows 7 64-bit? </s>
<s> The 32-bit OS has known issues with over 2GB RAM installed. </s>
<s> You can research that area. </s>
<s> I know many think XP is the last great Windows OS and for them they may be right but that list you gave is what we use on the new OS. </s>
<s> If you must run XP, configure it for XP. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For month ot 2 i will get windows 7 64-bit.So,i dont think that i should change something in my configuration.Cause 64-bit runs great with 4GB ram </s>
