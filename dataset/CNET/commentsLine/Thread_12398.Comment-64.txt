i have not had the issue of the 2nd side flaking.
i just finished a job doing double sided programs - using black only, and mostly text.
the problem i ran into was this.
after printing 130 sheets double sided of stardream cardstock, it started to jam.
it would print the first side fine, and when it pulled it back in, it jammed.
i let it cool a bit (was worried i was working it too hard) and then switched to printing on my stardream text stock which was the inner piece.
it printed 170 of those double sided no problem but when i went to do the cardstock again, it kept jamming.
although since it doesn't print both sides at the same time, it's just as easy to put it through the printer twice... did you get your envelopes to work?
was that you?
