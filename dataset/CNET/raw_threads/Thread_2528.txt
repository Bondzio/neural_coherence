You need to boot from the CD to install OS X. OS X has thousands of invisible files that do not move when you copy the drive. There are programs that will do it though, Carbon Copy Cloner being one, but you will still have to boot from something other than the drive being cloned.

The CD-ROM drive in your iMac is IDE, if you theoretically were to unplug the CD-ROMs ide and power cable and they were long enough to reach the HD then you could format and mount the new HD. It might take a little tinkering but it is possible... Maurice

I'm not clear whether you intend to replace the internal HD with new one or put it in a external case. However, since I must guess, I would recommend that you download Carbon Copy Cloner (donation ware) from versiontracker.com onto your internal drive. Then buy or borrow an external HD case and place your new HD in that. They come in USB, Firewire or both. Use Firewire if your iMac has it. Then use that software to clone your entire internal HD to your new HD. Then you can replace your internal HD with the new one if you like, or just leave it connected as an external one. iMacs do not have a IDE connection for a second HD as do PowerMacs, so transfering data via IDE cable is either very difficult or impossible. Good luck

The ide cable on an iMac is exactly the correct length and will not reach the top of the CDROM let alone another HD. No power cable either. The guy needs to purchase a replacement CDROM and all this will go away. Sooner or later he will have to install something that is on a CD. The external Firewire/USB option and Carbon Copy cloner are also a possibility.
