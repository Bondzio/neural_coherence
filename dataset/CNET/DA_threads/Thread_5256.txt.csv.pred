1.1.1	Looking to buy a 500 GB USB external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	Nothing fancy, just want something reliable.	St
1.1.3	Any experience with a good one?	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance, Gabe Quashnofsky	St
1.2.1	Seagate internal hard drive and put into a USB-2 case.	St
1.3.1	I have two SimpleTech external drives that have run without a glitch for over a year or more.	St
1.3.2	One sits on my work desk, the other I carry around in my day bag with my laptop.	St
1.4.1	I just bought one for $60.	St
1.4.2	Although I am not a USB fan but I just couldn't let it pass at this price, hehe.	St
1.4.3	It seems to have good speed.	St
1.5.1	I recommend that you do not buy Seagate (Maxtor).	Sug
1.5.2	I bought a 500 gb and now that I want to buy a new computer I have found out that it will not work with VIsta 64 bit.	St
1.5.3	Nothing on box says this.	St
1.5.4	Says it is compatible with Vista.	St
1.5.5	THey should of said Vista 32 but they did not.	St
1.5.6	No plans for new drivers either.	St
1.5.7	Just be sure that whatever brand you buy it specifies Vista 64 bit as this is the os that will soon be the norm and 32 bit will be out.	St
