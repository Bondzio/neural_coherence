if i were in the marker for a new desktop and ws not going to build one myself, i would probabally buy an asus brand from a reliability standpoint.
whatever you do, stay away from anyting hp or compaq.
their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible.
the specs may compare, but is the quality of the parts that matter.
