<s> I'm getting a new computer for my mom. </s>
<s> She now has a four-year old emachine. </s>
<s> The only reason we're upgrading is because she wants high-speed internet and her current machine doesn't support it. </s>
<s> She basically does email, AOL, web surfing, word processing, printing, copying and faxing. </s>
<s> She may get into some low-in web development but nothing much. </s>
<s> I've found two HPs both on sale at Best Buy. </s>
<s> I can get one with all-in-one printer, Pavillion a804n (Celeron 335), and 17 in flat CRT for about $616, after rebates, including taxes. </s>
<s> The Pavilion a1000n (Celeron 340) with basically the same features goes for about $675, after rebates, including taxes. </s>
<s> She'll end up with two printers either way, the one that comes with the bundle which we'll probably trash and the all-in-one she really wants (HP Office Jet 5510). </s>
<s> My question: is it worth paying the $60 extra to get the Celeron 340? </s>
<s> My brother hates emachines (awful experience) and since he's splitting the cost with me, hp is the way we're going to go. </s>
<s> Thanks for you help. </s>

<s> the hps are not a bargain. </s>
<s> Get the emachines t6212, when it's on sale, its a lot cheaper and emachines has changed for the better recently. </s>
<s> I had problems and called them and their customer support was great. </s>
<s> They sent me a brand new dl dvd+_rw drive to replace the broken one. </s>
<s> Get the emachines,they're not a bad company since acquistion by gateway. </s>
<s> I own 2 recent Compaq machines and 1 emachine t5026 also recent. </s>
<s> They're both good, but for the value, i would go for the emachine... You won't find many complaints of the t6212 by people here on cnet. </s>
<s> As for the question, the 335 and 340, it's just the clockspeed. </s>
<s> It's not worth 60 to just get a higher clock speed. </s>
<s> Celerons are really bad processors. </s>
<s> The emachines comes with an AMD 64, with 64-bit support for the future and a pci-express (x16) slot for graphics upgrades. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> cant seem to find the a804n at bestbuy. </s>
<s> however i dont think there is a difference just dat the a804n is a older model i think. </s>
<s> also, just out of curiosity, what was wrong with ur brothers emachine as i own one and so far it has been excellent and when i had a problem with my dvd drive, they sent me a replacement in 4 days. </s>
<s> my mom had to return her initial machine twice, but remember this was four years ago. </s>
<s> She ended up satisfied so my brother decided to go emachines. </s>
<s> A nightmare. </s>
<s> He finally returned the machine and got his money back, but American Express had to get involved. </s>
<s> It was the worst customer service experience I'd ever heard of. </s>
<s> Even though my mom has had no problems with her machine, my brother won't even consider another emachine. </s>
<s> I liked them but I also want him to pay half the cost so I'm giving in. </s>
<s> Oh, yes, it's HP a804n-b or a804x-b. </s>
<s> I don'tlike what I've been hearing about HP but I figure if it works out of the box, we're good to go. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, we take it back to BestBuy for a refund. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Angie </s>
<s> I've tried but my brother is not budging. </s>
<s> His past emachines experience has soured him completely. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Emachines is a great company and they make great computers. </s>
<s> They have risen from the bottom to one of the top dogs. </s>
<s> I was hesitant at first but now I'm more than satisfied. </s>
<s> I've had my T3256 for about 6 months now. </s>
<s> There hasn't been any problems what-so-ever, not even one glich. </s>
<s> It's performed like a champ, has taken everything I've thrown at it. </s>
<s> (wow we're such nerds) Just search emachines in these forums and you'll find maybe 1 negative thing. </s>
<s> Search Dell and you get Dell sucks!! </s>
<s> blah blah. </s>
<s> Not that I dislike Dell, just Emachines has a much better rep. My next OEM computer purchase will probably be an Emachines again. </s>
<s> Cuz they're just that good. </s>
<s> Haha </s>
<s> The machine needs more memory, a hard drive upgrade, a NIC, a new operating system. </s>
<s> It's more than four years old so it doesn't have a DVD or a CDRW. </s>
<s> I just think it's time for a newer model. </s>
<s> We've offered the present machine to a cousin who doesn't have a computer and she doesn't want it. </s>
<s> Too old, she said. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> FYI: I went to Best Buy last year to buy a computer for my mom and had an emachine in my shopping cart. </s>
<s> The clerk advised me not to buy it; said a lot of people had been bringing them back. </s>
<s> Honestly, I had it in my shopping cart and he talked me out of it. </s>
<s> I couldn't believe it. </s>
<s> I left with a monitor. </s>
<s> Yes, her monitor went out last year. </s>
<s> Like I said, after the false starts, my mom didn't have any trouble with her emachine. </s>
<s> Let's hope the HP holds out as long. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, my brother will get it in both ears. </s>
<s> Angie </s>
<s> I work at BestBuy and emachines are by far the biggest selling computer out there. </s>
<s> You get more bang for your buck. </s>
<s> Our repair shop atleast in my store see's more HP's and Dells in for repair, and we dont even sell Dell lol. </s>
<s> I've had both HP and eMachines and no trouble with either brand, they are both well made machines. </s>
<s> At least the ones i've had. </s>
<s> I think a lot of the trouble folks have is the error message: PEBKAC, lol </s>
