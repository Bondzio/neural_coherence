i use 3 250gb drives, there is a valid reason for this.
1) on c drive i have my o/s, drivers and any other programmes that must be on c.; 2) d drive holds all my various programme files and any games i have installed.
; 3) e drive has all my personal data files (such as word or excel files that are irreplaceable).
this is done deliberately.
i did have one of the drives (the c drive crash on me, it also wiped out my d drive however, e drive was untouched.
with a single drive even though partitioned this would not be the case - the whole drive would be wiped out, meaning that unless you backed up the data section regularly you would lose everything.. my motto better safe than sorry.
