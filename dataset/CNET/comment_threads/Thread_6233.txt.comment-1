Recently I decided to build my own computer so I went to the library and got a PC book...
It's a couple of years old but I figired that was ok because I only wanted to become more knowledgable about computer hardware and a few other things.
Anyway, in this book the author was talking about AGP cards and that they are much faster than PCI.
I just got to wondering if anybody uses AGP now that PCIe has come out...
Thanks!
