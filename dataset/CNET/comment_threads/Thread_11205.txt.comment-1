Without switching out my MOBO, Im looking to get the most out of the upgrade potential for my current Socket 939 system.
By the middle of next year, I will build a new system around an AMD AM2 board or Intel Core Duo CPU, but I dont want to jump into that until then.
In the meantime, again, Im looking to figure out the best upgrade options for my current system.
My main priority is to get the most gaming potential from my current system as possible: I play BF2, COD/COD2, Oblivion, Red Orchestra, Day of Defeat mostly FPS games.
For my job I also multi-task quite a bit with internet browsers and the Office suite (I dont really do any DVD/CD burning or anything like that).
With the fall of the AMD 64 X2 prices, my immediate reaction was to grab a 3800+ X2 (or higher) and another gig of ram.
However, Im unsure about the performance gain Ill get from the new CPU and Ive heard that if I fill up all four of my memory slots that my system will only run my RAM at 333 rather than 400 (is this true).
So, Im wondering if I can get a significant performance gain by 1.
