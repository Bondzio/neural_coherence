the heat sink is, or is supposed to be, attached to the processor with a clip.
the clip is shaped so that it exerts downward pressure on the heatsink.
it has a slot in both ends which attach to a plastic hook on the processor seat.
this is the same as many pc heat sinks are attached.
there should be some thermal paste between the heat sink and the processor.
you should not operate your computer until the heat sink is correctly attached.
you will fry the processor if the heat sink is not attached correctly.
