but it's not as big as a Studio XPS 9100.
I don't need that much HP.
I realize I won't be able to go with a monster 3D card, but I don't need to.
Just one that's big &quot;enough&quot;.
(I believe tha Precision workstation T1500 doesn't have a bigger case, and it's AutoCAD certified) Starting to see I really don't need that powerful of a card.
