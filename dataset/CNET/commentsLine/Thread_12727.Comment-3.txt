and if you go get your cpu &quot;specs&quot; show your pentium d 3.2ghz to be 69.8c maximum.
yours is beyond this so i'd at least leave the cover off until you can get some fresh heatsink compound.
then i'd get the hsf off, clean and put on the fresh compound.
i can't count how many times i'd seen a tech remove the hsf, look at it and put it back on without even a small drop of compound to help fill in the voids they created.
