ibm may be the most reliable however thy are not the fastest.
having worked for a manufacturer of aluminum disks for hard drives, i know that fujitsu was the toughest specs to meet but their drives were the least reliable, due to the large failures of their notebook-size drives.
quantum fireball drives have been the most reliable and predictable drives i have used in my diy machines at home.
5 years is their life span, and usually, a new machine is being built within that time frame, and new hard drives are installed.
