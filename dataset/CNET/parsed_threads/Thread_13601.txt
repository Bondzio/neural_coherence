<s> Hey cnet, I ran a diagnostic test on my laptop because it was having some problems, and it found these errors on the hard drive: Error Code 0F00:1A44 and 0F00:0244 Does this mean that my hard drive needs to be replaced? </s>
<s> Or can I reformat it and it'll be ok? </s>
<s> It still boots up so I can try to salvage some of my files. </s>
<s> It's 320G, only about a year old. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You always do that first. </s>
<s> Your choice to try the format and re-use. </s>
<s> I don't need unreliable parts in my machines. </s>
<s> I tend to gift them away. </s>
<s> Why gift? </s>
<s> So there is no doubt that I find the parts to be worthless. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, right now I'm running a chkdsk and probably going out to invest in a portable harddrive. </s>
<s> Gonna throw my files onto that and then reformat...hopefully the drive isn't physically damaged. </s>
