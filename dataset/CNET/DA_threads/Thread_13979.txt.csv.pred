1.1.1	ANYONE HAVE THIS ITEM THAT CAN SAY WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORTH IT	St
1.2.1	I bought this tablet at NCIX for $122+tax.	St
1.2.2	They are no longer available from that seller.	St
1.2.3	A different tablet of the same size can run you $500+.	St
1.2.4	The pen works really good especially if you have carpal tunnel.	St
1.2.5	A regular mouse makes my hands fall asleep and my fingers go numb.	St
1.2.6	I'd been using the pen almost exclusively since I got it.	St
1.2.7	I work on a computer all day long and it's nice to be able to come home and use my pen mouse.	St
1.2.8	The cordless 2 button scroll mouse is nothing special.	St
1.2.9	the weird felt strips on the bottom attract lint.	St
1.2.10	I've not used it much.	St
1.2.11	The tablet itself is a cheap kinda silver colour.	St
1.2.12	It could have been made prettier like in black or another colour.	St
1.2.13	The surface is very large, maybe too large for my uses.	St
1.2.14	I probably just use about 1/4 of the tablet.	St
1.2.15	It is currently holding some photos and a dvd right now and I still have enough room.	St
1.2.16	My recommendation is that if you can by it for cheaper than a really small one like a 4x5 for $150, then go for the big one.	St
1.2.17	If you are needing it for work, buy the more expensive one and write it off as expenses on your taxes.	St
1.2.18	If you just want a new toy, why not get this one.	St
1.2.19	If you have carpal tunnel like me, go for it!!!	St
1.2.20	Your hands would thank you.	Polite
