I have just installed one gig of memory and bought a new Radeon 9250 256Mb PCI video card (no AGP) on board video sucked. That last thing I want to do is find a better way to keep my system cool I am wondering if there are any good external cooling systems that would get the job done. If there are no good external cooling systems can anyone recommend a good cooling system that would be compatiable with my system.

Since, you mentioned a HP system, whatever you get has to fit, physically as HP cases tend to be cramped. Try for ideas or hints/tips/clues look for &quot;modding websites&quot; that explore just about any changes that can be done to a system provided you're game enough.
