Yep, that is a solution that can get sharing via Windows Workgroups going again.
The ability to connect to the Internet (rykdawgg6601's original problem) is independent of whether file sharing on a local network is functioning.
rykdawgg6601 should be able to get the router to connect to the Internet whether or not Workgroup file and printer sharing is enabled.
