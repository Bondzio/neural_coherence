thanks for the answers thusfar.
basically, what i would like to have is a little bit bigger screen, but it doesnt necessarly have to be a 22&quot; screen, a 19&quot; wide screen could be just fine.
so far, i have been looking at dell, samsung, and hp monitors.
i know there is a blue billion generic brand monitors, and while i have nothing against them, i question their reliability as well as quality.
i wont be doing anything but surfing the net, watching dvd's (not worried about high definition for the most part) and running online poker programs such as pokerstars (  ) as well as the various other online poker sites.
i would either like built in speakers or some usb on the monitor itself, it does not have to have both.
(if it did that would be great, just not required.)
if i need to sacrafice a little smaller screen to have a better picture (resolution etc) then so be it.
i really don't want a monitor that makes it hard to read text.
(yes, i use clear type) the nec multisync 1700m+ that i've had for about 8 years has been outstandingly reliable, but was made in 2001, and im sure there are some new monitors out there that would just blow my mind when comparing this nec to whatever is so many years newer.
i have looked at ebay, at pacificgeek, ecost, and a few other sites and have been trying to look at the innumerous lcd monitor reviews, and keeping them all straight has become quite a challenge.
i have hoped to come across a review site that had a dropdown of features so i could compare easier, but i have yet to find such a site.
again, thank you for any input you may have, i am not as technologically (is that a word?
heh) smart as many are.
thanks again.
all links to monitors that might fit what i am asking for would be greatly appreciated.
