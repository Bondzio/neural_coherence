<s> I have Windows XP on my keyboard. </s>
<s> Does anyone know the name of a computer keyboard (and how to get one) that has a very soft touch, similar to the touch of the old IBM Selectronic typewriter? </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>

<s> I have the same request for my laptop. </s>
<s> I was unable to test at the time of purchase and would find a softer touch easier to work with. </s>
<s> Is there a way to adjust? </s>
<s> My solution -&gt; http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=KBD.jpg This keeps the laptop keyboard clean and new over the years and I can choose from many on the market. </s>
<s> How to choose? </s>
<s> Go shopping. </s>
