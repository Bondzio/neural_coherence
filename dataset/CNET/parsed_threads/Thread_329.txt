<s> I am trying to see if anyone else has this problem. </s>
<s> I am a two finger typer, but type fairly fast. </s>
<s> I write a lot on my computer, every day. </s>
<s> Generally, I look at the keyboard when typing. </s>
<s> I also tend to type hard, but this issue is there even when I try to type softer. </s>
<s> My problem is that I'll type a paragraph and then look up to proof my text and a significant number of characters are missing. </s>
<s> This has continued with three different systems and multiple keyboards (wired and wireless). </s>
<s> Apparently, the problem is me, but I am still fascinated by this matter. </s>
<s> I spent a tremendous amount of wasted time adding characters that are missing. </s>
<s> Given I type with two fingers, AND I stare at the keyboard, I cannot fathom how so many characters do not appear. </s>
<s> So far on this posting, I have had to add five missing characters. </s>
<s> Just imagine how many corrections I have to make in a year. </s>
<s> This single problem must cost me days of wasted time. </s>
<s> If you have any suggestions, I am open to anything. </s>
<s> I have even thought of filming my typing to assure I hit each key, but could not get a good camera angle. </s>
<s> I would need to use at least two cameras. </s>
<s> Anyone else experiencing this? </s>
<s> I cannot offer any reason as to why the keys are being missed, if indeed they are, but I could offer some help when it comes to adding the characters back in. </s>
<s> Do you have the System Wide spell checker turned on? </s>
<s> If so, all the words with missing characters should show up as spelling mistakes. </s>
<s> Right click them, choose the correct word and replace the word. </s>
<s> Gotta be faster than inserting a character. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I use 10.6.2 OS. </s>
<s> Where do I turn on system wide spell checker? </s>
<s> There is some sort of spell checker running in most applications, so I suspect it is on. </s>
<s> However, for some reason, in many cases where a character is missing, the computer does not report it as a misspelled word. </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I tried filming from the front, but could not get a good camera angle. </s>
<s> I'm thinking maybe I need another person to film as I type, moving the camera as needed. </s>
<s> If I am physically missing this many keys, I may need my brain jump started. </s>
<s> Typing this simple passage above, I had to insert four missing characters. </s>
<s> I am perplexed. </s>
<s> BTW, I am a 53 year old man, educated, and a writer. </s>
<s> Just in case someone might think I'm 18 and really have not typed that much. </s>
<s> Two years ago I went to an Apple store and had someone watch me and he said I was hitting the keys, even when charters did not appear. </s>
<s> He thought I typed too hard, but as an ex computer tech, I cannot see how that would matter. </s>
<s> I try not to type too hard. </s>
<s> if you are seeing Red underlines when you type in this forum, then the Spell Checker is on. </s>
<s> To check, go to Edit &gt; Spelling & Grammar &gt; Check Spelling as I type. </s>
<s> Spell checker should see words with missing characters as misspelled, unless the word still makes sense. </s>
