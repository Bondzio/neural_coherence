I have a list of the hardware I'm going to buy. - Graphics card: GeForce GTX 580 - CPU: Core i7-950 - Motherboard: ASUS Rampage Extreme III Republic of Gamers - RAM: 2 x 6 GB Kingston HyperX - Hard Drive: Hitachi Deskstar 7K2000 - Blue-ray: BH10LS30 Super Multi Blue - Power Supply: Corsair TX650W It would be nice if you could make some comments about what you thought about it and may also make some suggestions on what else I can buy but it should not be much more expensive than what I've already selected. Thanks in advance

Idk if you already have a case or not. - Make sure you have a couple fans since that is gonna generate alot of heat. - That is an excessive amount of RAM unless youre using your computer as a server. Nothing wrong with it but it would save you alot of money to drop to one 6Gb stick. 4Gb is sufficient for almost all games right now. - I prefer Western Digital hard drives for myself. If ur looking for speed maybe check out one at 10000RPM's instead of 7200 - And hopefully youll be using Windows 7 on a machine like that.

If you look into them stick with the &quot;BLACK&quot; since they are built better, run cooler and have better warranties than the green or blue. Cost a little more but are worth it.

I'm getting the impression this mobo uses tri-channel. 4GB per slot limit and maybe 2GB per slot limit depending on speed. I'll let you dig into that. http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Rampage%20III%20Extreme
