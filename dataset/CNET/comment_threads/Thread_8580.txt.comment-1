What kind of performance increase would I be looking at from a Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66Ghz 1333Mhz FSB to a Intel Core 2 Extreme 3.0Ghz 1600Mhz FSB?
I only use my computer for school and, more power hungry, video editing.
I'm told my processor is already super fast for what I do and most apps are geared toward only duel cores anyway.
All that aside, however, I do have a weakness for the latest greatest stuff.
If I did get the core 2 extreme with a 1600Mhz FSB, I would have to get a new motherboard.
How much of an increase in performance would I be looking at if I went with an Intel Core 2 Extreme of only 1333Mhz FSB, but still 3.0Ghz instead of the 1600Mhz FSB?
