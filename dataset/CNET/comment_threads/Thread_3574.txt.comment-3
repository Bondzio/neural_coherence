I recommended them to a co-worker who called and tried to order an advertised PC.
The girl kept trying to switch him to a higher priced model that hew did not need.
He called back the next day (last day of the promo) and was placed on hold repeatedly.
He complained that he was at work and needed to get the order placed ASAP.
The guy told him he could call back the next day and he had noted that the sale price would be honored.
Naturally the next day they refused to honor the price, and tried to tell him that the RAM was not upgradable because it was soldered in and not plug in.
I told him to call Compaq and the guy suddenly found out the RAM was upgradable.
Joe thanked them, hung up and caleld Compaq, and had his system in two days.
I had not been a Compaq or HP PC fan, but I have had good support from both and am extremely happy with my new HP.
