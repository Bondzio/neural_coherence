Yea I assembled everything at once :/ POWER LED is the one on the motherboard I have speakers/sound blasters The 'speaker' 4-PIN front panel connector is just not there I can't explain it, the case didn't even come with a manual...
I'm going to try what you said.
Atleast I don't have to swap the HDD and drives to do that would be a pain.
