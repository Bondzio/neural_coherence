I was all ready to go however a friend of mine told me that if my motherboard was to give up the ghost I would lose all my data unless i find the exact same motherboard and plug the hard drives in, this worried me as the whole point of setting up a RAID is to have data protection, my thought was there is nothing fancy going on, just a simple copy of data will exist on both hard drives, I mean I thought even if I take both hard drives and put it in a totally different machine I Can setup RAID 1 mirroring again if needs be and it wouldnt be a problem. My motherboard is the Abit KN8 series with the Nforce4 chipset, I think the RAID utility built into the motherboard is by Nvidia but not 100% sure on that. Any help or answers will be very much appreciated as I'm very confused! Thanks

For years I've seen this one as owners scream as the virus duplicates on both drives or wipes both drives at the same time. If the OS makes a mistake, then it's dutifully copied to the mirror. No sale here. I won't write how the delete key figures into this one. Bob

As for delete theres always recycle bin (there will be very little access if any from the network). After a little research there is backup software available such as retrospect, so I might just take that route with scheduled backups twice a week or something. If you were in my position Bob what would you do?, I really dont want to go towards removable media like DVD's, hard disks are much more conveniant and with the 5 year warranty even if it only lasts 5 years I am happy. I will have to do a bit more thinking, I might just have to go towards using software like retrospect. Thx again

This gives me 6 or 7 days till a file I deleted is long gone. I don't bother with backup of the OS, programs or such. You can determine your needs and make a plan you can live with. Bob

That might be the best way then, one final question, what application do you use?, I need an application which is reliable you see, after some reading up retrospect seems ok but would like to hear about what you use.
