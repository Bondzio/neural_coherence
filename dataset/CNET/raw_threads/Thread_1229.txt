I am also debating if the router will work for SBC/AT&T. Can anyone tell me what kind of routers/type routers will work for SBC? Thanks, I appreciate the help

Pick one that fits your needs, and most if not all routers today will have wireless. If you just want to do general surfing and email, any good router will suffice. I personally like and use D-link and have for years. Linksys is good also. Just be sure, if possible, that you match vendors with devices. This means a (for example only) D-link router and D-link NICs. Or use all Linksys. I've found that devices from one vendor are usually more compatable with each other.
