Thanks Darton fury.
Now, if there is a password placed on that account is there another way to get in or do I have to rely on that individual to get me into the system?
As you can see, I am a novice at this stuff.
I wont be able to try this until I get home.
I will keep you informed.
I appreciate the assistance.
