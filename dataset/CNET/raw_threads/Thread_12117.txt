We tried a wireless router (asante friendlynet FR1104-G), but the signal strength seems only strong enough to reach one floor up or down from the router location. The floors are concrete, and the walls are concrete/brick with metal frames. Hardwiring from modem to other floors is a very last (and expensive) option. Any other solutions?
