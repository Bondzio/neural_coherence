WEP and WPA simultaneously?
You just get one.
Some good wireless security practices: - enable WEP or WPA - disable SSID broadcast - use strong passwords/keys - change wireless password regularly - enable MAC filtering - don't use default SSID, router name, admin password - don't let range of broadcast go too far outside home.
