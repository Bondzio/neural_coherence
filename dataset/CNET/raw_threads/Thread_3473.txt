I went to the link setup by netgear but the webpage won't display or it takes me back to the support of netgear website and it wants me buy a online tech support for the router and the cost is more what the router originally cost. do u have a better and easier way of doing it

It took all of 2 tries to get to the routers web page to set it up but no CD was needed. I hear you want to know how to do this but if there is some other issue such as a bad cable or forgotten info then it gets harder. I then press the reset button on the router and read the product manual again. If that fails I may replace the router. Bob
