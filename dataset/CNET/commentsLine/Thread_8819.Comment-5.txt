i can only *assume* you're talking about a &quot;overdrive kit&quot; type of thing.
i don't recall such an item, it's probably cheaper(maybe) to get a new mtrbd.
that truly supports dual-core cpu and go from there.
that way, you'll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed.
if you can provide that amazon link, review it again and match it against your current system specs.
otherwise, its a dead-end for dual path, only a single core will do.
using the link i provided in the last, find the upgrade link and post a question to emachine support and see what they may suggest.
heck, it doesn't hurt to ask.
