i have a asus p5n-mx motherboard intel pentium processor e2160 kingston ddr2 667mhz 2+1 gb wd caviar green 500gb phoenix bios windows 7 32-bit i turn on my pc and i can't even see the bios page.
power indicator does turn on, but my monitor is blank, i have checked everything including my monitor, but no sign of faulty cable.
i have removed my ram and test again, normally the system with no ram will produce a long beep, but this time no beep is produced.
i have also checked the cable on the motherboard, none of them are loosen or connected wrongly.
