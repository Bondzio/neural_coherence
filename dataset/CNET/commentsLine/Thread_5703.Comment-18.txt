i just tried office max brand of canon ink for my all-in one and the black started to either dry too soon or clog the print head.
returned it and replaced with canon brand to fix it.
now about to try premium imaging products (made in china..damn it!)
from  hope it will be better.
i don't think any off brand will ever be as good as the original for any printer.
