I took apart my notebook and cleaned the heatsink.
The problem still resumes.
The computer simply locked up except much less than 30 minutes.
One thing I noticed was that even though Windows was unresponsive - I was still able to change screen brightness by pressing FN and the up button.
Does this mean that the motherboard is still functioning despite the crashing?
