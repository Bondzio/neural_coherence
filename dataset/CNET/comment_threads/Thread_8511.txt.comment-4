My mobo upgrade was basically the next model up.
Same CPU, same drives, same everything except new one has DDR3 support as opposed to DDR2 on the old one.
Using latest nvidea drivers, GPU-Z reports same temps., usage as old board so I don't have a problem with settings.
I want to take it apart and inspect it, really getting 'hands on'with the hardware can't be beaten but I am not sure how to take it apart.
The first step is to remove the plastic housing that covers the complete bottom side of the card and I ain't sure how to get that off.
