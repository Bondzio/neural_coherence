<s> I'm using win xp sp2 and have just reformatted. </s>
<s> But then it my computer will crash/freeze like every hour and becoming more frequent, until recently it will crash every time right after I startup windows when I turn on my comp. </s>
<s> Every time right before the crash/freeze occur, I would hear a slight clicking sound from my comp, sounded like its from the HD not the floppy. </s>
<s> Then after I restart, I will get the message disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter. </s>
<s> I then check the boot options on my BIOS and notice it isnt detecting my HD. </s>
<s> But my floppy which is what I have set as a priority to boot from is detected. </s>
<s> Ive always had the floppy as the primary boot drive for the past few years and no problem until I recently reformatted. </s>
<s> So now Im just wondering what the problem is? </s>
<s> Is it my HD, my operating system or something else? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Did you try a new hard disk? </s>
<s> Have had this same problem when installing a new motherboard in an e-machine. </s>
<s> The IDE cable was to short and was not in the motherboard all the way. </s>
<s> If you moved your cables around inside your computer, it is more than likely the formentioned problem </s>
<s> ok dumb question, you dont happen to have a floppy inserted d you?? </s>
<s> have you physically checked your HD? </s>
<s> check the disc itself for scratches or indentations. </s>
<s> and yes you will need to try another hard drive in your mobo. </s>
<s> have yu tried a different port? </s>
<s> have you set the jumpers correctly? </s>
<s> spoon </s>
<s> unplug it then plug it into the motherboard again. </s>
<s> Check those jumper settings. </s>
<s> If there not right it wont go. </s>
<s> It should boot from the C: drive first not the floppy. </s>
<s> Might need a new drive. </s>
<s> Do the above first then find a spare and test to see if it's shot. </s>
<s> If it beeps see the beep codes at the manufactures web site. </s>
<s> These will tell you where the trouble is, maybe. </s>
<s> This thread is untracked. </s>
<s> if it isn't installed already. </s>
<s> Did you try a boot floppy and did it booted ok (you didn't mention)? </s>
