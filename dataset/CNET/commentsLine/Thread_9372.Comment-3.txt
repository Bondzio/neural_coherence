i guess i should've included this, but i'm running pc800 rdram in my system.
because it was a custom order they left out several of the hardware manuals.
it's now that i'm upgrading some things that i've been looking into the specifics.
and your responce gave me an idea, so i found a new tool that showed my speed back at 400. the one that was giving me 100 was from compaq's (hp) site.
i contacted them as well, and by their lack of information and knowledge in their responce, i think that their tool was more of a basic preconfigured automated responce for standard prebuilt units (which carry the regular ram like you mentioned).
since mine was custom, it didn't fit the profile that was given.
thanks for your help.
