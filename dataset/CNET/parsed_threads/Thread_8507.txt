<s> The technology has passed me by in the last 5 years. </s>
<s> My pc has an intel proccessor rated at 1.8 ghz. </s>
<s> Now thay are talking about dual and quad core at 2.2 ghz. </s>
<s> This is a little confusing to my 68 year old brain. </s>
<s> I need a new machine but need to understand this before I go forward. </s>
<s> Thanks to anyone that can help me. </s>

<s> Was more than enough for web, email and more. </s>
<s> Unless the machine is dead I'd stand pat. </s>
<s> If you do go shopping for a new Vista machine my short list for a happy Vista is 2GB RAM, any of the dual core CPUs and that's enough unless you play those 3D games. </s>

<s> If you're by any local shops and/or office outlet stores, try a look and feel of those new offerings. </s>
<s> Get your hands on one or several and see what to expect. </s>
<s> The plain truth for typical systems now is Vista(the OS) and the Mac if you care for one. </s>
<s> But, no matter what you like, just be sure it fills your needs. </s>
<s> Its going to be the same computer you had before just newer and obvious technology, being faster, stronger and capable(if you believe the hype) but again, just try to fit your needs. </s>
<s> If you care to, look online for what many maker's like Dell, Gateway, HP, etc. </s>
<s> offer at least on prices and the tech specs comparsion against maybe those you've checked locally. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
