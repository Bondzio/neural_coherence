i want to clear up an old subject.
my friendly computer techie told me i was doing the right thing to limit my software to windows compliant and stay away from anything that starts with an 'i'.
i am still scared of itunes, i'm so happy with my music storage, playing and management using wmp - i'm talking about maybe ten years - using things like dell dj (obsolete) now using zune and buying an htc aria phone because it has htc sync which will sync outlook with no problems or weird accounts.
now i am drooling at ipad 2 wifi only.
would someone give me an honest, clear critique about my attitude and my fear of itunes?
thank you.
