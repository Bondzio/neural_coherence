i would have to agree with this statement.
as long as you stick to the major brands, it is a matter of luck of the pick from the assembly line.
one extra step i sometimes do is google the model number to see if there is a larger than normal amount of complaints for a particular model, so i don't get stuck with a device that has a design flaw.
