<s> Hi I've got an ASUS A8N-SLI motherboard with the above processor. </s>
<s> I installed all the pieces myself. </s>
<s> However, the chipset fan is occasionally flakey - makes a racket trying to get up to full speed - and my PC seems to like to freeze more often than I would like. </s>
<s> So I would like to return the motherboard... but am afraid of breaking heatsink/cpu/something. </s>
<s> Has anyone got instructions for removing the CPU - simply reversing the installation would appear to risk a, too much brute strength and b, nasty separation of the heatsink from the CPU. </s>
<s> Thanks Darren. </s>
<s> clamping mechanism, [to me the brute strength seems a little bit of an overstatement] you'll find that the thermal grease/tape seems to have bonded the CPU. </s>
<s> Simply gently rotate the HSF a little in each direction and it will come free with no problem. </s>
<s> Of course to take the CPU you must gently depress the ZIF lever,move it outward a skosh and lift it up. </s>
<s> The clamping mechanism is two parts... the black lever, which is fine, but then the main heatsink assembly is clipped down - that's what seems to require a lot of force to unclip... feels like I'm having to attempt to push it through the motherboard in order to release the clips Got a busy weekend ahead of me so will have to give this another go next week. </s>
<s> re: thermal stuff... does that come off easily enough, and any recommendations on what brand to use when I put it all back together? </s>
<s> Cheers Darren </s>
<s> a thermal pad??? </s>
<s> Either way it shoul;d be thoroughly cleaned of from both surfaces. </s>
<s> If you make certain that the cleaning solvent only touches the heat sink base and the heat spreasder of the CPU, you could any mild remover product. </s>
<s> I simply do not recall that the bracket is difficult to remove when the black lever(s) [I remember two]are released. </s>
<s> With the mobo mounted in the case there is no support behind it, thus remove the mobo from the case and lay it on a piece of cardboard and the black antistatic pad that came with it. </s>
<s> That'll cushion the mobo so you won't damage it, if you really have to push that hard. </s>
<s> maybe get Arctic Siler, other than that just use the plain old stuff you get from Radio Shack. </s>
<s> Remember Arctic Silver is also an electrical conductor so take extreme care that it doesn't get on any electical parts, such as CPU contacts et al. </s>
<s> Thanks for your response Ray. </s>
<s> I've only got one black lever on my assembly. </s>
<s> Then these two clips which were a bugger to get in properly in the first place, and seem even worse to get out. </s>
<s> Last time I had a go I was trying to do it with the mobo in place, next time I'll remove it and have another go... and cross my fingers, toes and everything else. </s>
<s> Cheers Darren </s>
<s> so that it can't flex, it'll go much easier. </s>
<s> I had forgotten that I always put the CPU and HSF on with the mobo out of the case. </s>
<s> The only times that I have removed them is under the same conditions. </s>
<s> I hate seeing the mobo flex so much when it is mounted in the case. </s>
