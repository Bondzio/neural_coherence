We lent it to our daughter Wednesday. Today we tried to reinstall it but are having problems. Actually, it did come up once but it froze our system. Since then we have been unable to bring the hard drive up. We are using Windows XP. How can we reinstall this drive without having problems? Thanks. The system information is OS Name

Have you tried the cable in a different USB port, sometimes plugging into the front panel port will work when the back panel port won't. Is your daughter running Windows or possibly a Mac?

I gave up on the La Cie for a while but tried again this week. I am still having the same problems. My daughter's computer uses WIndows XP. I have contacted LaCie and tired all their suggestions including downloading an update. However, my computer still freezes if the LaCIE is on at restart. Then if I turn it on , the computer recognizes the drive but I have been unable to write to it. My husband does not think it is the cable because it worked on our daughter's computer. I'll try plugging into another port but I'm not sure we have a front panel port. It worked so well last year on both my computer and one other that I thought it was terrific. I am disppointed and frustrated with the current problems. SHould I just give up and order another hard drive?

Proffitt	5/20/05 8:30 AM	1.1165778E12	Given what is written and ...	&quot;my computer still freezes if the LaCIE is on at restart&quot; If this was my machine, I'd search for the maker of the motherboard's web site and install their latest MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE. Windows XP does not know or supply drivers for AMD based motherboards. They have a basic package, but not something I would use too long. At http://www.asus.com.tw/support/download/item.aspx?ModelName=A7V600-X I see USB 2.0 drivers and the motherboard driver packages. Microsoft will not fetch or install such for you. Best of luck, Bob
