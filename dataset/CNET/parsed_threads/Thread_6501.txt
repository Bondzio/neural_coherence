<s> Ok, so i'm in the market for a new desktop. </s>
<s> I've been looking around at different types of computers, IBM, HP, Gateway, Alienware, the usual suspects. </s>
<s> Now, i currently have a Dell, and despite a few problems, i have had few complaints with them. </s>
<s> Tech support to me is probally a lower issue for me, as I can troubleshoot most issues that arise. </s>
<s> I'm a power freak. </s>
<s> I love raw computing power. </s>
<s> I play games off and on. </s>
<s> Mostly the computer would be used for internet, playing music, email, etc. </s>
<s> I don't want to build my own computer. </s>
<s> So what type of computer, just the computer, do you think is best? </s>
<s> Dell Demension 8400 Power Mac/I-Mac Alienware Area-51 3500 Some HP Pavilion Some IBM </s>
<s> Something has happened to alienate one brand name. </s>
<s> They are also not shipping the product as you agreed to, substituting parts to get you the machine and hope you accept it. </s>
<s> For now, they are to avoided until they learn to treat customers with respect. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, i just saw that on Alienware. </s>
<s> Doesn't look good. </s>
<s> So much for A+ support. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> IBM is not about the latest fire breathing system. </s>
<s> So you decide if you like their units and what remains to be in the PC industry some of the best support. </s>
<s> The Apple is top in service and if you pump enough into a box you have a nice dual CPU machine that will run what you can have on the Mac with ease. </s>
<s> The HP/Compaq has a wide selection from boxed ready to use units to custom units that can be what you want. </s>
<s> Service seems to be above average. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Just a few more things about each company. </s>
<s> IBM. </s>
<s> I noticed they weren't the fastest, coolest, etc computers, but my sister has had her laptop for years and loves it. </s>
<s> Tech support seems good. </s>
<s> However, do you think that the recent buyout of IBM will affect tech support or quality? </s>
<s> Apple. </s>
<s> Seems awesome. </s>
<s> Only 2 problems are obviously the switch of OS, trying to transfer my files and software, if at all. </s>
<s> Other problem is cost. </s>
<s> Not sure if I'm willing to shell out 3k for a computer. </s>
<s> I had bad experiences with a Compaq laptop. </s>
<s> Nothing but problems. </s>
<s> Did the HP purchase improve tech support/quality at all? </s>
<s> And lastly Dell. </s>
<s> What about the 8400? </s>
<s> I think that looks good, but I got my laptop right before the Dell boom, and I am unsure if the product quality has deterioated. </s>
<s> So bascially, I'm wondering about the quality of the actual machines for the price. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> I'm writing from my observations and what I see in our office and from the field... IBM isn't sold yet. </s>
<s> In fact the Feds seem to have the last say here. </s>
<s> So far, no change has been noticed from what little I see. </s>
<s> Nothing in the major news either. </s>
<s> Let's call it a &quot;steady Eddie&quot;. </s>
<s> Apple. </s>
<s> For top performance, you need the bucks. </s>
<s> File transfer isn't the hassle it used to be. </s>
<s> Doesn't sound like you have a great reason to go there. </s>
<s> Certainly if gaming is one thing this must do... </s>
<s> The games are nice that appear, but not all do (Halo?) </s>
<s> HP/Compaq. </s>
<s> Again, let me keep this personal. </s>
<s> In my personal collection there are now 4 Compaq laptops. </s>
<s> Two ancient Pentium class machines that won't die and 2 Athlon 64 models from last month's upgrades. </s>
<s> The units look and feel great. </s>
<s> While the video is all of the Nvidia 420 Go with 64MB RAM dedicated, some gamers will still not be happy. </s>
<s> I'd get more of these at the office. </s>
<s> We haven't had any issues with HP or Compaq so I can only write about old (2 and up year laptops) that people need repairs on. </s>
<s> The laptop way of things send some into convulsions when they see the repair bill or estimate... Dell. </s>
<s> Have many at the office. </s>
<s> Boring machines that work, people drop or kill and if it's not abuse, Dell fixes. </s>
<s> Bottom line? </s>
<s> I like all the above makes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks man. </s>
<s> I'm glad i've picked decent models. </s>
<s> You're advice has helped a great deal, not i get to pick </s>
<s> i dont know about how you may feel about this, but i thought i could throw it out there. </s>
<s> how comfortable do you feel with asembling your own system. </s>
<s> pick the raw power that you want yourself. </s>
<s> for me, researching the latest and greatest is just as impressive as using it. </s>
<s> (well, almost...) </s>
<s> I'm not crazy about building my own system. </s>
<s> i could probally do it, but i don't have the time really to invest in learning about all the parts and assembly necessary to get a good system </s>
<s> The Dell has the 925XE motherboard and new 6xx Pentium 4 with DDR-533 everything the best, and is cheaper than getting it at alienware </s>
<s> Just bought another Dell Desktop yesterday. </s>
<s> Plain vanilla 4700 for office. </s>
<s> Couldn't beat the components at that price and free monitor thrown in. </s>
<s> However - last year wanted a really hot home system and called Polywell and had one configured. </s>
<s> Could name which video card, sound, nic etc. </s>
<s> and they would build. </s>
<s> Very nice on phone and got exactly as ordered. </s>
<s> Not a company for handholding but they are responsive. </s>
<s> Better than building your own cause you get what you want exactly and all burned in and working. </s>
<s> Now I'm looking for a good new system for me. </s>
<s> I've headed over to Velocity Micro and am working on a config there. </s>
<s> Haven't heard much either way on them - another not so huge company - so think I will try them out as their machines are getting good reviews in the mags. </s>
<s> I still love my now 3 yr old IBM laptop. </s>
<s> It's a workhorse. </s>
<s> Have not had good luck over time with either Compaq or hp except for hp printers and the old Ipaq. </s>
<s> One thing I've learned with any system. </s>
<s> Absolutely necessary to put them on an UPS not just a surge protector. </s>
<s> The newer machines are all very sensitive to even tiny power fluctuations and the UPS makes it all smooth. </s>
<s> Has made all the difference in the world in &quot;no problems&quot; with weird crashes etc. </s>
<s> on all our machines. </s>
<s> Happy hunting. </s>
<s> I always love an excuse to go computer shopping. </s>
<s> I would suggest holding off for just a little while buying HP, Compaq, and most others if you plan on buying a Pentium 4. </s>
<s> Pentium 4 recently introduced their 6xx models with 64-bit (EM64T) support. </s>
<s> It seem like most companies are still trying to get rid of their Pent 5xx models. </s>
<s> The Dell 8400 Pentium 6xx would be my choice as of now and it has the Intel 64-bit(EM64T)support. </s>
<s> Alienware 51-3500 in their basic $1142 with Pent model 5xx doesn't show me much. </s>
<s> http://www.alienware.com/Product_Pages/desktop_all_default.aspx This Dell 8400 would be much more and better equipped customized around $1041: http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=ussd&cs=19&kc=6V658&l=en&oc=D84MC&s=dhs#bottom_anchor </s>
