&quot;my user manual says that it supports 1.5v or 0.8v & not 3.3 v agp card...so im not sure if its still gonna work...?&quot; You may not be digging deep enough to learn that the AGP cards ask for the voltage from the AGP slot rather than the AGP slot voltage being &quot;fixed&quot; at some voltage on the motherboard.
I decline to duplicate web content on this subject and will stand on my prior answers.
