1.1.1	Hi Let me explain my scenario .	St
1.1.2	I have two laptops .	St
1.1.3	One which has windows xp and connects to internet pppoe dialup using isp name .	St
1.1.4	It has wifi also .	St
1.1.5	Another laptop with windows7 and wifi .	St
1.1.6	Now from this laptop i would like connect to internet wireless through my windows-xp laptop .	St
1.1.7	I have a query , can i connect to internet from my windows xp laptop with out have unplug connection and swith to other laptop .	St
1.2.1	That 's called ICS ( Internet Connection Sharing ) and it 's full of problems .	St
1.2.2	If I were you I would contact the ISP and ask what pppoe modem he recommends to use in stead of the current setup .	St
1.2.3	Then connect a wireless router ( or - even easier - use a modem/router combined ) to communicate wirelessly with both laptops .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	Look at http : //virtualrouter.codeplex.com/ ICS is too much trouble for me .	St
1.3.2	I wo n't do more than note it and move on .	St
1.4.1	My recommendation is to take the windows 7 laptop and connect the modem to the laptop and put a wireless router onto the laptop .	Sug
1.4.2	I would recommend you do this with the windows 7 laptop as it will be able to keep up with the XP laptop but not the other way around .	St
1.4.3	Next you attach the XP laptop to the win 7 laptop , the wireless router should automatically discover and configure the connection for you and you should not have to do anything .	St
