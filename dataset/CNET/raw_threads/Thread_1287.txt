And, I would like to transfer the old IDE hard drive onto the new system. However, both HD have windows XP pro running on them so I am afraid that once I add the old HD onto the new system, a crash/conflict will occur. I'm not sure where to go from here.

If Windows XP starts OK, transfer important files from the old drive to the new, and reformat the old drive to have it as free storage space.
