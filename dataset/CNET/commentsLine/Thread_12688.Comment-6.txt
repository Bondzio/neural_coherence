since you seem sure it is the ext.
hd then consider the usb 3.0 side of things.
i pretty sure that your media box and tv aren't usb 3.0 ready, it is the ext.
hd that has to supply this for usb 2.0 status.
on this regard, i think it fudges and finally winks out.
in other words, it loses the link it requires or deems necessary.
if you did *nothing* to prep the ext.
hd for use and thus accepted as is, that maybe the crux of your problem.
it may require once you eliminate everything else to allow either the media box or tv to format, or pc to format using the typical format command.
as always, i still check the specs of all devices and see where they may differ or how it stands.
so far, i don't see in the .docs how it relates to tv use, it's more geared to pc use.
afterall, even if compatible some issues still arise.
this link maybe informative:  *note* it doesn't directly say for tv use, though usb 2-3.0 is supported.
check the fine print under last table.
