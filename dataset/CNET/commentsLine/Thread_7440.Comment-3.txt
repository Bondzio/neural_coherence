if, by &quot;disk management tool.&quot;, you mean the one available through &quot;administrative tools&quot; in xp; then been there done that.
it doesn't see it.
i do have a usb 2 device and i do receive a message that it will work better in a faster port.
where thet at?????
i have 2 ports on the front and 4 on the back, i've tried other devices in all of them and get the same message for everthing.
could it be some weird thing with a driver?
one possible option would be if i could get the pci device to work right, i have one that gives me a front panel with 5 usb and 3 firewire ports.
i cannot get it to work since i had to reinstall xp, xp installed drivers and it won't update to the oem drivers.
