Bob, this idea of firmware is real new to me.
And I notice on the page the link brought me to, there are many different versions of this firmware.
Which version would I chose?
The latest, no?
And is installation simple?
This IS my last ditch effort, so I think I will try it.
And if it doesn't work, I got my new choice on newegg.com to start fresh with.
(Anyway, I am grateful I'm not losing 100s and 100s of dollars because of not keeping the box and receipt!!!)
Thanks for your patience with me.
