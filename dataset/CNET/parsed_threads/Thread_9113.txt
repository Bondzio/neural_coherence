<s> I have an ASUS A7N8X-LA that needs to be replaced. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade but don't know what would fit into my cpu case. </s>
<s> I have the Compaq Presario SR1050NX. </s>
<s> I'm want a faster processor and better graphics if possible. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Compaq.com says the motherboard is micro-ATX form factor: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00072236&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=405454&lang=en So, it's likely you need another micro-ATX motherboard to fit the case. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you upgrade, it's also likely you need a new XP license. </s>
<s> Hmmm, you're probably better off getting a new computer or building one yourself. </s>
