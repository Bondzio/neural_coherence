ram always runs at the speed of the slowest installed stick unless the memory speed is configured manually.
and if the existing ram is more than 4 years old, it may not be able to run at ddr2-800.
btw, pc2-5200 and pc2-5300 are both ddr2-667 so the existing ram should be (and will) run at ddr2-667.
there's practically no real world difference between ddr2-667 and ddr2-800 performance-wise.
