&quot;i'm planning on running a few of these in a custom enclosure.
there's such a shortage of stackable external hard drive enclosures, and i still haven't seen one that holds multiple drives, short of using a complete pc tower, and my dorm room will be really really small.
&quot; have you had any luck finding an enclosure that holds multiple drives?
