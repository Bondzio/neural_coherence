<s> I have Cincinnati Bell Wireless DSL and got a Westell Versalink 327w that is not working up to the speeds that i thought it could. </s>
<s> The gateway is currently in the kitchen hooking up to two computers, two laptops, and an xbox 360, though not all at once. </s>
<s> Usually its one xbox 360 (upstairs) and one laptop. </s>
<s> I was wondering how to increase the quality of the wireless signal because when I'm playing Xbox Live, it is always at such a low connectivity rate that im often lagging out or having to quit because its unplayable. </s>
<s> On Bungie.net it is recommended to change the QOS settings. </s>
<s> I was wondering what i should do regarding that, plus if i should enable some other things as well? </s>
<s> I'm wondering what options i should enable from the following screen on my router config screen: QOS Enable? </s>
<s> Turbo TCP Enable? </s>
<s> QOS Configuration QOS Filter Enable? </s>
<s> QOS Classification: (Best Effort (BE)Assured Forwarding 1 (AF1) Assured Forwarding 2 (AF2) Assured Forwarding 3 (AF3) Assured Forwarding 4 (AF4) Expedited Forwarding (EF) Network Control (NC)) Peak Information Rate (%): Committed Information Rate (%): Peak Burst Size (ms): Committed Burst Size (ms): Max Queue Size: Latency Measurements Latency Boundary: (Boundary 1: 0 ms Boundary 2: 10 ms Boundary 3: 20 ms Boundary 4: 40 ms Boundary 5: 100 ms Boundary 6: 1000 ms Boundary 7: 3000 ms) Latency Threshold (ms): IP Fragmentation Enable? </s>
<s> IP Fragment Size: </s>
<s> Most if not all have lax security settings so fix that. </s>
<s> Also all have out of date firmware. </s>
<s> So fix your settings (per our forum sticky) get the firmware up to date (the update button does NOT work!) </s>
<s> And if you are running P2P apps, don't ask me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I checked the sticky, but the Westell website offers no firmware updates. </s>
<s> And my security is just fine. </s>
<s> I was wondering about the QoS settings and how to use them And i'm not sure Xbox Live is p2p. </s>
<s> As to your wifi security I take it you are using our forum advice? </s>
<s> If not please share. </s>
<s> As to the firmware, the fact you didn't find it is a sign. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes I'm using the forum advice (thanks guys) and while i want to dig for it, im not sure i want to be installing firmware from a random website that isn't westell's official one </s>
<s> Since you are not sharing details, I think I can't help you here. </s>
<s> Good luck in your search but I've worked the 327w many times. </s>
<s> I had hoped I could pitch in but you are not sharing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am very confused right now. </s>
<s> What information would you like? </s>
<s> I will be happy to give you anything you need to help, i'm really not trying to be a pain. </s>
<s> D90-327W61-06 </s>
<s> Here's what I know. </s>
<s> You have the 327w, version 6. </s>
<s> &quot;D90-327W61-06&quot; Which is one Westell has not leaked a firmware update. </s>
<s> I have no indication you have followed our suggested settings so I'll just reiterate that. </s>
<s> The forum note/sticky is exactly what I found to work very well on all the 327w's I've run into. </s>
<s> If you don't use those settings, PLEASE share what they are since it matters. </s>
<s> The other settings have never paid off so I'll write to use the stock values. </s>
<s> You can try DRTCP from http://www.dslreports.com/drtcp but after too many trials I have returned to what we have in the forum note and stock settings. </s>
<s> If you are using WEP then you are repeating an issue I run into a lock. </s>
<s> If you have hidden SSID, then you are repeating another issue. </s>
<s> -&gt; I'm going to be blunt here. </s>
<s> If you don't share, I can't share other than to repeat the forum sticky without noting why we do that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> was configure the QoS settings to allow XBox Live to be prioritized but thanks anyway. </s>
<s> i'll just call my ISP </s>
<s> I've worked on many 327w's and stock the xbox live is fine, UNLESS we find the owner with WEP, disabled SSID, etc... Bob </s>
<s> Your dead wrong there. </s>
<s> All details were shared. </s>
<s> Numerous times in fact. </s>
<s> But your too stubborn to listen. </s>
<s> You probably thought you had my problem pre-solved. </s>
<s> Sorry buddy can't be right all the time! </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, it was a simple issue of enable port fowarding to s pre-defined service under the router settings. </s>
<s> This helps with XBox Live speed. </s>
<s> Also after calling my ISP for actual help, they realized that our DSL modem was not up to speed and have them send a technician out to fix that problem. </s>
<s> But thanks for your senseless paranoia about me &quot;hiding&quot; things from you like i actually had something to hide </s>
<s> It was never the settings you were asking about. </s>
<s> It's a shame you feel slighted by someone that offered to share prior experiences. </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm just a grizzled well seasoned embedded hardware and software type. </s>
<s> I can see why that could annoy you that I want to work my list first. </s>
<s> Too bad you misdirected the discussion with talk of QOS which it never was an issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> all of this could have been avoided by you explaining yourself and saying what your thoughts were rather than talking to me like im retarded? </s>
<s> Just simply stating that you believed QoS was not the thing i should be looking at? </s>
<s> Thats all you had to do? </s>
<s> Please never go into customer support or anything having to do with PR </s>
<s> I am more than willing to go over the usual areas and help people set these up. </s>
<s> This is not tech support so I have no qualms or reservations as to PR or such here. </s>
<s> It's up to everyone to get along and work the issues. </s>
<s> It was never QOS and has never been in many years of my helping setup these things. </s>
<s> Again your choice on direction and keep in mind this is not tech support. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
