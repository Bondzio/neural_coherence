I have not had any success getting a constant signal with my wireless router in our 3-storey house and am considering Lynksys' Powerline products, namely the PLE200.
This allows me to run my broadband connection through the house wiring.
Lynksys is just re-releasing this product, in an upgraded version, and I'm wondering if anyone out there has has any good or bad experiences with this type of networking.
