hey everyone, i am planning to buy a new external harddrive for everyday use like movies, music,pictures etc.
i will be connecting it to my xbox mostly to watch movies.
now i had western digital elements 1tb and it only lasted for a year.
there are two types that am confused between the portable ones (which are smaller in size) and regular big ones.
if you guys could tell me if there is any other difference than the obvious size difference?
i know portable cost just a bit more.
but is there any speed difference.
also does big ones last longer than portables?
also which one you guys recommend?
i was looking to buy for under $150.
size 500 gb - 1 tb.
thanks
