I have successfully intalled the driver and card and actually had a secure connection to my network. however after updating to SP2 for XP I have been unable to gain access to my network. I have tried the 'Hotfix&quot; issue as well as reinstall the product, manually configure and several frimware updates and have gotten nowhere. I had not problems on initial install - only after SP2 - any help in getting around this - also will I find this to be the case with all WiFi cards and SP2??? I guess that I should say my issue is that it cannot find IP address - then if I manually configure it will find it but will not allow the connection. Any hell??

When I turn the laptop back on I have problem getting the driver to &quot;initiate&quot; so if I turn on the windows utility it sends me to the netgear utility - which then works??? wierd

5198	4	64994	773514	772051	rcarmich	2/18/05 8:57 AM	1.10871702E12	That did it -	After trying several configs and reinstalls I finally got one of the newer driver updates to work - not sure why this one did not work the first time I tried it though...Thanks for the help
