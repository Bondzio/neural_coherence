i've been reading a lot and there is a lot of discussion about what power supply is required to power various components.
can somebody tell me whether the power supply draws power at its rated wattage or whether that is just the maximum and the power used depends on the components.
for example, if you have a case that comes supplied with a 430w psu, but you only need (say) a 300w supply to power your components, will you be using more electricity than if you got a 300w psu, or just the same?
