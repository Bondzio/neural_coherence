<s> Yes, there will probably be plenty of things that make me sound like an idiot in this post, but here goes. </s>
<s> I'm upgrading my pathetic little Radeon 5450 to something that can actually play the games released in the last year. </s>
<s> As of now, I'm having trouble deciding between the 6850 and the 6870. </s>
<s> My first inclination was towards the 6850 - I'd be getting it for $50 less, and according to the benchmark site I'd been going to ( http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html ) there was a tiny difference between the cards. </s>
<s> However, for the last 20 minutes, I've been looking on newegg at customer reviews, and there seems to be quite a difference. </s>
<s> The 6850 seemed to have some who were very impressed with the capabilities of the card, but there were those that had things run well, just not on maximum settings. </s>
<s> The 6870, on the other hand, had either glowing reviews or hardware failure issues (which, for the record, was occasionally a problem with the 6850). </s>
<s> So, I'm clueless. </s>
<s> Does the benchmark site mean anything? </s>
<s> Am I better off going on word of mouth than a fancy list of numbers? </s>
<s> Or is that the truth, and I just happened to look at reviews that are swaying me in the wrong direction? </s>
<s> It's too close to call but most hardware failures I've seen are due to heat issues caused by poor case ventilation. </s>
<s> After that it's the choice of power supplies. </s>
<s> And let's also mention the old BAD CAPS plague. </s>
<s> I would pick either but whichever one is the best price. </s>
