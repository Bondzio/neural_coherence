<s> I want to view and record my current tv lineup to my pc. </s>
<s> I have a cable box from my cable company (astound). </s>
<s> Will it go through the cable box for one channel viewing-recording or is there a way to bypass the cable box for simultaneously viewing and recording on the pc like a dvr does? </s>
<s> I have expanded basic cable programing. </s>
<s> Also, what would be better: a usb tuner or internal tv tuner card and whats a good one for under $100.00. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Most of the cable TV (but not all) available on channels 2-125 will still be viewable on the TV tuner cards. </s>
<s> HD may or may not be available. </s>
<s> You would need to check with your provider if they offer clear-QAM channels. </s>
<s> If you do not know what that means, see here for a discussion: http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/248819 Or Google for various clarification. </s>
<s> Once you find out what is available, then start shopping. </s>
<s> Many like the Hauppauge devices, see here: http://www.hauppauge.com/ But you are free to explore other brands. </s>
<s> would the &quot;hauppauge&quot; hd pvr do what I what? </s>
<s> But it costs more than $100 you mentioned See here: http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html If you are not as concerned with HD recording, then the WinTV-PVR line is quite popular. </s>
<s> There are four choices of that line or there are WinTV-HVR which add Clear QAM channels along with the SD channels. </s>
<s> The HD PVR ( Hauppauge 1212 ) is the most all round capable choice as long as the inputs fit your needs. </s>
<s> It looks like you have to use component inputs for HD recording. </s>
<s> It has pass thru so you can intercept the signal from the STB, then on to your TV without any other changes in the connections. </s>
<s> go for the ati wonder tv card. </s>
<s> It has the highest ratings of any tuner cards out there. </s>
