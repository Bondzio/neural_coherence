Hi!
everyone, i would like some help with a new motherboard.
Specs its a FOXCONN P4M8907MB-2.0-RS2H, VIA P4M890+VT823ZA, SOCKET 775, FSB 1066/800/533MHz, PCIex 16, DDR2 533/400.
The ATX power connector is 24 pin how many voltage would this board need?
Well the problem is this i &quot;connected everthing, when i power it up there is this long long noise, the CPU fan runs but no display.
When i take out the ATX 12V power Connector the noise stops the CPU funs but no display, i tried changing the memory still no solution&quot;.
Any help i appreciate.
