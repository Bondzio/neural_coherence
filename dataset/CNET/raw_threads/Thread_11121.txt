9563	0	525980	5127346	NR	idrbooks	5/6/11 12:28 AM	1.30464168E12	teac mice	I have some mobility problems and I can buy the necessary items only on the Web. I use a nice Teac OX1200 mouse on my office computer and I tried to find similar mouse for my house computer but I cannot find the same model. Several online shops offer Teac mouse of different models but without enough data to decide if they are what I need. Is there any Teac catalog with data on the various models of Teac mice? I could not find such on the Web. Please advise Thanks

It is a &quot;Non-English&quot; web site. When I Googled Teac OX1200 mouse I found a lot of non-english web sites, mainly Russian, but also some Israeli. I also found a lot of other sites which my browser security add-on WOT, (Web of Trust), told me were suspect. I used Google {Translate} to translate an Israeli web site and found this; http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.zap.co.il/model.aspx%3Fmodelid%3D690744&amp;ei=rbLDTennC-TV4wba8_2kBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ7gEwAw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DTeac%2BOX1200%2Bmouse%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1087%26bih%3D845%26prmd%3Divns Shorter version of that link, Zap.co.il . That site seems to have these mouses for sale. Mark

I am lookin for a catalog from Teac with details of the various models. For the time being - to no avail. Thanks anyway Yochanan
