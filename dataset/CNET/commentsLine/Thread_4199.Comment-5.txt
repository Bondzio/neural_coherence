what does os and dx mean????
i have tried to update with ms but to no avail.i`m in need of some major help.
when i installed it the process said i should use the ltp1 port is that right?
or should i have it set for something else.i`ve never rebooted a system before and didn`t look at all the settings for stuff before we cleaned everything off.i`m at a loss as to why it was ok and now it`s a slow as the preverbial snail!
