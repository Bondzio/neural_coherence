windows only offers support for printers in a local area network, not between peers across the internet, i'm afraid.
even if there was, you wouldn't be able to get the results (the prints) without visiting the office, of course, so - realistically speaking - only the next day.
and if you run out of paper, it stops printing.
i think it's best to buy a second printer for home use.
the main cost of printing is the ink, and for that it makes no difference where you print.
