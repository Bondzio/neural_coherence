ok, i originally got the error 0x0000009c(0x0000004,0x80545ff0,0b2000000,0x00070f0f) and researched that error.
i changed out the ram from 1gig to 512megs, and it seems to run good for basic stuff like web browsing.
however if i try to start up a game it either crashes or gives me a bunch of color on the screen.
i started up both sim city 4 and the original neverwinter nights.
the machine is has an athlon 64, geforce 6600gt, 200gb sata hd, on a asrock motherboard.
any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.
