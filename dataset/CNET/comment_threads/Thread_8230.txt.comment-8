Thanks again Steven.
Everything there compares to my other machine, but I changed the settings around, but to no avail.
However, your post got me to thinking that maybe some other software is messing with things.
I am using &quot;XP Smoker&quot;, so I am going to do an uninstall there and see what happens.
Have a good one.
Ken
