<s> My keyboard doesn't work. </s>
<s> Or, more accurately, my keyboard works only before Windows loads (i.e. </s>
<s> it works to get into the BIOS, it works to navigate in the BIOS, it works if I use a boot disk to load DOS, etc). </s>
<s> Once Windows XP loads, I have no keyboard functionality. </s>
<s> I've gone into device mangaer several times to uninstall and re-install the drivers, both in Safe Mode and regular mode. </s>
<s> No go. </s>
<s> I've tried deleting the drivers and replacing them with &quot;fresh&quot; copies from the XP cd. </s>
<s> No go. </s>
<s> I've run Windows update. </s>
<s> No go. </s>
<s> I've updated the drivers for my other hardware. </s>
<s> No go. </s>
<s> I've even tried to do a repair installation of XP with the cd. </s>
<s> Let me tell you, entering your product key when you have no keyboard really sucks. </s>
<s> And it still didn't work afterwards. </s>
<s> It's not the keyboard, because it works on other computers. </s>
<s> It's not the port, because it works as long as windows isn't running. </s>
<s> It's a PS/2 keyboard, and I haven't yet tried a USB keyboard, I'm looking for a friend who has one that I can borrow. </s>
<s> Any ideas from anyone? </s>
<s> I've hit a wall. </s>
<s> I don't know what else to try. </s>

<s> I ran into this with a LOGITECH KEYBOARD DRIVER. </s>
<s> The driver was flawed and to LOGITECH's discredit the method to fix it keeps moving on their web site. </s>
<s> It's a common issue that keeps coming back to some that ... install keyboard enhancers. </s>

<s> I probably shoud have said this in the first post, but it is a Logitech keyboard and driver that I'm working with. </s>
<s> Any idea where to find the solution (or what to look for) on Logitech's website? </s>
<s> I was on there once already, but it was just a cursory search because I didn't expect to find anything. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip! </s>

<s> Here's one removal page from Logitech. </s>

<s> Thanks for the article. </s>
<s> I'm going to email Logitech and see if they can give me the URL for the keyboard version of that page. </s>
<s> This worked great for getting rid of the MouseWare program, but I need the iTouch program installed. </s>
<s> This is probably the closest I've come to a solution, after working on this problem for over a week and taking about it on three discussion boards. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> It goes to show that sometimes personal experience can win out over pure, unadulterated knowledge. </s>
