1.1.1	Hello , I 'm wondering what some of you would do in this situation ... Ok I need a new Graphics Card and I was about ready to buy a Radeon 9800Pro for $ 200 from MSI , but the new GeForce 6800 ( not ultra and not GT just 6800 ) costs $ 275 and will outperform that 9800pro but 2x in most cases .	St
1.1.2	Now would you either buy that 9800Pro or would you save that extra $ 75 and go for that 6800 from eVGA ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	This is one of those areas that you have to look at your application .	St
1.2.2	A gamer may opt for that lastest card .	St

1.3.1	ok , well for me the application is games , but I also want it to last for at least 14 months , so that is the agrguement in favor for the 6800 , it supports all of the latest technologies , and its faster .	St
1.3.2	But the 9800Pro still can come in costing less and performing very well at various games .	St
1.3.3	Do you think that the GeForce 6800 in 14 months will be the same as a GeForce FX 5800 is today , still performing great but basicly phased out ?	Ques
1.3.4	any ideas on how long it should be considered top range ?	Ques
1.3.5	( I ask that because I do n't want to be buying a new $ 200-300 part every 8 months )	St
1.4.1	Did your last card last 14 months ?	Ques
1.4.2	If not , why did n't you get that much out of it ?	Ques
1.4.3	As to the card being the top of the range , once you get near the top , the top position can be a tenuous thing since a better video driver could cause the number 2 card to move ahead .	St
1.4.4	If you are in the top 10 , then you can run any game offered today .	St
