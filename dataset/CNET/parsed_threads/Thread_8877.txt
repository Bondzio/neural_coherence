<s> I have a home wireless network with a linksys router and network card that runs on the 11b technology. </s>
<s> I'm having no problems getting connection on a computer two floors below. </s>
<s> My girlfriend's father wanted me to set up a wirless network in his house. </s>
<s> He bought a Motorola router and card that has the 11g technology. </s>
<s> The computer he is trying to connect with is only 1 floor below but it's barely getting a signal and has trouble connecting to the internet. </s>
<s> The router and computer are on opposite ends of the house but I would still expect to get a better signal than what it's been getting. </s>
<s> They are probably only about 40-50ft away from each other. </s>
<s> Isn't the g technology supposed to give a better range than b? </s>
<s> I don't understand why it's having such a hard time connecting. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You may want to try moving the wireless device closer to the router and note what effect that has. </s>
<s> Some homes have construction materials which can effect wireless transmissions in addition to other wireless devices working in the same frequency range. </s>
<s> Be sure that all FIRMWARE and drivers are uptodate. </s>
<s> Just last week was another reminder that new out of the box components are being sent to us with almost non-functional firmware or drivers. </s>
<s> You get to update such. </s>
