Hi RP, Resetting the network password/security key was costly and time consuming.
I had to pay some guy from India (Linksys) 30 bucks to walk me through it.
I do not remember how to do it.
Is it easier than I remember, or do you know how to do it in such a way that I would not have to revist Mumbai?
