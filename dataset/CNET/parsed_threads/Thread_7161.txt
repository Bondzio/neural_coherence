<s> Hello there. </s>
<s> Let me first say that I'm not really a gamer, or know too much about what I have....but I do know that it isn't too shabby. </s>
<s> My friend was selling his older Alienware (I think it's a 2000 and I think the color is Martian Red) for only $200, and I may not know much, but I do know that is a hell of a deal....since it ran doom3 and half life flawlessly with all the settings maxed. </s>
<s> The 2nd best card on the market at the time was installed, a Radeon 700 something, and there is an audigy sound card on the front, and I think my friend upgraded the hard drive to 200 gigs...not sure if that is stock though. </s>
<s> He may have done more to it, but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> First, I've had for over a year and it has just been sitting under my desk not working. </s>
<s> What I think happened was one of the fans stopped working, since it got really hot right before it stopped....which I was told is ok...but I don't see how it is now I think about it. </s>
<s> It basically starts to boot, then gets to a blue screen...which i imagine is the desktop color but I don't remember now...and then restarts again in a continous loop. </s>
<s> I've been told by a couple people that it is the power core, or center, or something and that it's a cheap fix....like $30. </s>
<s> You would think with a piece of technology so advanced, that if a fan quit...it wouldn't ruin the whole thing, and something inexpensive would break to save your comp....If not, what could this be and how do I fix it? </s>
<s> Secondly, how do I check what year it is and what the specs are? </s>
<s> (what are the specs on an '00 anyway?) </s>
<s> Finally, what can I get for it when I sell it? </s>
<s> I thank you all for being kind and helping me. </s>
<s> If you all have any guitar related questions....I'm all ears Jeff Daughtridge </s>
<s> From the year 2000? </s>
<s> Don't walk away from the deal, RUN!!! </s>
<s> You can get new COMPLETE SYSTEMS for about $250-$300 these days. </s>
<s> A nonfunctioning fan can mean many things, incluting a bad motherboard, PSU, or it could be just a broken fan. </s>
<s> If the CPU or PSU fan doesn't work, that is a MAJOR PROBLEM. </s>
<s> Can't tell without testing. </s>
<s> No one can tell you anthing about what you could get for it if yo don't give detailed specs. </s>
<s> The following free utilities will help you get hardware specs. </s>
<s> Also tell us the OS. </s>
<s> Belarc Advisor Everest Home Edition PC Wizard CPU-Z SANDRA Lite Aside: Any Windows computer without the Windows XP installation CD and valid Product Key is completely useless in the long run...unless you make it a Linux machine. </s>
<s> ...I have owned the comp for over a year. </s>
<s> The radeon card was worth i think he said like $400-$500 new, and the audigy card is im gonna guess worth at least $100. </s>
<s> The comp worked for about 2 weeks while i owned it; worked great too. </s>
<s> The fan was on the sliding door that went out. </s>
<s> Also, I THINK that it is a 2000, b/c it isnt shaped like the ones of today....I wish i knew more on the subject really. </s>
<s> Who cares what the case looks like. </s>
<s> What's in it? </s>
<s> We need to know model names. </s>
<s> CPU (CPU-Z) motherboard (system board) model number (CPU-Z) Memory (RAM) amount and type (CPU-Z) Hard drive(s) CD/DVD drive Video card model Which Audigy soundcard (there are many) Look on the back of the computer for Power Supply Unit maximum Wattage and manufacturer (model number if there). </s>
<s> Does this include keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor? </s>
<s> What monitor? </s>
<s> What speakers? </s>
<s> Hello, We are going to need some basic information. </s>
<s> The first place to start is what motherboard do you have? </s>
<s> Take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard. </s>
<s> It will be something like ASUS A7N8X. </s>
<s> Next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans. </s>
<s> Are they all spinning? </s>
<s> Are they clear? </s>
<s> Not all clogged up with dust? </s>
<s> The main fans to look at are the CPU fan & the Power Supply Fan. </s>
<s> Note everything & give us as many details as possible. </s>
