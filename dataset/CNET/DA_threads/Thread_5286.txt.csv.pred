1.1.1	Good luck with it all ... ..I just got a eeePC1005PEG for Christmas and within 36 hours of start up , the hard drive crashed & got blue screen with WIN7 .	St
1.1.2	After 2 hours of ( non ) conversation -- -- -they can only read from a card , I got an RMA but will have to foot the cost of return which is 10 % of what the thing cost .	St
1.1.3	He insinuated that I abused the commputer ( there are 7 laptops in my living room right now -- 3 Dell , 2 HP , 1 Toshiba , & a Mac and 4 desktops -- -I know how to use a computer ) .	St
1.1.4	Could n't get any company address for BBB complaints , the 'customer service ' guy could n't speak English or understand the spelling of my name , etc , would n't give his name or employee number so I could send a formal complaint .	Sug
1.1.5	Now that I 've done a Google search , I 'm sorry I bought ASUS -- -- your problems have just begun ... ..they will hang up on you , lose your laptop , say they are waiting for parts , claim you damaged it before you returned it , abused it , offer a lesser replacement , etc .	St
1.1.6	I understand that parts have defects , but the distinct and universal lack of service is a problem .	St
1.1.7	Fortunately , the on-line store I bought it from will take it back , without questions & will pay for returning it & will refund my money !	St
1.1.8	I WILL buy from them again .	St
1.1.9	Good luck ! .	Polite
1.2.1	This has undoubtedly been the worst customer service experience of my life .	St
1.2.2	I purchased an Asus netbook in May 2010 ; this post will be a very brief summary of unbelievably poor service .	St
1.2.3	Shortly purchasing the Asus netbook , it died .	St
1.2.4	After several long and frustrating calls ; their service techs told us it was a battery issue and sent a new one , which took way too long .	St
1.2.5	That did not solve the problem as the unit remained dead , and after many more calls , we shipped the unit back to Asus for repair .	St
1.2.6	Weeks later it was sent back to us with a new battery charger .	St
1.2.7	We used the unit for a week , went to re-charge the battery , and found Asus had sent us the wrong charger .	St
1.2.8	After a couple of more calls , I requested from a supervisor that a new charger be shipped to me overnight mail ; he told me we needed to send him the charger and then they would send us a new one , and not overnight .	St
1.2.9	I refused to do this and demanded an overnight shipment given the complete inconvenience Asus was causing me and the fact that I was about to travel and wanted to take it with me .	St
1.2.10	He told me he would make the request and that we would receive a call that night to confirm the overnight shipping .	St
1.2.11	We never got the call , and I have called their service line three more times , having been disconnected , then put on hold for over 30 minutes .	St
1.2.12	Right now I 've been on hold for another 30 minutes waiting to talk to yet another supervisor to get the adapter overnighted to me .	St
1.2.13	Worst of all , we have been without a working netbook for 5 of the 7 months since I purchased it , and their customer service has been horrendous .	St
1.2.14	I could never consider another Asus product or recommend Asus to anyone , and am , in fact , thinking of posting this story on as many consumer open forum and message boards as possible .	St
1.2.15	I can not imagine how Asus allows this level of service to exist .	St
1.2.16	All they do is throw standard answers at you , followed by bureaucratic process .	St
1.2.17	If you 're reading this , do yourself a favor and avoid Asus at all costs .	St
1.3.1	I 've posted my story to several sites , but let me know where you post & I 'll do the same .	St
1.3.2	Thanks ... ... ... ... ... ... ..c	Polite
1.4.1	So far just with CNET and Consumer Reports , but would love to post it to more sites .	St
1.4.2	Let me know where you 've done so and I 'll be happy to post mine .	St
1.4.3	I 've never done this before , but they so infuriated me that I feel an absolute need to do so .	St
1.4.4	The latest was that I waited for 90 minutes on the phone three days ago for yet another supervisor , then when I was n't getting anywhere ( they told me they 'd have one call me back ) , I asked to speak to the call center manager or director , so they decided to hang up on me .	St
1.4.5	And , no surprise , three days later , still no return call and still no power adapter , so I still have a dead netbook .	St
1.4.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.7	Steve	St
1.5.1	But most folk lose a battery or adapter when they send those to service when not asked to .	St
1.5.2	If you include such , it is usually gone forever even with other makers so the lesson is to not send anything they do n't ask for .	St
1.5.3	Order a new adapter so you can use the product .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	Bob , Thanks for your message , but Asus told us that we needed to send everything back to them .	St
1.6.2	Did n't sound logical to me , but they insisted .	St
1.6.3	The frustrating thing beyond this incredibly poor customer service situation is that all they needed to do was spend $ 20 to overnight the adapter to me , but their internal bureaucracy has prevented that simple solution from taking place .	St
1.6.4	Steve	St
1.7.1	I 've found them to rarely overnight items unless I pay .	St
1.7.2	Now there was this fellow that demanded that and ended up on the wrong side of someone 's feelings in a repair depot .	St
1.7.3	If we do n't burn our bridges sometimes we get what we need but not what we wanted .	St
1.7.4	Sorry to read this story but service is hitting all time lows from my view .	St
1.7.5	Even Apple blows it from time to time .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
