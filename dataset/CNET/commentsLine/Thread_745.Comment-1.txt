i have always had cable with something like a linksys router with built in firewall.
i just bought a verizon hotspot samsung sch-lc11 to use at a house that i will retire to in the future because it has no cable.
the hotspot has no firewall, of course i have windows firewall on my computers.
what i want to know is how good is this to have without a hardware firewall and is there something i should do?
also i bought a wifiranger from 3gstore dot com to use with the hotspot so i can run ethernet cable to my computers.
the wifiranger is a router but has no built in hardware firewall but does a router not help by the way it works to make like a firewall in a sense?
looking for advice and just to learn more about the setup i will be using.
thanks sly
