1. annoying.
2. for bragging rights.
3. great if you run a 64-bit os (most of us will use 32-bit windows) 4. results in calls to the maker asking why all the ram doesn't show.
there is so little payoff past 2gb that unless it's free i stop at 2gb.
the basic machine i'd like to see is any core 2 duo (ghz is what you want to pay for or not), 2gb ram, some 3d card, etc.
hp should have a very nice quad core at your price.
that would be the no-brainer selection.
just do that.
