<s> I have a MSI P6N SLI-FI board and a P4 650 CPU installed. </s>
<s> The BIOS shows a default vcore of 1.23. </s>
<s> I also have a system with a Asus P5ND2-SLI and a P4 630 installed. </s>
<s> The default vcore for it is 1.39. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to raise the vcore of the MSI system to 1.36 - 1.39, it hangs at POST during morning start-up after having been off overnight. </s>
<s> It won't load. </s>
<s> BIOS won't even display. </s>
<s> My question is: is it normal for the vcore to be different on different boards? </s>
<s> I would figure a particular CPU would create a default vcore value consistent through all brands and models of boards. </s>
