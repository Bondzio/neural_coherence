i have used the magicjack for a year & just renewed it for 5 years.
it's performance depends a lot on the quality of your isp.
you must have dsl or another kind of high speed connection.
you must leave your computer on to receive calls.
when your computer automatically updates & reboots itself, you may get an error msg saying &quot;broken storage&quot;.
this will require you to reformat the drive that mj is on.
when you do this, you lose your stored contact list.
other than these glitches, it works very well & has saved me lots of money.
