the first one is about picking a wattage size.
the second reveals that too many units &quot;fib&quot; about the number.
lesson?
just get the big one.
troubleshoot?
you can try reducing the load.
are there more than one hard disk?
can you unplug the cd/dvd drives?
what else can go?
and the non-negotiable item.
latest bios.
some won't do this either because they think a new board would have the latest (ring the jeopardy buzzer please...) or they are afraid.
in closing, without spare parts, there is no certain way to find the dead/undersized or such part.
the pc design isn't including diagnostics.
