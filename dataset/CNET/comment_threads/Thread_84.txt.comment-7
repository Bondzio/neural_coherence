after I make new partition what do I do, I trie to format from dos but couldnt so I used win 98 cd because I do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig's.
btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct?
