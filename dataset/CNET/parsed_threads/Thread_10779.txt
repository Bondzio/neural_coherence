<s> I bought an ATI RADEON 9600 pro recently. </s>
<s> I have tried to install it, but I cannot install anything from the installation cd. </s>
<s> Every time I do, the screen goes to energy saving mode, and my tower freezes up. </s>
<s> I have installed it in an e-machines t-3302 with an AMD Sempron processor. </s>
<s> It runs at 2GHZ.I have 512 MB RAM installed. </s>
<s> The card is installed in the AGP slot. </s>
<s> Is there anything that I am missing? </s>
<s> If so, did you turn it off in the BIOS? </s>
<s> Or, if you had a previous card, did you remove it in Device Manager, and uninstall any software associated with it? </s>
<s> Assuming you did these, here's another thing. </s>
<s> Some hardware drivers do that. </s>
<s> When you put in the disc, don't let it &quot;Auto-run&quot;. </s>
<s> Open it manually and install from there. </s>
<s> That's happened to me more than once. </s>
<s> May take more than one try to get it right. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
