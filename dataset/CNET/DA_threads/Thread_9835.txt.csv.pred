1.2.7	Your system may have suffered a system error recently or a key DLL , etc is simply gone .	St
1.2.8	Have you checked your BIOS to determine if your optical drive is configured and recognized properly ?	Ques
1.2.9	Make sure your IDE or SATA cabling is correct along with the jumpers on your optical drive .	Res
1.2.10	With PnP , your Windows OS should read the drive without the use of drivers other than the drivers that Windows provides .	St
1.2.11	You could check the manufacturers website for new firmware for your drive .	Sug
1.2.12	Or your drive simply does n't function any longer and needs to be replaced .	St
1.2.13	Replace it with a PnP and bios compatible OS .	St
1.2.14	It should be recognized and configured without you installing a driver .	St
1.2.15	Make sure your jumpers and cabling are also correct .	Res
1.2.16	Windows does have a recovery console embedded on the XP CD .	St
1.2.17	From there , you can type in commands like DOS , to troubleshoot .	St

1.2.23	If its a common XP Professional or Home Wins32 message , your system should boot successfully with those files .	St
1.2.24	If not , its specific and tougher to fix that way .	St
1.2.25	Maybe you should go into safe mode and system restore to an earlier time or use a third party software like ERD that has Windows directories and other utilities .	St

1.3.1	& quot ; Replace it with a PnP and bios compatible OS. & quot ; I meant a PnP BIOS compatible CD drive ; most are these days .	St

1.3.3	Double click onto the C : icon and use your menu bar with the folders option to un-check the option for hidden system files .	St
1.3.4	To find windows32 , double click onto your C : drive and click into Windows , then find the Wins32 folder .	St
1.4.1	a corrupted registry can prevent booting but does not necessarily mean your hard drive is bad .	St
