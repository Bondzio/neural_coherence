<s> Hello guys...I am looking for a NIC driver for my presario 8000 I looked under HP website support pages and there seems to be no specific driver for the ethernet controller. </s>
<s> Any ideas guys? </s>
<s> The 8000 is a series so you should be more specific. </s>
<s> Also, it may be OS specific. </s>
<s> In closing, where are the restore CDs? </s>
