hello, i'm new to cnet, and desperate for some help.
i have just bought a new tower with a m7ncg 400 motherboard with onboard sound.
it uses nvidia nforce audio ... i installed the drivers that came with the chipset cd and the device shows up in the control panel (im using win xp pro btw) under &quot;sound and audio devices&quot; and in the device manager, displayed that the device is working properly.
everything seems fine, i can adjust volume and whatnot, but there is no sound coming from my speakers, except for a strange buzzing sound when i move my mouse.
it's soft, and can only be heard if i have the speakers turned up significantly loud.
everytime i move my mouse it's like i can hear it as a buzz... anyways, can anyone help?
i would be very grateful i don't know what to do and i really need sound thanks a lot
