1.2.1	I assume you did check: - that this motherboard supports this processor - that it's the right kind of RAM (memory advisor at crucial.com) - that it has the right slot for this video card Then all will be fine.	St
1.2.2	Kees	St
1.3.1	power supply (PSU), monitor, operating system (OS).	St
1.3.2	PS...If you're setting up your system with 4GBs RAM....get a kit with 2 - 2GB DIMMs.	St
1.3.3	That MB has 4 DIMM slots and where possible you should install DIMMs in PAIRs....matched DIMMs ... 2@2, 2@4, 2@8, etc., VAPCMD	St
