as a previous poster mention, a dedicated video-card with take a load-off the main cpu and runs on a different buss, so that will make a big difference.
install the fastest and largest amount of ram you can.
note: there are limitations based on your motherboard, which version of windows your using.
microsoft has a chart on their site.
if at all possible go for 4-gigs with any version of xp (although your machine won't see it all) and always go for the fastest speed your motherboard supports.
vista based machines (and versions) supports all sorts of memory configs.
you'll have to check into that.
if you have old cranky-hard drives, consider new drives with as much 'cache' as possible and then look at faster drives (7,200rpm vs 10,000rpm) but, that costs a lot.
be sure to configure your windows to make the most of the &quot;paging file&quot; properties, as this will keep required, bit-maps and shading information loaded as its' required.
hope this helps..?
