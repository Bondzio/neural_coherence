<s> It's pretty difficult right now to decide if to go with either the FX 57 or the XP 4800. </s>
<s> On one hand the FX 57 blows the XP 4800 when it comes to gaming(single application) but on the other pretty soon games will start taking advantage of the Dual Core. </s>
<s> For gamers like me the bottom line is, Frames Per Second, but if the games start taking advantage of dual core procesors I presume that then the single cores will run them a lot slower. </s>
<s> The question is, at this time, what's better? </s>
<s> Will the gaming industry start taking advantage of the dual core soon, or will it take another year or two? </s>
<s> Is it better to buy the XP 4800 and wait for the games to come out, or get the FX 57 and possibly have to replace it in one year? </s>
<s> Is the difference in performance large enough to choose the FX 57? </s>
<s> Hey, you got a spare grand laying around, I'd wait. </s>
<s> As FX-60 is coming out soon, Januaryish, as is the higher X2's. </s>
<s> All, in all: The FX-57 will almost always win with the games, AT THE MOMENT. </s>
<s> I assume multi-threaded games will be out, or at least a few before the of 2006. </s>
<s> I've been browing around AMDZONE and they are saying that an overclocked X2 could easily be better than their single-core counterparts. </s>
<s> Again, I'd wait in January for the new processors..... Look for some benchmarks then, and take your pick. </s>
<s> You may need a few more dollars though, as they are saying the price may be over 1k. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> the FX-57 is better for gaming. </s>
<s> The X2 is for multi-tasking purposes, but don't get me wrong the X2 is good for gaming; the 57 is better. </s>
<s> the FX-57 is a great processor made by AMD, and i would say if your into gaming, to go with the FX. </s>
<s> AMD uses its power more efficiently and if you go with dual core, well thats just awesome! </s>
<s> the only problem with double core is the price... i saw places running the FX-57 up to $2000, but its an investment, and i suggest you do some research on some processors... you never know what new chips will come into play. </s>
<s> For now yes the 57 dominatesm but the 4800+ can help you alot more with running multiple applications. </s>
<s> Companies are going to take advantage of dual core processors. </s>
<s> Also as said in a previous post, in lines of processors are coming out, which most liely means price break for you. </s>
<s> So I suggest you wait. </s>
<s> Although the 57 will get you more fps, the 4800 still has far more useful value. </s>
<s> My bad. </s>
<s> I suck at typing and am very slow at it. </s>
<s> I always look at the keyboard and not the screen, so I never spellcheck. </s>

<s> what other sites besides this one do you guys use to get news and adivce? </s>
<s> i'm looking to buy a PC this week but the wait till Jan talk is further stressing me out </s>
<s> I've decidedto go with single core. </s>
<s> Since my main purpose is gaming and all arrows point out that the FX is a better choice for gaming, at least for the time being and for the next year. </s>
<s> Now...anyone knows when the FX-60 is coming out? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> CNET, of course; AMDZONE, Tom's Hardware, just some general browsing of a product will reveal sites specific to that product. </s>
<s> What kind of PC, and budget, are you looking for? </s>
