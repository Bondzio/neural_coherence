1.1.1	Purchased a DVI cable from Newegg back in August 2006 for my NEC Multisync flat panel monitor , which worked fine .	St
1.1.2	Recently , I had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house .	St
1.1.3	Now , I go to put everything back together and , low and behold , the DVI cable is missing .	St
1.1.4	As best as I can recall , my monitor has a female port ( in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable I purchase ) .	St
1.1.5	I 'd buy the same one , but it 's been so long , Newegg does n't carry it anymore .	St
1.1.6	Does it matter which DVI cable I purchase ?	Ques
1.1.7	What should I be looking for ?	Ques
1.1.8	Any suggestions on where/what to look at ?	Ques
1.1.9	I 'm looking to resolve this ASAP as I have no computer access while this issue lingers .	St
