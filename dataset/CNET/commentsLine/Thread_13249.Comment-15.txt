regardless of whether the printer is shared (connected directly to a computer) or networked (connected directly to a switch, router, wap, etc.
), the problem is usually a personal firewall issue (software on each computer).
the firewalls need to permit the ip addresses of all computers, printers, and other devices that need talk to one another.
the problem is that many don't even know that a firewall is running on their computers; and if they do know one is running, they have no idea that the firewall needs to be configured to permit such communication.
some newer firewalls autodetect the range of ip addresses of the local network and permit those by default.
other firewalls have to be told what specific ip addresses or range of ip addresses are permitted or to be trusted.
* * * * * the computer that hosts a shared printer doesn't care (or even know) how other computers connect (wired or wireless) to the the network.
also, it doesn't matter if the printer is connected via parallel, usb, or other method.
