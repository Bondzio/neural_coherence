<s> What is the best Modem/Router combo? </s>
<s> I don't want to &quot;rent&quot; the current modem ($7.00 per month) I have from Comcast. </s>
<s> I want to 1. stream internet TV from the router and 2. use my laptop wirelessly for browsing the internet. </s>
<s> I have Comcast cable internet with 20/5 service. </s>
<s> Thanks for any info! </s>
<s> Do not fall for &quot;best&quot; or that &quot;ownyourownmodem&quot; scam. </s>
<s> Just get a cable modem from the usual box store and the usual wifi N router and you're set. </s>

<s> Beings you are on the Comcast 20/5 it would pay you to get a D3 modem. </s>
<s> If you are in a D3 area that will give you 4 bonded channels down. </s>
<s> If your not now in a D3 area, you will be before long. </s>
<s> Your speeds will be more constant with the bonded channels. </s>
<s> No more of the 6 to midnight slowdowns. </s>
<s> They are also testing bonded channels on the upload so that will just be a matter of time. </s>
<s> I use a Motorola SB 6120 modem and a Netgear WNR 3500L router and that setup works excellent doing the same thing you want to do. </s>
<s> Bestbuy carries both the modem and router. </s>
<s> I am looking for same. </s>
<s> I want modem/router combo. </s>
<s> I hate all the wires. </s>
<s> Let me know if you were about to find a unit which has modem and router </s>
