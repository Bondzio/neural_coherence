manually configuring the network.
1) What OS is being used?
2) Workgroup name should be the same on both machines.
3) File and Print sharing enabled and a folder or more set to share.
4) Firewalls down until you have a working network.
5) XP/2K may require you to set up a user account for the each machine to log in to.
An unplugged Network cable message is just that, the NIC does not see a cable attached to it.
Which in your case seems right for the laptop not having a cable plugged in.
