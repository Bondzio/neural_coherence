'this magnetic material is divided into clusters, pipes, sectors' pipes???
i don't think so!
'what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer' again i don't think so.
one thing it is looking for is &quot;lost clusters&quot;, clusters that are marked as in use but they are not.
another thing it is looking at is the &quot;indexes&quot;.
i could go on but i won't.
