1.1.1	Hello everyone, happy new year to all... Well, not so happy to me, I lost my most important hard drive a few days ago and I need to replace the logic board.	St
1.1.2	These are the characteristics of the drive I need: * Hitachi Deskstar * Capacity: 80.4GB (80.0 nor 82.3 would work, it HAS to be 80.4) * Model Number: IC35L090AVV207-0 * ATA/IDE * P/N: 07N9685 * LBA: 160.836.480 sectors * RPM: 7200RPM * MLC: H69205 * CHS: 16383/16/63 * Date: FEB2003 - N155 * S/N: G3C57XKD I've looked on eBay too but it's impossible to find this type of drive there.	St
1.1.3	I'm really desperate and need your help.	St
1.1.4	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	http://www.partstore.com/sl/2/187798-hitachi-08k2525-deskstar-804gb-35in-hd-08k2525.html	St
1.3.1	Yes, I saw that one but seems like although is 80.4GB the Part Number is not correct, the one I need is 07N9685 and that disk's Part Number is 08K2525.	St
1.3.2	This is so frustrating...	St
1.3.3	Thanks for your reply.	St
1.4.1	http://www.memory4less.com/m4l_itemdetail.asp?itemid=-6140&selected=accessories And they can ship in less than 24 hours.	St
1.5.1	to do the backups ...right ?	Ques
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Thanks!	St
1.6.2	Yes, the P/N is the same, no doubt about that.	St
1.6.3	However, the capacity stated is 80GB...	St
1.6.4	I attribute this to the fact that they just round up the capacity for advertising purposes and don't put the EXACT capacity (80.4GB or 82.3GB) as they should.	St
1.6.5	So I called, talk to this guy and asked him if he could send me a picture of the product to which he said he can't because the drive is at their warehouse (somewhere).	St
1.6.6	Nonetheless he's going to find out the Model Number and the EXACT Capacity of the drive and send me an e-mail once he has that information... hopefully he wasn't playing with me.	St
1.6.7	Sigh...	St
1.6.8	Thanks a lot for your help.	St
1.7.1	I fixed my drive, I replaced the PCB and it worked perfectly So the things I learned that needed to be considered when finding this new drive I were: * Brand (duh) * MLC: H69205 * P/N: 07N9685 * Model Number: IC35L090AVV207-0 * EXACT Capacity: 80.4GB (80.0 nor 82.3 would work, it HAS to be 80.4) These 5 characteristics need to match, otherwise the PCBs you use won't work.	St
1.7.2	Thanks to all, Zuertex	St
1.8.1	Would have been a whole lot easier, less stressful and saved the many many hours you spent at your labor rate had you done the BACKUPs.	St
1.8.2	Hoping those who read will realize you were very lucky and take action to minimize the risk of data loss or start saving to pay for expensive data recovery.	St
1.8.3	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	This forum is not about backups, is about replacing a PCB in a hard drive.	St
1.9.2	I did have backup but my situation was very particular and it's not relevant to the forum, so you have no idea what you are talking about.	St
1.9.3	If you know what to look for when you need to replace the PCB of a hard drive, you won't be lucky, you will be smart because it will always work.	St
1.9.4	Sigh... thanks to everyone who tried to help me	Polite
1.10.1	problem won't help one iota.	St
1.10.2	If you'd been so smart you'd have been able to replace the drive (from any mfg), restored an image to it and been done with it.	St
1.10.3	VAPCMD PS ..	St
1.10.4	If you take a moment to look around, you'll note the FORUM is about anything folks post here .	St
1.10.5	.	St
1.10.6	.	St
1.10.7	not just (PC) hardware.	St
1.11.1	i'm probably like you vap.	St
1.11.2	i would have used this failure as an excuse to get a new drive (320gb for $80 with a 3 year warranty) and restored my backups to it.	St
1.11.3	downtime would have been maybe 2 days.	St
1.11.4	i hope the original poster realizes that even though the logic board's been replaced, the mtbf clock on the internal components was not reset and is still ticking.	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
