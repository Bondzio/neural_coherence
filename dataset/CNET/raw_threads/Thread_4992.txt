WD40, is an oil based product commonly used to prevent rust or simple lubrication like hindges, bolts, sliding parts, etc.. Similar products are LPV, Marvel oil, CRC, or Liquid Wrench. FYI -Orginally used to prevent rust on Atlas rockets/parts in storage. Hope this helps... -----Willy

Metals by nature rusts, especially iron. WD40 adheres to the surface but not within (deep penetration action). The surface may not have rust on it, but how about the inside. WD40 in layman's term is a lubricant, especially created or manufactured through research to remove the squeaking sound (but not always) from stucked or rusted door hinges or any assembly thereto. It also helps in un-bolting stucked bolts and nuts, helps dries up wet car distributors, etc.. WD40 became so popular that many car owners and people fond of doing some fixing have it. There is one brand though better than WD40, and they claim that they are the only ones approved by NASA in lubricating the Space Shuttle program carrier though more expensive. I do not want to name the brand though else, I might be mistaken for advertising.

Long before became WD40 popular it was used as a rust preventor or &quot;inhibiter&quot; on stored rocket parts. Since these parts were and since usually a one time use, it became important to maintain thier integerty. It also didn't attack common componets at the time and upon evaporating its reside wasn't harmful or became a problem. It's use became so popular amongest the engineers it was later developed as it has become known for private use. Its orginal use wasn't as a lubricant but as I stated. Of course it has became a multi-purpose use since, whether it orginal chemical makeup is the same as that used for rocket protection I'm unsure of. -----Willy

You won't be spamming or advertising unless you are employed by the company and then that will be debatable used in the context of this discussion. I have heard and could it be a product from the X-IR corporation that produces also a gun lub/cleaner, or the VCI Vapor corrosion inhibitor with their numerour spray types labeled NOX-RUST, or perhaps Bullfrog (Bullrog) Rust Blocker approved by the Navy and used by the Military and NASA? Please tell us.

A absolute honest true story: Years ago when I had a 1940's era auto, the right front tire rod (ball socket connected to steering of right front wheel) fell off dragging on the ground. Came to a halt as just couldn't steer properly with one wheel. Well, fished around in the trunk and found a coathanger. Mind you now, this was before Duct Tape was invented. Used the coathanger to wrap around and hold the socket in long enough to drive 20 miles home then next day 20 miles back into town to the auto dealer to get replaced. The mechanic could hardly believe I could have made it with that coathanger. Even today, I always have a coathanger and Duct Tape in my trunk. JR

I am still using WD40 though and they had been used by NASA too. There are many new lubricant brands being advertised now, even X-1R's is a new product (correct me if i am wrong) and history will judge for their effectiveness. LOL.

WD-40 is used today as a liquid or spray un-seizing agent for loosening up Rusted or stuck hardware. I use it all the time on the Studebaker Automobiles I drive. However, I was told that the original use for this product goes back to the 1950's. The formula comes from an early US Army missile project. The contractor created the liquid to help prevent cracks & chipping on missile nose cones. I hope this answers your question.

That's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed WD-40 back in 1953. The chemist, Norm Larsen, was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion -- a task which is done by displacing water. Norm's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try.

As far as I am aware, WD40 was invented in britain during the Second World War (in 1940), by the War Department for use with any mechanical lubrication. Thus the name stands for War Department 40 (of 1940), the application made into an aerosol came later - about 1950.

WD-40 has been around since 1953 it is a Spray Lubricant/Penetrating Lubricant/Water Dispersant for mechanical parts it can be used to loosen rusted bolts and nuts. It can be used in some electronic components like Volume controls when they make noise while adjusting volume. There are other brand products like CRC-556 that do the same job, I hope this was helpful, visit www.wd40.com to find out more. Keith

This one was given to me by my son-in-law. I had a problem with a bee's nest and was out of the 'Wasp and Hornet' spray (you know, the kind of stuff that kills them instantly from 20' away). My son-in-law told me that WD40 did the same job. So I tried it on a wasp nest. Wow! they curled up instantly. I guess it displaces the moisture in their bodies so fast they don't know what hit 'em. Way to go WD40!

Courtesy the WD-40 website: In 1953, a fledgling company called Rocket Chemical Company and its staff of three set out to create a line of rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for use in the aerospace industry, in a small lab in San Diego, California. It took them 40 attempts to get the water displacing formula worked out. But they must have been really good, because the original secret formula for WD-40which stands for Water Displacement perfected on the 40th tryis still in use today. Convair, an aerospace contractor, first used WD-40 to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion. The product actually worked so well that several employees snuck some WD-40 cans out of the plant to use at home. A few years following WD-40's first industrial use, Rocket Chemical Company founder Norm Larsen experimented with putting WD-40 into aerosol cans, reasoning that consumers might find a use for the product at home as some of the employees had. The product made its first appearance on store shelves in San Diego in 1958. In 1960 the company nearly doubled in size, growing to seven people, who sold an average of 45 cases per day from the trunk of their cars to hardware and sporting goods stores in the San Diego area. In 1961 the first full truckload order for WD-40 was filled when employees came in on a Saturday to produce additional concentrate to meet the disaster needs of the victims of hurricane Carla along the U.S. Gulf coast. WD-40 was used to recondition flood and rain damaged vehicles and equipment. In 1969 the company was renamed after its only product, WD-40. WD-40 Company, Inc., went public in 1973 and was listed Over-The-Counter. The stock price increased by 61% on the first day of listing. Since that time, WD-40 has grown by leaps and bounds, and is now virtually a household name, used in numerous consumer and industrial markets such as automotive, manufacturing, sporting goods, aviation, hardware and home improvement, construction, and farming. In 1983, WD-40 Company sales reached $50.2 million. Many companies attempted to introduce imitation products, going so far as to copy the distinctive blue, yellow and red colors of the WD-40 can. In 1993, WD-40 Company celebrated its 40th anniversary by breaking the $100 million sales mark. That year the company was also listed among the Top Ten Most Profitable companies on the NASDAQ exchange. Not bad for a company with only one product! WD-40 was found to be in 4 out of 5 American households (it seems everyone has a can or two) and was used by 81 percent of professionals at work. Sales had grown to more than one million cans each week. The most interesting piece of WD-40's history is the uses for the product, now numbering in the thousands. The uses include everything from silencing squeaky hinges and removing road tar from automobiles to protecting tools from rust and removing adhesive labels. But they get a lot crazier than that. Over the years, thousands of WD-40 users have written testimonial letters to the company sharing their often unique, if sometimes just plain weird, uses for the productmany of which are shared in other parts of this Web site. Some of the most interesting stories include the bus driver in Asia who used WD-40 to remove a python snake which had coiled itself around the undercarriage of his bus. Or when police officers used WD-40 to remove a naked burglar trapped in an air conditioning vent. Very few brands will ever match the popularity of WD-40. In fact, the variety and uniqueness of uses for WD-40 proved so popular that The WD-40 Book, (Bad Dog Press 1997) featuring many user testimonials and the wacky humor of the Duct Tape Guys, was published in 1997. But WD-40's literary legend doesn't end there. The familiar blue and yellow can has been featured in other books ranging from The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness (General Publishing 1997), Polish Your Furniture With Panty Hose (Hyperion 1995), WD-40 for the Soul: The Guide to Fixing Everything (TV Books 1999), and Talking Dirty With the Queen of Clean (Pocket Books, 1998) to college textbooks.

WD-40 is a light oil in an aerosol (spray can) but it is not primarily meant for lubrication. It is a Water Displacing fluid ie. dries out electrics, hence the WD. The 40 stands for the number of efforts to get the formula correct. It does dry out and hence is really no good as a long term lubricant but is great for the electrics on your car, boat etc.

It however is short lived as a lubricant as it was made to evaporate. If I recall it is made of a solvent and kerosene and when sprayed on a surface would cause the wate to lift and float on the film and be wiped or washed away with the WD40

In article &lt;...&gt; B.Hamilton@irl.cri.nz (Bruce Hamilton) writes: &gt;The WD stands for Water Displacing. I haven't analysed it,( not commonly sold here ) but somebody (Professor Toraki? )squirted some down a GC/MS and confirmed the solvent was boiling around 150-200C and only contained a minor % of aromatics, which means it is either a narrow boiling range kerosine fraction, or a special narrow boiling range solvent like low aromatics white spirits. It is listed as Stoddard Solvent - which is actually a low aromatics White Spirit. It would have a boiling range between 150C - 200C and an aromatics content below 20%. According to various sources, the typical liquid product contains:- 70% low aromatic white spirits ( stoddard solvent ) ~20% lubricant base grade ( solvent de-waxed, paraffinic type ) 10% of corrosion inhibitor ( some formulations use 2 inhibitors, normally they would only be present at low concentrations, so it's possible that the inhibitor could be something crude like an oil that produces a hard film with synthetic additives ) 5% of wetting agent ( probably quite low concentration, other the formulation would emulsify some water which could affect theprotective film's durability and performance ) &lt;5% of fragrance. The aerosol versions adds 25% of LPG as propellant to the above( probably with less of the wetting agent to minimise foam ) My earlier suggestions aren't too different from the above.

It can be sprayed into a lock cylinder to get it working again; used on rusty hinges to reduce or eliminate squeak; used on rusty bolts/hardware to help loosen them; sprayed on the surface of metal that you may need to drill through-it keeps the drill bit cool and lubricated and helps to maintain a sharp point, etc. There are many other uses. It can be purchased at just about any hardware store or home center such as Lowe's or Home Depot. I've even used to keep honing stones lubricated in automotive work for brakes and engine blocks. Please be sure to follow the manufacturers recomendations for safe use of the product. It is petroleum based and toxic and may even contain some graphite. Good luck.

I think your original question has been answered 50 times over, but no one has mentioned my favorite use for WD40: removing those nasty price stickers and product labels from things I buy. Just spray the sticker with WD40, let it sit a few minutes, and voila! The sticker comes right off. If you don't want the WD40 residue on the product, just wipe it off with a paper towel and a little alcohol.

WD-40 is a chemical used to displace water (Water Displacement) on parts exposed to excess moisture and condesation. The &quot;40&quot; means it works down to -40 degrees Farenheit. Some folks use it as a lubricant but it's not intended for that purpose.

Dot matrix is old tech, but for draft papers, when you need to use NCR forms or just when a cheap print out is required, they are still great. For single non-business letters, my 24 pin printer is still my main unit. Anyway, a dot matrix printer uses an ink ribbon; a print head physically strikes the paper though an inked ribbon in a dot pattern. The dots are close enough to each other and often overlap, so that our human brain sees the dots as readable characters. The area of impact is only in the middle, so the print gets lighter as you use it. You can open the printer ribbon and give a VERY LIGHT spray of WD-40. This will desolve some of the ink from the top, unused part of the ribbon, and make it print fine for a while longer.

WD40 is a fluid that is used to dry out and isolate electrical circuits. &quot;WD&quot; stands for &quot;water displacing&quot; and the &quot;40&quot; is the number of times the experiment to produce it was carried out before the product finally worked. Some people mistakenly think it is used as a lubricant. It is quite good for that in the short term - it will free seized nuts and bolts etc. The trouble is it tends to dry out. So using it, say on a lock or window runner will result in the problem reappearing after a while. Tis good stuff for vehicle electrics. It is available in aerosol and drip/oil can formats.

It stated it was composed of Oil & White spirit. There is certainly more, as you state, Bruce, as you can smell the perfume, and the wetting agent is probably soap. (these would not need to be stated.) You could make, very simply, a good substitute at home, out of things in the workshop. When I worked as a Radio & T/V repair man, we used to make it in this fashion if we ran out of switch cleaner. (Remember this?)In fact to reduce the risk of corrosion a lot if items, (Soft greases oils etc) were mixed with parrafin substances, as when they were painted on the surface, the solvent dried out, leaving the greasy coating to exclude the air, so preserving it. That said, Its very handy in aerosol form. I bought a second hand gas cooker of a lady that had altered the kitchen so it didnt fit. She picked up a can to spray & clean the grease of it before I took it! Handy stuff Mike Scargill (UK)

The Corvair Company bought it in bulk to protect their Atlas missile parts. The workers were so pleased with the product, they began smuggling (also known as &quot;shrinkage&quot; or &quot;stealing&quot;) it out to use at home.

Only one of them is the &quot;brew master.&quot; There are about 2.5 million gallons of the stuff manufactured each year. It gets it's distinctive smell from a fragrance that is added to the brew. Ken East says there is nothing in WD-40 that would hurt you. Here are some of the uses: Protects silver from tarnishing Cleans and lubricates guitar strings Gets oil spots off concrete driveways Gives floors that 'just-waxed' sheen without making it slippery Keeps flies off cows Restores and cleans chalkboards Removes lipstick stains Loosens stubborn zippers Untangles jewelry chains Removes stains from stainless steel sinks Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill Keeps ceramic/terra cotta garden pots from oxidizing Removes tomato stains from clothing Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors Keeps scissors working smoothly Lubricates noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes Gives a children's play gym slide a shine for a super fast slide Lubricates gear shift and mower deck lever for ease of handling on riding mowers Rids rocking chairs and swings of squeaky noises Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to open Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards in vehicles, as well as vinyl bumpers Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons and bicycles for easy handling Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools Removes splattered grease on stove Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging Lubricates prosthetic limbs Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell) Removes all traces of duct tape I have even heard of folks spraying it on their arms, hands, knees to relieve arthritis pain.

It was for a few days. Then the shafts seized. What remained after the volitale agents were evaporated was approximately 70 weight oil according to our lab. I always judge if what I want to spray, over a long term, can tolerate 70 weight oil.

It really has almost unlimited uses. According to their site, It's 5 primary uses are: 1. CLEANS: WD-40 gets under dirt, grime and grease to clean. It also dissolves adhesives, allowing easy removal of labels, tape and excess bonding material. 2. DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because WD-40 displaces moisture, it quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits. 3. PENETRATES: WD-40 loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts. 4. LUBRICATES: WD-40's lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed and tenaciously held to all moving parts. 5. PROTECTS: WD-40 protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements. For more info, go to www.wd40.com

It is great for hinges that are stuck or for any other task that requires a light lubricant and comes with a slender tube to attach to the nozzle to direct the spray into a small space.

WD 40 is ok but a better anti-corrosion option is ACF 50 which is used in the aircraft industry.It protects,penetrates and lubricates. It prevents and deactivates corrosion on metals and safely lubricates and penetrates mechanisms.

It was developed by NASA scentists in the early sixties to prevent rust and other contaminants from destroying critical space hardware with great results. The name is derived from the letters WD, which mean Wipe Down. The 40 refers to the number of formulas they used before finding the one that worked. Thus Wipe Down 40, or WD-40. Don't think I'd spray it near my computer though.

According to the WD-40 Company: &quot;WD-40 literally stands for Water Displacement, 40th attempt. That's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed WD-40 back in 1953. The chemist, Norm Larsen, was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion - a task which is done by displacing water. Norm's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try.&quot; WD-40 was invented in 1953, by the three members of the Rocket Chemical Company of San Diego, California. They were working on a line of industrial rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for use in the aerospace industry. WD-40 was first used to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion. Norm Larsen then repackaged WD-40 into aerosol cans for consumer use and the product was first sold to the general public in 1958. In 1969, the Rocket Chemical Company was renamed after its only product, WD-40.

WD40 may be fine for certain uses on computer systems but, the items must remain in an environment that is as low in humidity as you can get. Otherwise, the humidity will allow rust to reapear on the cleaned surface. In other words, it might work great in Arizona but, don't plan on the same results here, in South Alabama! Being an avid hunter, I tried it when it became popular to use on firearms and paid the price for not keeping constant check on them. For it's quality to loosen rested,frozen bolts/screws, it is easily surpassed but B'Laster, found in Wal Mart and most automotive parts stores. IF you desire fast work on rusted or sticking parts and a remaining thin coat of lubricant, this should be your &quot;weapon of choice&quot;. It's accomplishments read like a &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; product. BUT....this is my automotive and sports related background speaking....not that of my limied computer experience. My suggestion: Read the labels on each product, check their corresponding web sites for their products usage, get a small can of each and evaluate them yourself....for your personal usage. What works for one, does not always satisfy the other. Have a good day....just my personal opinion.

Most of the good properties come from the fact it is based on solvents, which will react with things then evaporate and thus remove them. This is particularly noticeable is applications involving Hydrocarbons, most notably in crude oil derived substances such as lubricating oils, cooking oils, greases and various fuels. This is why it is so good at many cleaning applications, particularly in the kitchen, as the polarity of the solvent will break down the bonds. The polarity is also responsible for the water displacement, as the water will also evaporate in the same fashion. But enough of chemistry. It should not be seen as a genuine lubricant. Yes it does help things to slide past each other in the short term, but once the solvents have evaporated residues are left behind which can actually cause problems in itself, so by solving one problem you can cause another. I work for a major petrochemicals company in the lubricants division and I'm not going to name it, but from my work it is very obvious to me that there are very few lubricant products that are suitable for every task, you wouldn't cook with the oil that you put in your car and so the same principles should be applied to the use of WD-40. Having said all that, it is good at a lot of things, but you must always bear in mind it does evaporate so will often be a short term solution and lubricating oils or greases should be considered in most applications, there are many oils around which arent black and thick and gloopy like that which you put into your car and the technology around is such that there are many oils/grease designed for the specific application which whilst costing slightly more than WD-40 would do will do the job better and for longer.

They worked well for only about a day or two. The company tech support explained that WD40 causes plastic parts to swell, and kills the spraying action. they had to make a very special sprayer to work with WD40.

Every night before going to bed, she used to rub her knees with some warm portion of kerosene that she took from the tank of the lamp. Growing older, I met a few people making use of vaseline for the same purpose -- soothing the pain from arthritis. Being a kid I remember every time I caught a cold my mother used to rub my body with kerosene mixed with alcohol. I was not able to find a study relevant, but I believe there must be a connection with arthritis since the main part of WD-40 comes from distilled petroleum

WD-40 is not going to leave anything black by itself, but it will become sticky enough to capture dirt and dust, making it black - so you have a dirt problem, which WD-40 can help clean, but only temporarily. I use WD-40 and similar products to clean the stains (tobacco and other) off some computer equipment parts, (and remove labels,) off some electric and electronic parts, very carefully (slight sprays, clean with q-tip or towel, etc.) Then I clean contacts with contact cleaner to remove possible coatings left behind, other cleaners if needed on other parts, not just WD-40.

WD-40 is a product often used to displace water, and rumor would have it the name is derrived from &quot;Water Displacement Formula #40&quot;. It is available in spray cans and as a bulk liquid in one gallon cans (3.73 liters). The contents, according to their material data safety sheets are approximately 45 -50% stoddard cleaning solution (aka dry cleaning solvent) and 50 - 55% mineral oil, plus a tiny bit of perfume/scent marker. You can find more about their product lines at www.wd40.com , or the spanish-language site at www.wd40.es Cheers =-= The CyberPoet

You use it on old squeeky (possibly rusted) door hinges, screws and whatever needs lubrication (no sex jokes) such as your Swiss army knife.

I remember using it more than 20 years ago. The &quot;WD&quot; refers to water displacement. The &quot;40&quot; refers to the 40th test number that was finally approved for use. It is sold in spray cans and by the gallon can that you can use in their own sprayer (works like a Windex spray bottle). You cannot use it in any sprayer other that the one that is labelled &quot;WD-40&quot;, because the product attacks the rubber parts of the sprayer. The sprayer will leak where the 0-rings are located, causing leaks and an inoperative sprayer. The container is blue and yellow. It's a good product. The only problem I've had using it on my boat's engine surface, was that once the solvents evaporate, a gummy coating was left behind. It was protecting the metal from the salt air. It is/was used by gun owners too, to protect the metal surface. I've used a product that was called &quot;CRC-556&quot;. It didn't leave the residue. It was marketed by the CRC Company. I believe it is not sold any longer. Now I've been using a product called &quot;TKX&quot;. It works much better than all the spray lubes, rust busters, metal protectors, etc. I've used it on metal parts that are frozen together, waited a sufficient amount of time, which could be a few minutes to hours, and the parts come apart. I work in an oil refinery where we use &quot;Liquid Wrench&quot; and used &quot;WD-40&quot; for many years. We still use LW, but all of the mechanics raved on the quality of &quot;TKX&quot; We get it in spray cans. It is a fantastic product. I've personally love it and haved saved a lot of valves that were frozen solid. I applied the product, waited, and worked the bolts/ threads, etc. and have operated them without having to replace/break them. If you can locate it, TRY IT! The can is multi-colored with blue-green, red, black, and white colors. Made by LPS I just looked at a can. Their website is &quot;www.lpslabs.com&quot; Thought I'd throw my two cents in the pot! Hope this info is what you were looking for.

For those who doubt that there are &quot;many&quot; uses for certain products, they should take a small can to someone who has arthritis and ask them to try it. Given the time span, for those who now have these problems, it is quite likely that the person has already heard of the use of WD 40 by some arthritis victims. Nothing is better than verification from a previous &quot;doubter&quot;. Given that there is more than one &quot;type&quot; of arthritis, the results are going to vary. Area climate will also cause a variation in results. The higher the humidity, the more noticable the effects. GOSH, maybe it has something to do with the moisture consumption of WD 40....who knows, for sure? One thing is for sure, though....it is definitely cheaper than the meds that are used for &quot;pain reduction&quot; caused by the disease. Until you are directly effected by arthritis, you will never appreciate a can of WD 40, as much as you will then. It isn't an &quot;Old Wife's Tale&quot;, that's for sure! In fact, I think I'll get me an extra can in town this afternoon. Until then, just use it on the other meaningless places.

What has just transpired, in the last few postings, is a failure to view it as only one piece of a huge puzzle. However, this is the norm! If we dig deep enough, we will find &quot;some&quot; supposed health reason not to use 90% of everything on the market. An old axiom comes into play, at this point. Follow the money trail, it never lies. Remember, in the pre-1950s, the farmers used DDT for everything. Those living in the vicinity of these farms had little problem with the worrisome insects that we are bothered with today. It wasn't long until it was banned because it was claimed to cause cancer. Years later, it was proven to have been a false judgement. Was it brought back into use? No! Why? Just look at the number of products on the market as a directy result of its removal, self-explanatory. NOW! Look at all of the vegetables that are brought into this country from countries who use this and even more supposedly cancer causing products on their fields. Were they, our government, really interested in OUR health? Not at all! Their actions show it and our gullibility and personal fears allow this to happen, at an ever increasing rate. When it comes to our health, the real benefactors are the product producers...not the people. What about the time when we were being warned not to sit so close to the TV??? Computer monitors are much different, I guess! WD 40 is, no doubt, a good product and does the majority of what it claims. But, IF we're going to eat what we eat and smoke what we smoke (including putting up with eating next to a &quot;tobacco addict&quot; at most meals) then...why in the world worry about a propellant with a possible cancer causing agent in it? The same person will probably be more effected by the smoke that was blown into it's face, as a toddler, by one or both of it's parents, who knew of the bad effects but just didn't give a ----. Besides, one is probably adversely effected by other surrounding agents much worse than WD 40. Basically, what I am trying to say is: if it serves the purpose....use it. Our great caring government doesn't really care what happens to you anyway, as long as you pay your taxes and don't accuse them of doing any wrong. Their real interest, regardless of political party, is what will produce the most money and keep the sheeple satisfied. As mentioned by another poster....it probably isn't even the &quot;liquid&quot; WD 40 that was initially being questioned anyway. Relation to &quot;site subject&quot; is worth the thought. After all, what would most likely be considered if one questioned &quot;Colt 45&quot; on this forum? Malt Liquor, a firearm, a night club or a Video Game. SEE? It was the most popular that first came to mind. Enjoy the Thanksgiving left-overs and sit a few inches farther back from the key board. I'm quite sure there are many in America without them.

I used a lot of LPS products, years ago. In the early '60s, I got involved with B'LASTER, a product of PBBlaster that was becoming a popular rust penetrant....definitely awesome. I would like to compare the two. Their web site is: http://www.pbblaster.com and readily available in Wal Mart, auto supply stores, etc. They once had a car polish that was unbelievable, hope they still do. It was cheap and had to be frozen to activate the contents. Nothing wound adhere to a waxed surface that it was applied to. I even had to sell an old fiberglass bass boat that I stupidly waxed the floor and then later tried to 3-M some Astro-Turf to it. I ended up having to use a cup brush on a grinder to get it out of the gel-coat and the glue it down so it would stick. The top surface of the boat was so dangerously slick, when wet with water, that you took your life in your hands to try to walk on it without slipping. I guess some products mean what they say they will do. This incident taught me to always consider the advice of the salesman, at least the first time, anyway.

I hope you all don't get down on Jinks too much and I hope he doesn't get down on himself for a honorable attempt to enlighten people! I too have been a member of a Joint Health and Safety Committee with the Union in the Big Three Auto Factory (DaimlerChrysler). It pays to be cautious whenever possible! If you know a chemical has POTENTIAL SIDE-EFFECTS, you try to substitute a less dnagerous chemical as a precaution! This is why we have Water-Based paint in the factories now instead of Solvent-based Paints! Something as simple as fingernail polish remover is going to mess up many lungs from using it in rooms that are not very well-ventilated! Look at what Asbestos has done to many,many workers! The side-effects took 20 to 40 years to show up; but by then it is usually some form of terminal respiratory illness. Companies used Asbestos for years and the Government knew it and did nothing! When you can show that you used Asbestos years ago, they just usually pay you because they know that the stuff caused the long-term lung problems claimed by its victims. Of course, they can fight it like they did the man who invented delay-windshield wipers, and pretty much try to let you die first or settle for pennies on the dollar with their big-time lawyers! Even when the law says to tell people what they are using and make sure they understand first, many companies just give it to thier workers, unless their Union (if they have one; if not, heaven help them) is diligent in fighting to protect them. Companies had to be forced to inform and protect their workers, and theystill hate to follow these rules and to truly inform you as the law calls for! WHY? You know why; they want you to use it and shut up and get your work done!

It is not clear where it is manufactured, I have to assume it was in China because of the Label. ( I have lived in this region for over 30 years ). WD40 is a product for &quot;mechanical&quot; application. It is to be used ONCE on or at the mechanical item. Then the item has to be cleaned, including removal of all traces of WD40 and lubricated according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should it be used in or in any part of a Computer. WD40 is a cheap chemical with the ability to supplement lubricants for a very limited time. It changes its chemical properties very rapidly and can be very harmful even to fairly heavy gear. It should never be used for bearings of any kind, unless such bearings will be replaced immediately with the right lubricant. WD40 destroys lubricants, it does not replace them. TO REPEAT: WD40 IS THE DEATH OF ANY PC SIMPLY DUE TO ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. I have an MS in Applied Engineering and a second one in High Precision Engineering (below 1/10.000th mm); Nowadays called Nano-Technology. WD40 and a PC MUST be 5 meters apart. Best regards, Harm

The real world fact is, WD40 is very much a practical and useful product. Its improper use maybe more for a quick fix or just to get over the hump sorta speak. Its a penetrant and protective sheen for many items and as a lubricant(a very light one) it not intended to replace the orginal lube/oil of the item being used on, just a quick fix until repairs or proper attention is given. In fact: WD40 was never intended to a lube spray but a &quot;protective coat for rocket parts&quot; in storage. Added usage came later and still very few products does as it did in the beginning. As for PC usage, try not using it in the jungles of the world, besides keeping the innards free of bugs it also helps keep moisture from preventing mildew or similar. In the Artic, it too helps free parts for quick release in a PC and lessens frost build-up on innards of PC but only in short duration. Yeah, I did it and only an old tech shown me that. good day -----Willy

From what I understand, the &quot;40&quot; is a number to indicate the formula used. When I was in the U.S. Navy in the early 1970's, its use was forbidden on Navy ships because it caused the water to dissipate and removed any protective oil on the surfaces that it came in contact with, allowing rapid corrosion. I do not personally use it for anything except priming a diesel engine, as needed. It has no other uses for me. If I need a lubricant or penetrant, there are many other fine products available. Hope this helps.

I had a letter from the manufacturers of the patented product when they were owned by Cadulac Chemicals in the 1970s They informed me that the product contained Animal Waxes (that is Tallow) Petroleum based waxes (rather like Vaseline) All borne up in a 3 to 1 concentration of White Spirit. This is like a turpentine substitute. The turps does most of the Surfactant work displacing water and the waxes do the lubrication. It was safe to use in Piano actions, on wood, cloth and brass pivot pins and didn't dissolve any of the old fashioned Scotch Glue, or Animal Glue. The company said I should be careful to make sure I didn't use it on any Cold-moulded plastics and there aren't any of those used even in modern pianos. The lubricant was used to free up sticky components that the wooden parts had swollen with moist air or damp conditions. It was very effective and had no long term side effects. So I just thought I'd put in my two penny worth to let you know it doesn't contain oil. Or at least it didn't when the inventors started making it. I think the US Navy invented it and they had 40 attempts at the right formula hence Water Displacer 40 Hope that doesn't all sound smug but I thought the record needed straightening.
