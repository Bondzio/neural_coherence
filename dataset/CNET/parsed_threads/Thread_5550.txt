<s> Hey Guys My computer just now is based around the still respectable Athlon 3200 XP so its not exactly ready for the scrap heap but i bought it January 2005 when 754 wasent quite the brick wall it is the now so upgrading means a full system upgrade which aint really a bad thing cos a PCI-e board will be well good! </s>
<s> Anyway, my question is how do the 4400 and 4800 dule-cores compare to the 3200 - obviously i assume that they are both better but are they worth the high price tags attached. </s>
<s> The reason I have not mentioned the 4600 is because im keen on having the 2mb cache which only the 4400 and the 4800 have. </s>
<s> In the end i think upgrading is gonna be the best plan but is it worth upgrading to the 4800 at almost double the price or will the 4400 do me just as well? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
