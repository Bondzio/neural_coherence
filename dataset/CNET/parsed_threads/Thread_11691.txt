<s> I have an old desktop Pc that I haven't touched in months. </s>
<s> Now, it won't turn on, but the HDD, CD-Rom and Unit on lights just blink. </s>
<s> It's about 6 years old. </s>
<s> A celeron 366. </s>
<s> Please help,please and thanks. </s>

<s> I have had the same problem in the past and now. </s>
<s> My old Pentium 233MX Windows 98 SE with 128MB of ram a 1.2 GB harddrive. </s>
<s> The first time the 166MX Processor Burned up. </s>
<s> It was under warranty at that time. </s>
<s> The second time the power supply went out. </s>
<s> Now my motherboard is fried. </s>
<s> I will have to get a new motherboard and new case and start all over again. </s>
<s> In your case it can be your processor out or something else. </s>
<s> If your have friends who know a lot about computers that would be your best bet. </s>
<s> For them to check it out. </s>
<s> My experience has been that the power supply is old, hungry and sipped from its final water hole. </s>
<s> You can try blowing it out with a can of compressed air. </s>
<s> Take the cover off and clean it out. </s>
<s> Use a soft thin paint brush on the fan blades and components. </s>
<s> It's worth a try. </s>
<s> But if lights are going on (real low voltage) and no fans are turning...well... Oh, replace the battery on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
