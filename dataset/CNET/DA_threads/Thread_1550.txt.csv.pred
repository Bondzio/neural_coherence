1.1.6	Oh ... I am on a budget !	St
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	From about age 6 had a PC .	St
1.2.2	Now he 's 10 and has his own PC .	St
1.2.3	I rarely have to help him out , but did last week as we installed an entry level video editor so he can make his own video production .	St
1.2.4	I 'm sure there are Macs too , but I am a little PC oriented due to work and more .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Since you did n't say what your budget is it is hard to say .	St
1.3.2	But many people get a new computer and give the older one to the childern .	St
1.3.3	If you have a MAC then go that way .	St
1.3.4	If you have a PC go that way .	St
1.3.5	John	St
1.4.1	I would go with a cheap Pentium 4 or a cheap Athlon XP ... they really do n't need top of line if they are that young .	Sug
1.4.2	I would say I good idea would be to get them a webcam/video camera for computer so they can make stupid videos and stuff .	St
1.4.3	That is just my opinion tho .	St
1.5.1	If you can get a working used/freebie ( given ) computer of at least 500Mhz or better will be decent enough for them to enjoy small pgms .	St
1.5.2	and/or kid interaction type programming .	St
1.5.3	They will learn the basics and still be able to get internet access with enough speed to be comfortable .	St
1.5.4	Being used , the system will be very cheap if & quot ; working & quot ; no repairs other than maybe getting to a clean slate as it were .	St
1.5.5	Otherwise , a cheap system and I do mean cheap but affordable are in the $ 500 range or cheaper if brought on sale , supplied by Compaq , HP , eMachines , Wal-Mart , K-Mart , Best Buy , Circuit City , Fry 's and verious online sources .	St
1.5.6	That system is usually an entry system is normally new or a & quot ; reburbed & quot ; one that 's returned to as new condition , just read the fine print .	St
1.5.7	The side benefit of a vendor supplied system is usually some OS and s/w bundle in part of the deal and basic warranty , if new , less warranty if reburbed .	St
1.5.8	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.6.1	Gee , everyone has made good suggestions and for children that age it would be best to go for an inexpensive used or low priced as others have suggested .	St
1.6.2	The webcam/video camera that cv4stm suggest is inexpensive and should be a hit with them .	St
1.6.3	He should know as he has stated before that he is 15 years old .	St
1.6.4	When my grandchildren come over they play with my 500MHz desktop that I paid $ 2375 for 6 yrs ago now worth about $ 200 , or the emachine 766Mhz .	St
1.6.5	If they need to play a current high tech game then they use my 2.0 GHz desktop .	St
1.7.1	i did see something a little bit ago about a disney-themed desktop geared for kids - complete with mickey ears on the monitor .	St
1.7.2	i believe it is in the cnet desktop reviews .	St
