It's probably a simple answer to my problem, but I don't think it's the PSU.
I also don't know much about graphics cards, but the specs say the card requires a min of 350W and my PSU is 380W.
380 is not much more than 350 and I guess it could affect the performance of the card, but I think I should still see some video on the screen if it meets the min.
