Is the 5 port swith a router also?
If is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then I would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple.
You can also set the net on PC A then run the XP network wizard on PC a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on PC B telling it to get NET access from PC A.
*** Do not foget on to distinguish the NIC cards on PC A properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled.
Good luck
