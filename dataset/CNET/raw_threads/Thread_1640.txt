My wife has bought a Toshiba laptop with a US Robotics 22Mbps wireless card. I am trying to get it to recognize my wireless router on my desktop. The router is a D-Link DI-624. I am on an ADSL highspeed connection and my server says everything appears to be working-re the desktop, but the laptop cannot connect. It worked in a different location other than home (connecting to another network) and it worked in another location using my D-Link router. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

721	2	59557	707993	707096	penagel	1/23/05 9:02 AM	1.10647092E12	Any messages from Laptop connection?	Is the laptop displaying any messages (ie., Limited or no connectivity, network not connected, etc) What kind of settings do you have for your security (WEP, PSK, etc) I have the same router and have encountered a few problems. At first when I connected everything worked like a charm, then the issues began where it would not connect using WEP security encription. I now have no issues after reseting the router and running the PSK security setting. It runs through three walls and some 50 feet away. Give us a little more info in terms of messages being displayed in the laptop itself.

721	5	59557	708354	708322	skybound	1/23/05 11:27 AM	1.10647962E12	I can't click connect	because there is available network. The brian 192.168.1.100 I get from the D-Link wizard on my desktop. I'm feeling pretty lost at the moment. I'm completely new to wireless and everything is greek to me.
721	6	59557	708909	708354	Michael Geist	1/23/05 4:19 PM	1.10649714E12	It seems &quot;Brian&quot; is the desktop(hard wired) PC....	and &quot;?&quot; is the Toshiba? Have you run the Network Setup Wizard within the D-Link router? Access the routers setup program from your hard wired PC by typing 192.168.0.1 in a browser address bar.
