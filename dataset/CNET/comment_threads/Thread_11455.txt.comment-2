My only caveat is that you didn't use a &quot;redundant&quot; power server case.
Everything else appears OK, too.
As for the case, that PSU will do, but here too you may want to have a spare PSU.
Now, make darn sure all of this is well cooled, which a server case would have provided and have amble room as well.
Just check out server cases to get a feel of what I'm suggesting here.
I do like 100% you use a true server mtrbd.. tada -----Willy
