Today I put in a wireless internet card, the internet works fine, but the card seems to be causing a problem with my audio device.
When the wireless card is in my PC I get this odd static and screeching noise from my speakers/headphones.
I know the wireless card is causing it because if I take it out the noise goes away.
There are 3 open PCI slots between the two, I thought putting some space between them may help, but I was wrong, and I honestly have no idea what else to try.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
If it matters, I'm running Winxp, the wireless card is Netgear wireless-g PCI adapter- WG311v3, and the audio device is a CMI8738/C3DX PCI Audio Device.
