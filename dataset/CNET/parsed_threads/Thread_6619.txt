<s> I have a 2005 Dell Dimension 5150C with Windows XP . </s>
<s> It has a CDRW/DVD drive (Philips SCB5265). </s>
<s> I want to get a DVD writer & am not sure if I should get an external or internal writer. </s>
<s> Which is best? </s>
<s> Which is easiest? </s>
<s> And which do you recommend? </s>
<s> Please, please help me. </s>
<s> That is a small forum factor PC. </s>
<s> While it came with a DVD as an option, it seems unless you buy the unit expressly made for the SFF case, it would be much easier to use an external drive. </s>
<s> If you do buy the internal, here is how you install it. </s>
<s> http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim5150C/en/sm/parts1.htm#wp1075764 High speed USB (2.0) would give you close to internal speeds, so assuming you do not want to go the internal route, I see no real reason to be concerned. </s>
<s> I kind'a like the external more as I can use it on different machines. </s>
<s> Portable is nice. </s>
<s> I also prefer building my own. </s>
<s> Get a good external case and pick your own drive. </s>
<s> If your power supply can handle the extra load then go internal if not external is just fine </s>
<s> existing DVD. </s>
<s> Here's an IDE DVD-DL by Pioneer that's getting good buyer reviews at Newegg. </s>
<s> Many others to choose from. </s>
