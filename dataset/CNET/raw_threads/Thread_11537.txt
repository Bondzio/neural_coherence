I bought it used from Goodwill and am trying to put together a computer for my grandfather. It came without a harddrive. when I turn the power on without a harddrive it will power up and I can get into the bios, but when I install an IDE harddive, it does not boot. The fan runs, but the monitor remains black. Please help.
