What you need to do is look at the router's documentation and find its default IP address. From there, you set a static IP address in your PC that's within range of the router. Example...if router's IP is 192.168.1.1, make your PC 192.168.1.2. Then, open your browser and access the router using http:\\(router IP address). This should bring you to it's web interface where you will have to enter a username/password. There should be a default noted in your documentation. Once you successfully enter these, you can make the changes you need. Change the password as well. Hope that helps.
