I recently started using an external hard drive with a USB 2.0 connection to backup all my important documents.
The drive is USB powered and NTFS formatted.
On multiple occasions during file transfers the drive would 'hang' and explorer would become &quot;Not responding&quot; and I would be unable to &quot;safely remove USB device&quot;, forcing me to turn off the PC or yank the USB cable out.
Now many of my documents and folders have become &quot;corrupted&quot; and unaccessible.
Is there any way I could salvage that data or restore it?
I appreciate any advice...
