<s> I have a requirement to be able to Write Protect an external hardrive. </s>
<s> We have unclassified data that we need to move to a classifed system. </s>
<s> The whole purpose of write protecting is to insure that no sensitive data is inadvertantly copied to the external drive while its connected to the classified system. </s>
<s> We currently have 6 Maxtor 250GB drives that do not have any type of physical switch for enabling write protection, nor does their software enbable us to do that either. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a procedure we could use to enable write protection on these drives? </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a external drive that has a physical/software means of enabling write protection? </s>
<s> We put it on CDR or DVD-R and moved it over. </s>
<s> The CDR and DVD-Rs were put in the burn barrel for destruction later. </s>
<s> This was the only solution our security officer would accept since the write protect can... fail. </s>

<s> An ancient original post, but still a current problem... </s>
<s> I use internal hard drives to store all of my data, and I use various external USB/firewire enclosures which conveniently allow me to hot-swap my hard drives and take my data to other computers. </s>
<s> There have been several occasions where friends of mine and I personally have lost all data on external hard drives - corrupting the data on external drives seems to be a fairly common problem that may occur for instance if the drive is powered on while the computer reboots, or if you connect to a computer with an old operating system, or if you hook up additional external devices that don't get along with yours. </s>
<s> I find this situation very troublesome, and I would like my data to be protected from this kind of corruption. </s>
<s> I am not interested in password protecting my files, or preventing them from being read, but simply in preventing deletion and corruption. </s>
<s> In my opinion, there can be no software solution to this problem: Even if it worked, it would only apply to one system, and not to any arbitrary system I would like to hook my drive to. </s>
<s> It seems that the only secure solution would be an external enclosure that only allows read commands to the enclosed hard drive. </s>
<s> It would be nice if this write protection could be turned on and off with a switch, but a permanent one would be just as good (I can always put the drive in another enclosure if I want to write to it). </s>
<s> It seems that to find this kind of device, you need to add the word &quot;forensic&quot; to your search, as if forensics were the only application that this is useful for. </s>
<s> Some search results that offer IDE to either USB or firewire: ~$100: http://www.cooldrives.com/firewirepcmcia.html $195: http://www.coreprotect.com/core_shield.html $330: http://www.cooldrives.com/usb20toatast.html $400: http://www.logicube.com/products/accessories/usbwriteprotect.asp $980: http://fwdepot.com/thestore/product_info.php/products_id/1086 Good luck... </s>
<s> For the price, form factor, etc... the best I could find was the UltraBlock USB write blocker... this is a USB device you plug &quot;in-line&quot; and it will write protect what ever is connected to it. </s>
<s> It is a Hardware Write protect, so it isn't prone to failure. </s>
<s> They aren't cheap...to the tune of $300 each, but being a simple &quot;in-line&quot; USB device that cannot be accidentally &quot;unwrite protected&quot;, it is worth it. </s>
<s> Yes, it does NOT have a switch on it... it is always in READ ONLY mode. </s>
<s> A big plus if your security officers are paranoid. </s>
<s> Too bad I don't live/work in the UK. </s>
<s> Plextor has a write protect hdd available to Europeans. </s>
<s> http://www.plextor.be/products/px-ph08u.asp?choice=PX-PH08U It is NOT available in the USA. </s>
<s> I've already looked. </s>
<s> I wish it was. </s>
<s> I even contacted Plextor to try and find out what it would take to get some here. </s>
<s> The guy on the phone was a real smartass about it and wouldn't lookup any contact info for anyone in the company that would actually know something. </s>
