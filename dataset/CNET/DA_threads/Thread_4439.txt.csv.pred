1.3.3	Possibly A motherboard / processor package?	St
1.3.4	thanks, nascar4Num9	St
1.4.1	if you proceed with this &quot;upgrade&quot;, you'll wind up with a pc that's still behind the curve.	St
1.4.2	anyway, here's an agp based mobo for $70: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157115 and a core2duo 2.4ghz e4600 for $120: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115032 since you're willing to spend some money, start from scratch: core2duo 3.0ghz e8400, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115037 4gb ddr2-800, $85: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820145184 ecs 9600gt/512mb, $147: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814134038 gigabyte p35 mobo, $82: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128084 about $500 gets you a top-performing PC.	St
1.5.1	What im thinking about doing is a serious upgrade.	St
1.5.2	Performance wise, can I use my sata hard drive?	St
1.5.3	Also, on my graphics card, is this one that you would upgrade?	St
1.5.4	Thanks, Nascar	St
1.6.1	Is the case up to date to fit all new motherboards?	St
1.6.2	ATX..I assume so?	St
1.7.1	and the 9600gt is the best bang-for-the-buck video card.	St
1.7.2	if you add a new case and power supply like the antec sonata iii below for $100, you can try to sell your old pc for $150 or get a $400 tax deduction by donating it to charity.	St
1.7.3	http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=204559259&SearchEngine=DealTime&SearchTerm=204559259&Type=PE&Category=Comp&Gad=0&dcaid=15891	St
1.8.1	Ok...I was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive.	St
1.8.2	News is that due to its age, my new Arca Sim Racing game will not work....so...im going to take the challenge on.	St
1.8.3	Im not that up with all the hardware stuff.	St
1.8.4	The gentelman that suggested the things above I think are excellent suggestions.	St
1.8.5	What If I wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal?	St
1.8.6	That would total out to 1,100?	St
1.8.7	If you were in my situation, what setup would you get?	St
1.8.8	Also, will my existing case support the new mobo?	St
1.8.9	Thanks, nascar4num9	St
