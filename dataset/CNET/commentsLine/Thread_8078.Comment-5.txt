i cannot understand the wide-screen mindset for computers or for tv.
people are taller than they are wide (most are anyway).
spreadsheet and text papers are taller than they are wide.
everything that we use a computer for or watch on tv is generally vertically oriented.
then everybody, programmers and crapware distributors as well, want to add toolbars to shorten an already too short vertical space on the screen.
now they want to squeeze more vertical space away from us with a &quot;wide-screen&quot; aspect ratio.
are we down to about 3 lines of text without scrolling now?
very silly and counter-productive to me.
