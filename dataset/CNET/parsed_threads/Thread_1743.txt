<s> i used dvd shrink after dvd decryptor when capturing the files. </s>
<s> when i was using dvd shrink it said there was an error so it couldn't burn it to nero? </s>
<s> (i can't remember the exact wording)but all my files were shrunk properly and were fine to burn. </s>
<s> Just sharing. </s>
<s> I didn't use dvd decryptor. </s>
<s> Just let dvdshrink backup my dvd. </s>
<s> Your procedure is yours. </s>
<s> I prefer simple. </s>
<s> Best of luck and remember I can not offer ANY support for this program. </s>
