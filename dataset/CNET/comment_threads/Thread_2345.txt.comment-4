You also need to take into account that the computer would be required to run Windows Server Edition (64-bit Standard or Enterprise Edition) rather than standard Windows.
The idea is also to have 8 processors.
Not necessarily because every program I have will use the 8 processors, but because I tend to bog down standard PCs by trying to run the Adobe suite all at once.
Though I wouldn't expect that much ram to slow down Windows because Windows only uses X amount at anyone time.
I don't know if the concept would help with running a game such as Crysis (using it as an example because the game has ridiculous specs at the moment).
