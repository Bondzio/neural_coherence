When it reaches 256 it just stops there and leaves a blinking cursor underneath. The person this computer belongs to mentioned that the keyboard has been acting up. I am using a totally different(and brand new keyboard) and nothing. Is it possible that something happened to the port on-board so that now the keyboard cannot work? I can get the files off by putting this hard drive into one of my dummy machines, but should I tell this person to start shopping for a new PC? I really can't see it being anything else but the keyboard port. I even reseated all the cards and memory and still no luck. Any advice/suggestions are greatly appreciated!:-) Thanks Ekaba

I asked the person about the memory or anything else new he may have tried to put into the PC, but he states that nothing new has been added. He only says that over the past few weeks the keyboard has been acting up and now the PC cannot get past the POST. Any other ideas what it may be? Thanks! Ekaba:-)
