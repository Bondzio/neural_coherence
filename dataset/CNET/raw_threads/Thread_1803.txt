I can get some 255MB SD Stick from Sandisk for about 50 bucks. There may be no reason for a review since nothing differentiates the sticks of memory. Bob

It has worked like a charm with my lap top, even when I used it on a Mac. I am thinking that a 1 gig stick would be even better and before I went out looking for one, I would see if a particular brand is better than another. I guess they are really like floppies and all about the same quality.
