<s> So a couple of days ago I had a post about how I would go about using my external drive on a PC to transfer data (I've been using it on a Mac for several years). </s>
<s> I was told that formatting it would erase the content so I opted not to do that. </s>
<s> However, now when I tried to hook it up to the same Mac its been used on for years it won't mount at all. </s>
<s> Instead it makes a weird clicking noise over and over and will not load! </s>
<s> Does this mean the drive is dead and I've lost all my data?! </s>
<s> I have never had a single problem with this drive and just the other day it was working fine. </s>
<s> Is there no way to recover the data from my external drive at this point? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The DO IT YOURSELF methods are not assured but save a lot when they work. </s>
<s> For example put the HDD in another enclosure. </s>
<s> And when all fails you get it to http://www.drivesavers.com But may I ask where is the backup copy? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks I'll give it a try. </s>
<s> Do you mean the backup copy of stuff I had on the drive? </s>
<s> I was copying everything from a Mac to the drive and my other (PC) computer. </s>
<s> So everything is kind of spread out between the three but I didn't finish before this happened. </s>
<s> Of course I have hard copies (cd's) of the music files but I've still got a good amount of stuff on that drive that I didn't get to copy... </s>
<s> It appears nothing was lost as you were only copying things around. </s>
<s> That's a good decision on your part as some folk try to &quot;move&quot; rather than copy and lose stuff during the move. </s>
<s> Mayne the new external case is the best idea and then a new drive for that case if the drive has failed. </s>
