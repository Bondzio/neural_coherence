Hello, I am someone who basically knows nothing about routers in general and need help.
I have a Dell Dimension 8400 with XP and a Macbook on order.
I am looking at the Linksys WRT54GS, but I do not know how the desktop will connect wirelessly.
Do I need some sort of card or adapter?
I dont know anything.
Please be specific.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you
