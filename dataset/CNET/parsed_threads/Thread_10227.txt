<s> Long story short i had to enable WPA 2 on my home network. </s>
<s> I've tried this once before bu took it off when one of my computers did not allow me to enable WPA 2 on it. </s>
<s> I have3 home computers: The main one is running Vista and he other 2 are both XP (I know that doesn't make a difference). </s>
<s> And they both have wireless cards. </s>
<s> Both Linksys. </s>
<s> One is Linksys WMP11 ver 2.1, and the other is a Linksys WMP54GS ver 1.4. </s>
<s> No the latter supports WPA 2 on its setup tab. </s>
<s> I am able to enter the password and it works fine. </s>
<s> But The other, the WMP11, is a older card and does not list WPA 2 in the drop down list. </s>
<s> However when using XP's Wireless Connection window, it tells me that it found a signal and that its WPA 2 encrypted. </s>
<s> So i open it up, type in the password, it shows a connecting window, and then just goes away after a minute. </s>
<s> No error messages, nothing. </s>
<s> And i still can't get connected on that computer. </s>
<s> I've also downloaded the patch from Microsoft enabling WPA 2, but i can't seem to get it to work. </s>
<s> I've tried everything short of downloading SP 3, which one person said would help. </s>
<s> Is there something i'm missing with XP's WPA 2 patch? </s>
<s> Is there a way to do this? </s>
<s> (I'd but a new card but i'm short on money) </s>
<s> But please tell why WPA isn't good enough. </s>
<s> We note this in our forum sticky and have yet to find a good reason to move to WPA 2. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Honestly i cant tell you, i just know that WPA 2 has better security. </s>
<s> If WPA will do the same then i'll use that insead. </s>
<s> Which encryption should i use TKIP or AES? </s>
<s> I've read that WPA is just as good as WPA 2 but harder to set up right. </s>
<s> And THAT question is one for the ages. </s>
<s> I will share I use the router defaults. </s>
<s> Let's go with the forum admonishment and advice first. </s>
<s> Let's not repeat all the discussions about TKIP or AES. </s>
<s> In other words, do you want it to work? </s>
<s> Thats all i've been trying to do. </s>
<s> Get it to work but be secure. </s>
<s> There is no exploit noteworthy today for WPA that won't take months and months at banging away at your network. </s>
