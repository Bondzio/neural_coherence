O.k.
looks like problem solved.
Has been running on DVI for few days without a problem.
Just updated driver on ATI All-in-Wonder 7500.
First time it started failling againg after I fiddle with some settings.
Re-loaded driver (ATI Catalist) left it almost as is.
Using just one of the Windows original screen saver (Starflight)- works great.
