1.1.1	My comp is not a gaming rig , not even close to being one .	St
1.1.2	I can still play some games but at a slow framerate pase .	St
1.1.3	What I want to know is .	St
1.1.4	When you lower the resolution in the game , it shows improvement in every aspect except picture quality , but on mine if I lower the resolution in windows and the game is shows dramatic improvement .	St
1.1.5	Is this just a thing in my head or does this happen in everyone elses comps ?	Ques
1.1.6	When computers get tested for benchemarks Frame Rates do they do this or what ?	Ques
1.2.1	the game , the monitor , the video card .	St
1.2.2	No standard effect .	St
1.3.1	at 800x600 the video processor must process 480,000 separate pixels .	St
1.3.2	At 1024x768 you get 786,432 pixels .	St
1.3.3	That is almost double the number of pixels .	St
1.3.4	But the only thing I could n't figure out was why the performance was n't along the same lines as the number of pixels.. How can my friend run at 1600x1200 with only a 20FPS difference ?	Ques
1.3.5	The effect is negated by the number of textures , the number of objects and the number of polygons in the game .	St
1.3.6	Since these are a constant that take up a majority of the processing power , the number of pixels has a smaller but still noticeable effect .	St
