<s> I'm sorry if this isn't the correct place for this question but I wasn't sure where I should put it. </s>
<s> My issue is that every time I play the Sims 3 on my desktop the game crashes. </s>
<s> Now what happens is when I'm playing the game my screen while go out for a few seconds and come back on and then the game itself will be darker then it's suppose to be. </s>
<s> Now it's not the monitor's brightness because if I go to my desktop everything is fine, it just happens in the game. </s>
<s> Now my computer says that my display driver igfx has crashed and recovered. </s>
<s> So my true question is does this have something to do with my graphics card or is it something else?? </s>
<s> Computer Specs are: Vista Home Basic, Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5200 @ 2.50 GHz, 2GB RAM, Intel G33/G31 Express Chipset Family, and a hard drive capacity of 320 GB. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=igfx+stopped finds this is not uncommon with this video solution. </s>
<s> I'd look at replacing the video card. </s>
