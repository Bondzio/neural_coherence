<s> I have recently bought a 64 GB memory stick and I am having problems opening some files copied on it. </s>
<s> Some windows media files won't open and I get the following message: Windows Media Player cannot play the file. </s>
<s> The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file. </s>
<s> I also have similar problems with some power point and word documents. </s>
<s> The USB memory stick is unbranded and is fomated as FAT32. </s>
<s> My operating system is Windows Vista Ultimate </s>
<s> CODECs are hard on users. </s>
<s> Use VLC PLAYER next time to avoid learning about them. </s>
<s> Also, FAT32 is cruising for a bruising. </s>
<s> Why use old unreliable? </s>
<s> Sounds as if it MIGHT be a codec issue, before you try to transfer anything else to your F/D download and run the AVI codec pack and see if that doesn't do the trick. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> Maybe I did not clarify that the same file plays on another memory stick and on the computer. </s>
<s> Only when copied on this new memory stick it does not paly. </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> I have tried the VLC player as recommended, but still did not work. </s>
<s> I do not think it is a problem of the CODECs as the same file plays on another memory stick on the same computer. </s>
