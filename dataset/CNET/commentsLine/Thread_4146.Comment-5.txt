so if i was to go the &quot;cable select&quot; route rather than master/slave, the cable select would be selected on both drives?
how does the system know which drive to boot from?
another issue i have thought of is the fact that i have a usb keyboard that is not &quot;active&quot; until i actually choose a profile.
is this going to cause problems?
