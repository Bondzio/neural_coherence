<s> using a windowxp pro os... with plenty of ram stick with onboard audio and a soundblaster pci card... now is it possible to use two soundcards at once.. now the reason im asking is because i have two separate inputs specifically for mic..i'd like to record simultaneously... guitar and voice.... now ive tried the splitter and it really degrades the signal... as we know with a splitter we get half the channel... by the way i am using a soundblaster live 5.1 ... with line in mic in headphone and line out ... any ideas ? </s>
<s> thankyou kindly </s>
<s> NO! </s>
<s> You will have decide on one sound card. </s>
<s> You could get an externial audio mixer to mix the audio then send it to the line input. </s>
<s> Or get a pro type sound card like the M-Audio Delta44 which has 4 line inputs. </s>

<s> you generally will discover that you need special applications to make use of the second card. </s>
