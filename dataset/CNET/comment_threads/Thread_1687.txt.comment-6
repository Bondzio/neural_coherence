In no uncertain words, I would not put a stick into a machine I am not willing to sacrifice to test the stick...
If the machine works, then you can just use it.
My note about defragging being a dangerous idea swirls around other people that had bad ram and during defragmenting (with known bad ram) they ended up with a nonbooting system.
After such problems, defragging is best just put off till you know the system is healthy.
