anybody have opinions on which wireless g router is best?
does anyone have a website that will compare them in terms of speed, range, stability, etc.
the cnet comparisons are difficult.
also, is the 108mpbs really needed - i have about 4 computers to hook up together, not much sharing between computers mostly just internet.
i can't see the real advantage but it is only $20 more.
thanks
