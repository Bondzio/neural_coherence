(1) does the surge protector have a warranty.
(mine has a $$$ replacement/repair warranty on attached devices.
(2) you stated the cpu boots, but you have no control.
hd works.
the motherboard has a problem.
(3) do you have a spare slot, and can invest less than $20?
if so, get or borrow a usb 2.0 card, and see if that works.
your system is booting: psu, video card, and hard drive are working.
it's the usb and serial ports that are out.
