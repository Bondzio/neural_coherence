For example http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WGT624NAR&cpc=HPM and even cheaper units are out there with full retail N class units at 99 bucks or less so there is no money in repair and you won't pay any counter to test your unit since for less money you get a new wifi router.
Does that help?
