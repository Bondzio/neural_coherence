1.1.1	Hi , I have a recently new western digital portable passport harddrive ( 250gb ) that does'nt seem to want to work , When its plugged in it gives five beeps and then is not recognised by the computer .	St
1.1.2	i contacted WD and all they could say to me is its broken send it back .	St
1.1.3	Anyone have this issue before any way to fix it ?	Ques
1.1.4	if not what kind of recovery software would you recommend to get the data from the drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	thanks for your help , Ger .	Polite
1.2.1	I 'm going to give you the short version but you can read other posts to learn the path is ... new case and maybe software like GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY .	St
1.2.2	Also testing on other PCs is required .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	hi thanks for the response , i have read a good few of the topics on this forum with similar problems to my own but am still no closer to fixing the problem , after trying a few of the data recovery program suggested ( sadly none worked ) , i took the hd out of the enclosure and put it into my desktop as a secondary sata drive - then turned this drive to AUTO in the setup .	St
1.3.2	however upon bootup i get & quot ; Error auto-sensing secondary hard drive drive 0 & quot ; click f1 to continue and it starts to boot but then resets i.e .	St
1.3.3	i never get into the OS with the HD turned on .	St
1.3.4	so i am still no nearer to recovering the data that is on the drive anyone else any suggestion that i could try ?	Ques
1.3.5	again thanks for all your help , Ger .	Polite
1.4.1	I did n't see where you tried like others .	St
1.4.2	i.e .	St
1.4.3	other USB case .	St
1.4.4	As to moving to the internal I find most ca n't configure the machine proper or the machine 's bios or manual is nearly incomprehensible when it comes to configuration .	St
1.4.5	In those cases , back to the USB case .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi again , sorry if i missed some info : have tried the external in different pd 's but same problem , have also got a loan of another enclosure and tried it in that and also no differnce , so it sure seems that the problem is with the hd itself , hope this helps - my main focus is the recovery of the data - i know i can send the hd off to a clean room etc ... but was looking for a fix i can do myself thanks again , Ger .	St
1.6.1	Is when you put the drive internally on the machine is that the OS boots up and you see that drive in the BIOS .	St
1.6.2	I ca n't tell where you missed a setting because the details are not here .	St
1.6.3	If it 's the usual IDE drive I suggest we unplug the CD/DVD drives and use that cable .	St
1.6.4	I 'll stop here and not write how to jumper drives , what cable types , etc ... Bob	St
1.7.1	Hi bob , my main os is run off a sata hd and the external is also a sata drive , so when i placed the external into the pc there were two sata drives present only , therefore as far as i know there are no cable settings etc to worry about - the only thing to be done it turn the drive to auto in the bios settings - which i did ( the drive was read by the bios as a hard drive type with 0 capacity i.e .	St
1.7.2	it was not reading the hd correctly - then on bootup it gave the error described above before it would automatically reset ) thanks for all your help , Ger .	St
1.8.1	AUTO is fine but you have to immerse yourself in the BIOS of the machine and maybe rearrange which drive goes to which SATA port number .	St
1.8.2	Usually the boot drive is connected to the lowest number port .	St
1.8.3	But all this is not standard as I can sometimes set the BIOS to another port .	St
1.8.4	You are very close to the solution .	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	Hey Bob , i changed the ports in which the drive were set , this time it did not get past the boot stage i.e .	St
1.9.2	it did not recognise an operating system which tells us that the ports were correct in the first place , so i then took the hd and placed it into another pc with the os hd in the lowest port this time it acts as it was before i.e .	St
1.9.3	error message and windows starts to boot however instead of simply resetting itself it bluescreened .	St
1.9.4	so seems like the pc simply wont take the hd , have you any other suggestions toi get the data - maybe our best method might be placing it back in the external and trying to access it through there ?	Ques
1.9.5	thanks , Ger .	Polite
1.10.1	An external case to USB is a good idea .	St
1.10.2	Try a new case if the old case is suspect .	St
1.11.1	Hi bob , yeah we tried a different case and it didnt work , it looks like the pc wont boot with the second sata operational therefore i was suggesting putting it back into the case and using some more data recovery tools to get the data - are any other tools we havent used ?	Ques
1.11.2	any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.11.3	thanks a lot , Ger .	Polite
1.12.1	Did you mean GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY did n't find the drive in all situations ?	Ques
1.12.2	If so , then contact drivesavers.com if the data is needed .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
