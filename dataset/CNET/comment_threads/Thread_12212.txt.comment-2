How is the BIOS set for the memory timing?
Is it &quot;by SPD&quot; [uses the data in the PROM on the memory stick to set timings].
Unfortunately I do not know how the system will handle different settings provided by the 3200 vs the 2100 stick.
Remember that the the 128 is slower memory and if it is in the slot whose SPD is read it will set the lower clock speed for all slots.
If the 3200 SPD is read then the system would set the memory speed too fast for the 128 MB stick.
As I noted this is a wild arsed guess and doesn't explain the results of all the options that you tried.
Try going into the BIOS and set don't use &quot;BY SPD&quot; and set the timings to the lowest speed possible and try one stck at a time.
I have seen on some mobos, that when all slots are full the system drops the memory clock down to the next lower.
