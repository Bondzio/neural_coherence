<s> if heard all about intels core 2 extreme qx6700, but im still a little fuzzy about what computer i should invest in. </s>
<s> mostly all i do is download movies and surf the internet while chatting with friends. </s>
<s> in your opinion, which computer should i buy if i were to JUST download large movies, and why. </s>
<s> and again in your opinion, which one should i get if i downloaded large movie files AND had a few im's open while having a few internet explorer tabs up, and why. </s>
<s> i think im leaning somewhat towards the apple mac pro. </s>
<s> but once again, i cant make a decisive decision. </s>
<s> all i want to do is access the internet, clicking on links and having them load lightning fast, while i have my downloads going.........which i would also like to go as fast as i can. </s>
<s> i should also mention that price doesnot matter to me. </s>
<s> thanks for all your help, john </s>
<s> Even though price isn't an issue for you, I wouldn't pay a premium for a top of the line CPU. </s>
<s> Today, a Core 2 Duo should be fine for what you do. </s>
<s> Since you watch movies, maybe put the extra cash towards a nice monitor or a killer surround sound system. </s>
<s> any suggestions on a system that will fulfill my needs for the best deal? </s>
<s> I wouldn't worry about getting a quad-core system but rather focus on having a big network connection where you may connect over some fiber-optic connection if you want &quot;lightning fast&quot; downloads as with the downloads and the IMs and the surfing these all share the same pipe which is the connection you'd have and you did say that price wasn't a factor. </s>
<s> I'd suspect most AMD Athlon 64 x2s or Core 2 Duos wouldn't break a sweat on these things and if you have at least a couple gigabytes of RAM then you should be fine except for that network connection. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> I'm currently running a Core 2 Duo, and it's incredibly fast. </s>
<s> I would say that a quad core isn't really necessary. </s>
<s> I agree with the other people, perhaps a lot of money shouldn't be invested in the computer itself, but with other features like a nice monitor and speakers. </s>
<s> For a monitor I would suggest a Dell 24&quot; or potentially a 30&quot; if you are willing to spend the cash. </s>
<s> A Logitech 5.1 surround system like the 5450 would do you very well. </s>
<s> A good sound card (X Fi of some type) and a decent graphics card would serve you well, I don't know how many games you play. </s>
<s> If you don't game much, I would suggest a 7600GT. </s>
<s> I would also stay away from the Core 2 Exteme X6800, because for about the same price you can get the quad core Core 2. </s>
<s> For your needs though I think a Core 2 Duo e6700 would probably be best. </s>
<s> For movies and entertainment a good sound card/monitors/speakers is always a good deal. </s>
<s> Also, a very nice new TV Tuner came out - the Vista View Saber, which if you have an available PCI-e x1 slot it is available (cnet review here: http://reviews.cnet.com/Vista_View_Saber_2020/4505-8902_7-32166004.html ). </s>
<s> Investing in Windows Vista Home Premium or Ultimate when it comes out is highly recommended too. </s>
<s> Unless money really isn't an issue at all, I would go dual core. </s>
<s> But if your heart is set on quad core, I would go with the Intel QX6700, with the above components as well. </s>
<s> ya if u want media fo for da mac,... games&lt;pc pc is alot better for gaming becuase its upgrades are more widespread(my 1200 $ pc is better than any possible mac for gaming) if you want lightning fast downloads look into fios from verizon i got it and i download from firefox@ 4 megs per sec ^_^ hope this helps </s>
<s> I use a 500mhz, 160MB of Ram, 2x20 gb hard drives to download all my 'legal isos of linux distros'. </s>
<s> I even run peer guardian 2 in the background. </s>
<s> if you want really nice framerates go for the 7900 gto(its the same exact card as a 7900 gtx eccept no hd dvd wich u might want wif a nice screen but 250$ is cheap for a nice gpu </s>
<s> ya c2d e6700, 7900 gtx, 2gb ram, a nice MB wud be fine for that </s>
<s> I run a Dell 22&quot; as my primary and a second Dell 30&quot; for watching movies/tv on a 7600GT and it has no problems at all. </s>
<s> Unless he needs gaming, 7600GT is fine. </s>
<s> It's also good for Vista (scores a 5.5 and 5.9 in graphics), which will keep him good until he decides to get DX10. </s>
<s> What speed is your FiOS from verizon? </s>
<s> Is it 15 or 30 mbps? </s>
<s> im planning on having a Panasonic TH-37PH9UK double as a tv monitor as well as a comp monitor, a ps3 for gaming as well as playing blue-ray movies, and the computer is the last thing i have to decide on. </s>
<s> sound is my last priority. </s>
<s> but if i have the cash, ill go for good sound as well. </s>
<s> si o no in terms of the setup?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> ya its pretty fast, ill download@ 4-8 megs/sec wif firefox </s>
<s> the 7900 gtx has hd dvd capability wich he might want with such a good monitor </s>
<s> 7600GT has HDCP as well. </s>
<s> I can't believe no one mentioned RAM. </s>
<s> Having an adequate amount of memory is possibly the most important factor in doing all of those things at once with no slow down. </s>
<s> (Obviously, connection speed is very important, and a good processor too) Basically, all the stuff your computer is currently doing is stored in the RAM. </s>
<s> If it runs out of RAM, it starts using the Hard Disk to store data. </s>
<s> One analogy is that the RAM is your desk and the Hard Disk is a file cabinet down the hall. </s>
<s> Imagine having to make a few hundred trips up the hall every day because your desk is too small. </s>
<s> The above recomendations are good (like a quality video card for actually *viewing* the movies) but for the tasks you described, make sure to get 4Gb of RAM (2Gb, if cost is a concern; but not less, or expect slowdowns) </s>
