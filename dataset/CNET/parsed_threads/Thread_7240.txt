<s> I'm in the market to buy a new monitor. </s>
<s> I don't need any gamers stuff, but a monitor that has good contrast and brightness. </s>
<s> I am thinking of this one. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience from this monitor? </s>
<s> Or even opinions. </s>
<s> I am going to get it a little cheaper through work... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Have you gone to http://www.newegg.com and looked at their monitors?? </s>
<s> Your link said that they were out of stock. </s>
<s> I also make certain that the one that I buy has a three year warranty. </s>
<s> Here's a link to four pages of monitors. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=20&name=LCD-Monitors . </s>
<s> Don't get confused when you note that the X inch Wide screen monitors are lower priced than the regular X inch monitors. </s>
<s> The wide Screens have considerably less viewing area, thus the basic screens are lower price. </s>
<s> of inexpensive monitors that are good in the 19&quot; range. </s>
<s> Unless you have obvious resolution, refresh or performance issues, its a matter of support and price. </s>
<s> Got to someplace like Frys, CompUSA or Best Buy and see which ones look good to you. </s>
<s> I've been very pleased with I-Inc monitors from www.TigerDirect.com at 1/2 that price and use them in dual monitor mode at work, both wide screen and normal. </s>
<s> About $149 - $169 after a mail-in rebate (usually). </s>
<s> Try walmart.com they have good brands like samsung and viewsonic, very cheap prices compared to other websites like tigerdirect and bestbuy. </s>
<s> I got an e-mail from Buy.com that was having a sale on Monitors. </s>
<s> I think it might of had the monitor you are looking at there. </s>
<s> (I know it was a view sonic) </s>
