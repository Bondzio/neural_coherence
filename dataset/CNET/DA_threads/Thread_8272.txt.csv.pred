1.1.1	Been thinking of getting a tablet for a few weeks now and am having trouble deciding between the iPad and the galaxy tab .	St
1.1.2	I 've played around with the Note and I quite like the tablet ( not sure how different the note is to the galaxy tab other then the specs and a flashy stylus ) , but it 's a little out of my price range , however I have some reservations about the galaxy tab .	St
1.1.3	I currently own an android phone , the HTC One X and have some disappointing issues with it and because of that I am uncertain if it want to invest in an Android tablet , although I am beginning to think it 's an issue with HTC , not Android .	St
1.1.4	I intend to use the tablet for reading e-books , music , browsing and maybe the occasional video .	St
1.1.5	The one of the problems I have with my HTC is getting media on to the phone .	St
1.1.6	I know you can mount them like a disc drive but I used HTC 's own manager which is utterly horrible , which is one of the reasons why the iPad seems to be a better as iTunes is a lot easier to use as it 's left a bad stain on my experience with android .	St
1.1.7	With the Samsung , I like being able to add more storage through the use of SD card as I do n't really like being locked into just one amount of storage .	St
1.1.8	In the end , I am stuck in the middle with this decision and can not decide , so looking for a little advice .	St
1.2.1	I do n't want to repeat the long discussion about media encoding but what I 've seeing are folk expecting these tablets to play whatever you can on a PC .	St
1.2.2	Nothing is farther from reality .	St
1.2.3	The iPad is a little better at this as you funnel most content through iTunes and it can re-encode content ( sometimes ) and if you get content from the store , it 's encoded properly which makes some folk think it 's a better player .	St
1.2.4	And a runner up is the Kindle Fire .	St
1.2.5	It 's not that expensive compared to the others and with Amazon Prime you get a lot of content .	St
1.2.6	About the media card .	St
1.2.7	With streaming and more , that idea is losing ground .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	Video playback on a tablet is something I would do rarely , I 'm of the opinion that if I want to watch a movie I have a perfectly good TV not far away , it 's something I would do say while travelling .	St
1.3.2	I know the galaxy tab supports more file types but a friend with an iPad has shown me a useful app that will do the same thing .	St
1.3.3	I know adding/deleting music is so much easier on iTunes , add the song and sync , I tried to add a song ( just one ) to HTC sync manager and the program tried to add the entire folder .	St
1.3.4	As for data storage , I agree with you Bob , there are a lot more services out there like the iCloud and Dropbox that I could use if need be .	St
1.3.5	So far the iPad is seeming a better option for me .	St
