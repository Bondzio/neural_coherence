this is a great monitor, however, if you live in the states, you should be prepared to spend about $1500.00 to get one because you must buy it as part of a computer package.
i approached hp about buying one and was told that they could not help me.
it seems strange for them to be so unhelpful, but nobody (and i talked to at least 6 people) could tell me where to buy one of these.
it is available as a stand alone product in canada  i was just about to give up when i found one on ebay.
i love it and would by a couple more if they were available here.
