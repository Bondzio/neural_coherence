1.1.1	You guys always give me good advice when I need it so here goes .	St
1.1.2	I have 2 computers set up on a Linksys wireless router ( befw11s4 ) with DSL .	St
1.1.3	The second computer is continually losing DSL .	St
1.1.4	My question is this : can we keep the main computer on the router as it is now and then run a cable from the router to the second computer , instead of using the wireless or do I need to buy a wired router to do this ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	I see the router has a few plug in 's , so I 'm thinking this can be done ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	But I want to make sure .	St
1.1.7	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If the router has multiple ethernet ports to use , then a hard wired connection to the problem machine can narrow down the possible trouble areas .	St
1.2.2	Use the port .	St
