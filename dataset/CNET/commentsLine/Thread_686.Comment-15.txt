i would like to thank all you guys for your postings,i had no idea such utilities existed,i had a problem with my hd few weeks ago,where the error message said &quot; no operating system installed &quot; i have since got the drive working again,at the cost of losing all my photo's etc,and although i had backed up with cd, i had still lost a great deal that i had not had time to back-up.
having downloaded the freebie suggested, i find my hd is in good health,and no i will not download a reg-cleaner again,as i think this caused the problem {:o( manny
