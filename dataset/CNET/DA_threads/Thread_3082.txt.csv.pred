1.1.1	Graphics card: http://www1.sapphiretech.com/us/pr [...] p?gpid=280 I want to find out if I can connect the computer to an (old) tv via the graphics card's dvi i port.	St
1.1.2	Does the the dvi port support: a) component b) DVI-I RGB?	St
1.1.3	If yes to a) and/or b): The tv is old, 10 years or more.	St
1.1.4	It has 2 scart ports.	St
1.1.5	How do I determine whether the scart ports support a) component b) DVI-I RGB?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	I remember scart has a max resolution of 576i so there is so little gain that I'll just write don't bother.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I don't understand your answer.	St
1.3.2	So little gain, compared to what?	St
1.3.3	I don't want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor.	St
1.3.4	From an older computer that had tv out, I know that the reso- lution supported, is to low for that purpose.	St
1.3.5	But for watching movies and videos is was sufficient (800x600).	St
1.3.6	And that is my question, can I use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port, and by that obtain the above purpose.	St
1.3.7	Still thanks for your effort.	Polite
1.4.1	Let's find a DVI to SCART cable.	St
1.4.2	But no one I know can verify if it works.	St
1.4.3	A quick search finds no such cable which verifies that you'll have to stick with known solutions like S video to SCART.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
