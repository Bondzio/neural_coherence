I tried that after posting and did get video using vga port, but still no video on netbook display.
So I purchased a LCD screen, but only lighted screen and no computer image, still getting computer image using vga port.
Any other ideas, besides buy a new netbook or laptop( I like it because of its lightweight, I am not a gamer).
