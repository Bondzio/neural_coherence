1.1.1	Hello.	St
1.1.2	Today I went to a local hardware shop and asked about DVD-RW because I want to get one...	St
1.1.3	He said Toshiba's DVD-RW is good... Is anyone here have experience with Toshiba's DVD-RW?	St
1.1.4	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	They make drives for other OEM companies, and I have not had bad luck with their products.	St
1.2.2	I just bought an NEC from Tiger Direct for $34.95 after $15 rebate.	St
1.2.3	Be aware that the software that comes bundled with drives rarely if ever has the decoder to allow DVD viewing.	St
1.2.4	I got WINDVD for my wife's new drive.	St
