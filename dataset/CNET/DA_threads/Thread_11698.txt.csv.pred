1.1.1	Hello , I 've currently moved into a college dorm , and the internet works fine , but I am having trouble connecting to game servers such as Steam and Gamespy .	St
1.1.2	Every time I try and refresh , the servers do n't show up , and it is giving me the error of & quot ; Can not connect to master game server & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	I know this is n't the most detailed problem , but I thought others might have had this happen , so maybe I 'll get some hints at what to do .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance for the help .	St
1.2.1	Some game servers and P2P is blocked .	St
1.2.2	Ask around to see if others know why .	St
1.2.3	In closing , it 's not a hardware issue .	St
