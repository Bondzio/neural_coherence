i am trying to access data on a usb external hard drive (western digital wd800u017-001).
the data was put on with a mac.
i am trying to access it with a pc.
in device manager, i can see the drive.
in disk management, i can see the drive but it has no letter assigned.
when i write click the only options available are delete partition and help.
it will not let me change drive letter and paths.
if i try to use the diskpart utility from command prompt, i can see the drive with list disk and list partition but not with list volume.
if i try to use the add or create volume simple commands i get a message that says &quot;the command you selected is not available with this version of windows.&quot; my computer is: windows home xp + sp2 amd athalon 1500+, 512 mb ram, asus a8v266-e motherboard usb 1.0 it is six years old.
any ideas?
