is it possible to charge devices such as ipod, psp, and cell phones without having the pc on but still pluged into the pc?
it has to be since computers at my school's computer lab is able to do this.
i also read about self powered usb hubs could i plug my devices into it and be able to charge them with out having the computer on or having the hub not being pluged into the computer?
