<s> I have a Linksys 802.11 router and my tech guy is pushing me for an upgrade. </s>
<s> I realize there are some other variables involved, but will I really see a difference if i upgrade to a more current standard like N? </s>
<s> Will I need to upgrade my repeater as well? </s>
<s> My ISP is via cable modem. </s>
<s> Forgot to mention my current router is a 802.11b standard. </s>
<s> At top speed 802.11b is 11 megabits. </s>
<s> Your cable modem usually tops out at 5 megabit so no real internet speed may be gained even with 2 users. </s>
