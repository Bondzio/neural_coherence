hi, i have just ordered new parts for a computer, which has not yet arrived, including a sapphire radeon x1950pro 512mb ddr3 and two monitors with only vga input.
the graphics card has dual dvi output and i was hoping to just use two converters (dvi - vga) to connect the screens.
i have now, however, just read that some dvi outputs called dvi-d do not support these adapters and cannot be used on vga monitors.
please tell me if this graphics card will work with them or not!
i can't seem to find if it does or not on the aria.co.uk website.
it only says: digital video standard: digital visual interface (dvi) many thanks.
