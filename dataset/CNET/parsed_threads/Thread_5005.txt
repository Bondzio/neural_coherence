<s> well I had already ordered my Asus g50v a1 laptop and I was looking at the specs on the computer and I noticed that the letters at the end of graphics cards were different(gs, gtx, gt...) and I did some research and discovered that there are different versions of the nvidia 9800 and some are better than others. </s>
<s> My laptop I had ordered had an 9800 gs which some have told me isnt the best. </s>
<s> I have watched some youtube videos of people playing crysis with my same computer but they had an 9700 gt(not a 9800 gs) in it. </s>
<s> Is the 9800 gs better than the 9700 gt and will I be able to play high quality games like crysis? </s>
<s> the 9800gs should be a smidgen faster that the 9700gt. </s>
<s> ok thanks im not to worried anyway I wont even be playing crisis on it. </s>
<s> Im probably going to be playing Counter strike, kotor, diable ext. </s>
<s> on it nothing like far cry 2 and cryisis </s>
