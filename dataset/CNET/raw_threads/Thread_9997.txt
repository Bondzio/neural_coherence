How can I upgrade the graphics? or can I change the graphic card? I came across this NVIDIA Forceware 182.50 WHQL Vista. It is said to improve graphics. Does this actually work? What other ways can I improve my graphics?

That means that 10 frames per second will go to 11. -&gt; As to video cards for laptops there are only ones that your laptop maker makes. If your laptop maker does not offer such cards then it is not upgradeable. If you find people that ask if they can upgrade their laptop video, it just means they haven't been told no enough times. -&gt; Do the usuals to get by. Reduce the game resolution and features. Bob
