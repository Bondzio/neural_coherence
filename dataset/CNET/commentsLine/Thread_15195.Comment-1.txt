i'm looking to upgrade my current system, but i only have $1,400 available to complete the task.
i'm looking to upgrade the basics if i can get away with it for now.
example the cpu, motherboard, ram, case, and power supply.
i am running a agp graphics card right now as well, and if figure i might have to upgrade that as well.
plus i also want to stick with windows xp if i can, i realize that i will have to buy a new copy xp when doing this, and so that cost i have factored out.
so the remaining amount is the above number.
if someone could help me out that would be great.
thanks.
