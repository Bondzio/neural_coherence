I'm attempting to use an Intellinet 150N usb adapter, but I'm getting nowhere. The wireless network is detected but I am unable to connect to it. After a few minutes I am told that the connection has &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. I am able to connect fine via my macbook. I'd be happy to provide any further necessary information, and I'd be grateful for any possible pointers. Thanks a lot, Thomas
