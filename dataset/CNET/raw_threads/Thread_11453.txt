I have a Linksys wireless router set up (WRT54G) and my PC desktop and laptop connect fine to the internet with wire and wireless. I installed an airport card in our Power Mac G4 but this cannot detect my wireless network. I have it connected now with an ethernet cable running through the kitchen but want to get rid of the cable. Is there a compatibility issue with airport and a Linksys wireless network? The Mac recognizes the airport card so I hope that means that it is good. (I got it from eBay used) This Mac is the farthest away from the router so I guess my next try is to see if I can move the router a little bit closer. I am a newbie to wireless so possibly I have a setting wrong. I did tell the router the mac addresses of all of the computers that I want to connect. Any advice? Thanks, Karen

Also the router is set for mixed mode and has been since I set it up. Also I read that cordless phones can interfere so I disconnected the cordless phone for a bit and still no luck. I tried changing the channel in the router and no luck.

I don't want to presume the obvious here, but if that card is working and everything is connected, it should at least &quot;see&quot; the wireless signal even the computer cannot join it. Satisfy my curiosity, check the antenna on that card, please P

I am not that advanced in networking yet. And mrmacfixit you were right about the antenna. The plug got knocked out when I shut the machine up after installing the card! BUT, after replugging the antenna it still is not recognizing any networks. Here is what I did yesterday. I brought my laptop to where the Mac is and it said the signal was very weak. It would not connect. So besides a possible airport card issue, I do have interference due to distance. Airport card - the instructions I got from Apple tech web site said to install the card serial number side up. I did that and it seems like the antenna should plug into the hole on the left side when the card is installed. There is also a hole on the right side but it is smaller and the antenna plug would not fit. So, did I pick the right spot to put the antenna? Next thing I will do is reseat the airport card tomorrow or Saturday and test again. Then, Monday I will move my DSL modem and the router to the phone jack closer to where the Mac is and see if it picks up a signal then. I can't do this until Monday since I am on call for work and can't disrupt my working network in case I am called for an issue. Thank you for all of your suggestions. I am determined to get this network working! Karen in CT

II for one of them and I for the other. The hole for the antenna is the one with the I next to it. Thats the one on the left, as the Apple guy said, when the card is serial number side up. The antenna is a really good fit in that hole. I spent a long time trying to figure out a nice way to ask about the antenna. No offense intended Good luck. P

I have 4 xp windows machines, that work with the same password. Then I read macs need a $ before the wep code, still wrong password. So I called linksys they cant help with a mac but said apple could. Well its late and I am tired. So they said I would have to do it by way of static, I am a newbie to macs and dont know how to do it.

To connect Mac OS X to a third-party wireless access point that is configured to use WEP, format your password one of these two ways: 1. Hexadecimal - precede the string with a dollar sign ($). For example: $123456789a 2. ASCII - enclose the characters in double quotes (&quot;). For example: &quot;magic&quot; See what happens. Whichever way you do it, you MUST know the correct password for the Linksys device P

Might be better if you started a new thread with all the details so that we can try to help you. Again, the internal modem is for a telephone line only P
