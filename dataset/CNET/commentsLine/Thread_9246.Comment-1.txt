i am going to be running boot camp on my mac and i am running out of space on my hard drive.
i don't want to partition too much or too little space (and i'm running out of storage in general) so i decided that it would be nice to run games off an external hard drive.
i plan on using an esata drive and i plan on running games such as left 4 dead, enemy territory: quake wars, half life 2, ut3.
essentially, the newest games (except half life 2).
would an esata drive be fast enough?
would i need to modify the external hard drive in any way?
is it even possible to run games of and external hd?
thanks in advance.
