I was thinking of buying a 60 dollar new AMD XP 2000 or 2200 and putting it in place of my current t-bird. Nowadays they run pretty cheap (60 or so). Is it worth it since my ram is so slow? WOuld this be an easy install? Ive never done a processor replacement but I've done pretty much everything else. Thanks!

I would disagree with the videocard statement...as it is still well above the requirements for the very latest games and usually on par with the recommended specs. The 4200 is the most efficient of the geforce 4s and runs better than a fx5200

For &quot;today's&quot; games, this one is dated. Look at the test results. I should address the CPU on SDRAM. Yes, an over 2GHz CPU would benchmark poorly with SDRAM. It's much like a boat anchor or drag chute on such a CPU's performance. Bob

Would an xp2000 be dragged down significantly by the ram? Also, how easy is it to replace the processor/heatsink Thanks!

So, the CPU upgrade is not possible. However, by chance if yours is 8KTA3+ PRO revision 1.0 (and not 0.1), it is possible.

I have some P4 1.9 GHz that is on an i845 chipset and SDRAM and it benchmarks about the same as the 800 to 1200 MHz speed of a P4. It's a big deal. 2. I think it's easy work. Bob
