select a folder to share on the xp machine, say my documents, and share it.
go to the mac and &quot;connect to server&quot; and you should see the xp machine there.
double click, enter the username of the xp user and the password and it should just connect.
i connect to a w2k machine with no problem.
hope this helps too p
