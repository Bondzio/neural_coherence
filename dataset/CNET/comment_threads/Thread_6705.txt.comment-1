Hi, I just bought an Emachine T6212.
It came with 512 mb ram, (2x256).
I realize that 128mb of that is shared video ram, so I just ordered 2x512 corsair value select ram from Newegg.
I read on another topic that it is suggested that the original ram be put in the current empty slots and the newer, larger ram be moved to the first 2 slots.
Can anyone help me out and tell me if this is true and why it is true?
?
