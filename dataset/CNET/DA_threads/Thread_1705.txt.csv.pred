1.1.1	OK I need some help .	St
1.1.2	I purchased an amped wireless SR150 so I can connect my Blue Ray Player ( hard wired only ) to my network so I could watch netflix , vudu etc ... issue is it lags way too much .	St
1.1.3	talked to amped wireless and they told me I need to upgrade to an extender with a larger range , my router is in the basement , TV/blue ray on the main floor..after doing some research I am thinking about the power line adapters .	St
1.1.4	Which way should I go ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do n't want to make another trip to the store ... .	St
1.2.1	All WiFi links are subject to interference and 802.11n has only 2 channels that do n't overlap - & gt ; http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels so you can imagine that any neighbor has a 50/50 chance of messing up your connection speed .	St
1.2.2	Power line works well but be sure to talk to them about the limitation such as both outlets must be on the same side of the power system .	St
1.2.3	I 'll stop here as I will duplicate the web .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob I guess more information is needed , tried a wired connection , originally I had my cable modem/wireless on the main floor next to by Blue Ray Player .	St
1.3.2	Purchased a 50ft Cat5E cable so my son can play xbox in the basement ... It did not work , I moved the modem down to the basement plugged in a shorter cable and the xbox worked , so it had to be the cable , if I do that again with the blue ray player I am afraid the same thing will happen even though I know 50ft is well within the specifications of CAT5e .	St
1.3.3	Plus I do n't really want to run a cable that long ( kind of a pain ) if you know what I mean	St
1.4.1	Ouch .	St
1.4.2	Too many discussions about that .	St
1.4.3	The cable should have been fine .	St
1.4.4	However without testing it wired ( my brother does this work ) the client is never sure if more wifi gear is the answer .	St
1.4.5	Why ?	Ques
1.4.6	Well on the new Smart TV and players there is a lot more lag than what you see on a common PC .	St
1.4.7	I 'm finding folk compare the response times on the TV to their PC .	St
1.4.8	bob	St
1.5.1	I am not comparing to a PC , I mean it hangs and hangs , to the point where I have to stop a movie , wait 5 minutes start it again then it lags again .	St
1.5.2	Netflix Signal drops to under 1mbps ... .As for the cable , it was the cable at least as far as the Xbox was concerned ... .It did work on my laptop , but not on the Xbox ... ..was a speed issue ... or a cable quality issue , one of the two .	St
1.5.3	I suppose I could return the extender and buy a cable and see what happens ... .although a wireless solution would be easier and less work ... .	St
1.6.1	I 'm beginning to wonder if there is a setup issue .	St
1.6.2	That is , I ca n't tell if the modem is just a modem or one of those combo modem+router things .	St
1.6.3	If it 's the combo deal setup needs to be checked .	St
1.6.4	I see a diagram but no words on settings .	St
1.6.5	Also only a few part numbers so I ca n't check it out .	St
1.6.6	If the modem is the usual , you no longer plug it into the WAN or Internet port of the router .	St
1.6.7	But I 'm getting ahead of myself .	St
1.6.8	- & gt ; As to the basement , my brother and the office will not warrant any router in the basement work .	St
1.6.9	You know why .	St
1.6.10	Bob	St
1.7.1	Bob It is a Combo Time Warner Router/Modem and the settings are fine .	St
1.7.2	It is a motorola 2.4ghz modem .	St
1.7.3	Think the first step I am going to do is get a better router and turn the wifi off on the time warner box , I know its a cheap pos ... .then perhaps go buy the longer cable ... .see if that works	St
1.8.1	If the combo is setup like normal , if you find a connection to the WAN Internet port of the router you have a double NAT .	St
1.8.2	Sorry but why ca n't we check the setup ?	Ques
1.8.3	Bob	St
