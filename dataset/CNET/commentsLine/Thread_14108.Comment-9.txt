however, the most efficient (coolest) quietest air coolers are not small.
and by selecting those units with good mounting kits, installing them properly and careful handling thereafter (don't drop the case hard causing the hsf to shift or dislodge), the medium to large air hsfs do an outstanding job without spending $70.
