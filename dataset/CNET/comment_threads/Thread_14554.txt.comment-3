I think you misunderstand me.
My computer is not sluggish nor does it have a virus.
What I have is a hardware issue that I can't seem to pinpoint and I was wondering if there is a software out there that can assist with locating the hardware problem ( so that it can test the sound card, graphics card, memory, HD, CD Rom, Floppy, and anything else).
Thanks.
