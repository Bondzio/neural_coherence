<s> I recently bought an 80gb Zune. </s>
<s> Using my old ipod's plug that connects the Zune to a TV, I attempted to connect the Zune to a friend's TV. </s>
<s> However, it did not work and I lost ALL of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad. </s>
<s> The play/pause and back buttons work fine. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, I cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back, and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission. </s>
<s> Is there any software I can download to refresh the Zune? </s>
<s> Additionally is there any other way to manually reset it? </s>
<s> I've held down the play/pause button many times and the Zune software is up to date. </s>
<s> Call it in and see where they want you to send it. </s>
<s> If this is a recent purchase, do call the support or repair side of Zune. </s>
<s> Pssst... </s>
<s> I wouldn't mention you used a non-Zune(non-compatible) cable with it and the problem appeared. </s>
<s> Afterall, I suspect the Zune and iPod cables are different at least *assume* they're not interchangeable. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
