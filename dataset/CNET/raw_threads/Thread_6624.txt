I would recommend a downgrade of the RAM from 4gb down to 3gb (Windows 32bit can only use a maximum of 3.3 gb). And I noticed that you're &quot;upgrading&quot; from the original 3gb that runs at 800Mhz, the 3gb at 800Mhz is more suitable for gaming. Also, keep in mind though, that there have been numerous Dell threads that talk about how the eSATA port doesn't work. It's fixable, but the current solution is a complete clean reinstall of Vista. If that's not a huge problem for you, then this deal definitely looks really sweet.

14305	4	279707	2678290	2678120	vr4falife	1/13/08 12:17 PM	1.20022662E12	sounds good	yeah the eSATA isn't really a big deal for me. So i should just get it with the 3gb then huh? im down for that too. I really wanted this to be available with XP too. I've heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista. Is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42&quot; HDTV with this machine? if so what else would i need?

I remember reading that somewhere a long time ago. Anybody know if i right or wrong? As you can probably tell im not really great at computers.
