<s> Hi all My Dell Dimensions 8200 (6 yrs old) has a 64MB NVidia TI4200 - it appears to have died - diagnostic lights on back of PC indicate issue with graphics card and get no signal to screen. </s>
<s> (tried re-seating it several times) Looking for a replacement agp card - any suggestions - there don't seem to be many around these days and don't want to have to mess with changing power supply etc.. another question Can I use a PCI card instead - would the PC boot up if I used one in place of an AGP type? </s>
<s> thanks PC Dell 8200 Windows XP 256MB memory </s>
<s> here's a $40 geforce fx5500: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SF8834F5F2T256DT&cat=VCD a PCI card will work but won't be any cheaper. </s>
<s> thanks for the link - that's a 256MB card - would there be any issues as it's replacing a 64MB one? </s>
<s> The reason I mentioned the PCI type was in case it was the actual agp slot that was busted. </s>
<s> I just want to get PC back up and running until I can replace the PC with something current </s>
<s> After some digging I came up with a few choices. </s>
<s> Ati radeon x800gt x700 x600 geforce 6600, 6600gt After looking at the specs, I believe the geforce 6600 is it. </s>
<s> Better bandwidth, HDR. </s>
<s> and it should work with the axisting psu. </s>
<s> Just look for AGP 8x or 4x cards. </s>
<s> Thanks for the list of cards, really appreciate that you took the time. </s>

<s> I should stick with a 4x AGP. </s>
<s> I really just want a card to get system back up and running, will be replacing it at some point </s>
<s> The 8X AGP card falls back to 1, 2, 4X based on what the socket tells it to do. </s>
<s> And if the card is totally incompatible it won't plug in. </s>
<s> OK thanks </s>
