<s> I need to replace my 6 yr old printer because Dell does not provide Win7 drivers for it. </s>
<s> I have been wanting to upgrade anyway, as the cost for cartridges for most of the printing I do was way too high. </s>
<s> This is for home use, max two users. </s>
<s> I print mostly text documents and PDFs, so have little need for color on a daily basis. </s>
<s> I would like the ability to print in color as well as copy and scan. </s>
<s> I am thinking of buying two printers: a relatively inexpensive monochrome laser for lower cost per page and fasterprint speed over inkjet &amp; AIO inkjet for copy and scan functions as well as occasional color printing. </s>
<s> Here are the attributes I would like for each printer: Laser: The goal with this printer would be to keep the cost per page printed as low as possible. </s>
<s> This printer would be used for light daily printing of text files. </s>
<s> These are mostly scientific articles(5-30 pages) that I highlight as I read and then either file away or recycle bin (I am trying to transfer to an ereader but I still prefer paper). </s>
<s> Decent speed &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot; style=&quot;white-space:pre&quot;&gt; -not overly concerned with quality Easy double sided printing Wireless printing if possible $100-150 range Inkjet AIO: Goal with this printer would be to cover the few color printing jobs I have(no photos). </s>
<s> Good print and copy speed would be nice but I am ok with slow as long as quality is not horrible. </s>
<s> If I need excellent print quality I have easy access to a professional printer service.Preference would be given to models with good to excellent scan quality. </s>
<s> Wireless printing(would give it up given cost) $100-150 range Does this scenario make sense for me or anyone? </s>
<s> Are there decent quality AIO inkjets out there with low enough cost per page B&amp;W printing and good enough speed to forgo the laser printer? </s>
<s> Target price range for this one would be as low as possible but as high as $200ish. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> I tried to search the forum for an answer to my question prior to posting but obviously I missed that one. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> If you have a clear understanding of your printing needs rather than desires, buy the printer(s) that best benefit you in the long run. </s>
<s> IMHO, many don't need color for day-to-day printing especially in draft mode of simple text, that's where laser shine, plus being quick at it. </s>
<s> Color is best for presentation or final output if needed. </s>
<s> If you decide too heavily on cost alone, that may hinder you if your needs expand or want more than what's offered. </s>
<s> Your wish for an AIO maybe better served by a plain color printer since what a AIO is more than printing alone, so decide which you want. </s>
<s> I think w/o too much doubt having the mono-laser, even a cheap one would suffice for typical needs as your stated. </s>
<s> Though, you may want to review toner costs. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I started leaning toward not getting a color printer after I posted on Sun. </s>
<s> Now on to checking toner costs! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
