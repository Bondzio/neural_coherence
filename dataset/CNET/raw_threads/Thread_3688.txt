Do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer? Any recommendations on a model. I've seen different reports on Motorola's SBG900 and SBG1000. I need to hook up my existing modem via USB rather than Ethernet. Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router. Thanks Steve Rehmann

The built in router if a &quot;G&quot; type will run at close to 54mbps. Add a wireless &quot;B&quot; device and the speeds drop to 11mbps. Not having to run CAT5 cable is the main advantage in going 802.11x. &quot;Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.&quot; I would think not.

I am stuck with the USB connection to my desktop. I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working. My ISP (Mediacom) and I troubleshot. We ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different PCI slots to no avail. When we switched to the USB it connected right away. I am not disapointed with the speed or performance. I would guess there is a setting or failure of some type at the computer as I can get the signal to the modem but not to the computer on the ethernet side. Are you saying that a wireless cable modem &quot;combo&quot; would be a route to go if it has an ethernet side for a laptop. I am looking at a Motorola SBG900 wireless modem. It says it has a 802.11g wireless access point. My thoughts were that I could keep the desktop cabled to the modem as it has a USB connection on the rear. I thought that would eliminate the need for a wireless USB adaptor between the desktop and modem. I would then add the notebook as a wireless connection to the ethernet side of the modem. I'd end up with a physical cable connection from the modem to the desktop (USB) and a wireless connection from the laptop to the modem (ethernet??) Am I on the right track. Steve Rehmann

The troublesome statement is: &quot;I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working. My ISP (Mediacom) and I troubleshot. We ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different PCI slots to no avail. When we switched to the USB it connected right away.&quot; This indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware/software or the modem. The prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral/spyware/malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you.

Will also use Registry Mechanic to clean registry. I am running XP SP2, 512 RAM, AMD Athlon XP 1.47G. Harware includes a Motorola SB4200 modem, logitech wireless mouse and keyboard, Xtasy 9200SE 128MB video card, Audixy SX USB sound card, Creative TV card, and a Pinnicle video capture card. I have 5 USB ports in the rear and all are full. 2 up front are used infrequently. 2 firewire ports are on the same PCI card that has the 3 USB ports. Ehternet card is a D-Link DFE-530TX+ So what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem?? Thanks

The ethernet standard (802.3) is primarily used with CAT5 cabling, while a wireless connection (802.11) is just that.
