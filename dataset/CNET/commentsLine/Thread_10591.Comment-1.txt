i have been looking for a 19 inch lcd monitor but i am finding that the ones i am trying have a tendency to give off a fuzzy (slight crosshatch) pattern when there is movement on the screen (such as in games or when i drag a window around the screen).
does anyone have any idea what this is that i am seeing?
to my eyes, it appears as a small criss cross pattern that really is noticeable to me.
any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
