1.1.1	I 'm planing to buy a 3G router for my MTS Datacard ( 3.1Mbps ) .I would like to know if it supports my ZTE AC 2766 Modem ( MTS Mblaze ) ( India ) or can you suggest me other routers which may be compatible.I need to share my internet connection to my android phone , printer , PC and Laptop.I 've checked some of the brands like Edimax-6128n , Iball-3g+Wi Fi , Tenda , Tp-link routers but I 'm confused as to which to buy and which is compatible .	St
1.2.1	It 's pretty simple .	St
1.2.2	Ask the seller for their refund and support policy .	St
1.2.3	If you did select your USB stick then find the router and check it 's compatibility list .	St
1.2.4	Since you have this stick info and you are in the country where this is used , your research should go much faster than mine .	St

1.4.1	Hi , I asked the dealer whether My MTS datacard ( http : //mtsindia.in/Karnataka/netonthego.html ) is compatible they said that since I 'm using a 2g dongle ( 3.1Mbps ) they said that it s better if I have a 3G dongle as the Asus 3G ( http : //in.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/WL330N3G/ ) router is designed to give better performance for 3g dongles only , now I do not understand what they r saying is it so that if I use dongles other than 3G the net speed would be a bit less than if i directly connect my mts dongle to my PC , could you please help .
