<s> OK, so I have this new state of the art computer, and somewhat older HP 40 (all in one) printer. </s>
<s> When I first connected the printer to the computer everything was OK. After several days, I cannot print anything from a web site. </s>
<s> If I pay a bill and I want to print the confirmation, I get an error message. </s>
<s> If I copy the confirmation and paste it to Word, I still cannot print it until I do a reboot. </s>
<s> This happens everytime. </s>
<s> Is it something to do with pop up blockers? </s>
<s> I am lost and don't know what to do. </s>
<s> I have the same pop up blocker I had with my older computer and ha never had this issue. </s>
<s> This is a XP Professional OS, while my ols one was Windows 98. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>

<s> Anything else I can try please? </s>
<s> I am hardware technical engineer for HP All in one printers providing technical trouble shooting steps through chat support. </s>
<s> OK, so what do you reckon the problem is? </s>
<s> I uninstalled and re-installed the printer and on the first go it seems to have worked. </s>
<s> However, in the past also whenever I did something like this it worked the first time and then it was not able to print any longer. </s>
