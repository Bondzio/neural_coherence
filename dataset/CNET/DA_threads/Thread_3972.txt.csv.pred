1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Full of surprises.	St
1.2.2	Your IT classes may not require you to need much more than a machine with a web browser and not much else.	St
1.2.3	IT covers such a wide range of topics but today you might get by with a web browser, google docs and mail.	St
1.2.4	So the need for large storage and video cards might be for playing games, and not about the college work.	St
