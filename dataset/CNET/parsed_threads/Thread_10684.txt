<s> I have recently bought a sharp LC20B6E Lcd tv with pc input. </s>
<s> i have no problems using it with my pc but whenever i try to play a game just as it loads up the screen goes blank and the message &quot;please check pc input&quot; appears. </s>
<s> I have tried changing resolutions but this has no effect and i know there can be problems playing pc games on a lcd tv, but is there any way round this? </s>
<s> thanks for an help or suggestions! </s>
<s> Maybe you use Windows, but it's not evident. </s>
<s> Try this if you do. </s>
<s> Run DXDIAG. </s>
<s> On the rightmost tab, click it then in the OVERRIDE setting change it to 60. best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> i tried that but didn't work. </s>
<s> i have read in the manual for the tv that you may have to switch to external output on the pc to view certain images. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem? </s>
<s> how would you do it? </s>
<s> Not a word about your PC. </s>
<s> Not even a confirmation it runs Windows. </s>
<s> Why so few words? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry yes i run on windows xp, did not think that it was important, what else do you need to know? </s>
<s> also when am in the direct x diagnostic tool (DXDIAG) and test direct draw and direct 3d they work apart from when it tests it full screen then the screen goes blank with check pc input signal </s>
<s> I was being as subtle as I could to ask for additional clues. </s>
<s> But sorry to hear it can't be told. </s>
<s> With every post you make the following is asked so I don't have to. </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> My bet is the video mode called up by the game is beyond the capability of the display, but without details I can't offer any help. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> thanks bob but maybe i will have to get help somewhere else. </s>
<s> why do you need to know my system info. </s>
<s> the computer plays the games fine but it is the screen which has the problem with any type of game. </s>
<s> What they are to work on. </s>
<s> If you blindfold me, I can't see what I'm working on. </s>
<s> Hey, that's your choice but be prepared to get flames on some boards if you try that. </s>
<s> &quot;why do you need to know my system info. </s>
<s> the computer plays the games fine but it is the screen which has the problem with any type of game.&quot; For example some video cards have tools to limit video modes, some games have settings you need to tinker with. </s>
<s> -&gt; Your discussion has many replies now but you didn't reveal the details and the discussion is now about why the details are needed. </s>
