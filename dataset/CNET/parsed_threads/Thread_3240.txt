<s> I am running windows XP professional on an ASUS P4T motherboard with 2Gb rdram and 1.8 MHz Pentium 4 processor. </s>
<s> My sound card is a Creative Audigy live. </s>
<s> My graphics card is an ATI All In Wonder 7500. </s>
<s> I have downloaded all the latest drivers and updates for all my hardware and the operating system Here is my problem and it is driving me crazy!!! </s>
<s> When I play the TV on the computer the video and sound are out of sink (the sound and video play at different times like a poorly dubbed karate movie). </s>
<s> The graphics card uses the sound cards input to play sound through a cable connecting both cards. </s>
<s> Another weird thing is that my system keeps muting the input volume by itself as though resetting itself. </s>
<s> I hope it is just a configuration issue but I am clueless. </s>
<s> i'm assuming this is recorded tv. </s>
<s> if so, the mpeg recording could be overtaxing your cpu. </s>
<s> unfortunately, the all in wonder series is discontinued. </s>
<s> if you're using it for tv tuning/recording, you should dial back it recording quality. </s>
<s> if you have a seperate tv tuner, a new video card with hardware assisted mpeg playback could help. </s>
<s> look for a radeon x1000 or geforce 7000/8000 series video card. </s>
<s> Actually it is live TV that does this, weird huh. </s>
<s> I got rid of XP and went back to 2000 and everything works fine now so I guess I am just stuck with an older operating system. </s>
