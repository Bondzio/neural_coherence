Seems she want to keep it but he's talked her into upgrading the machine. I've made several suggestions that should occur such as a new power supply and HDD along with a new MoBo, memory and CPU. The specs are a 200Mhz bus and she has a 900Mhz AMD duron chip. I'm not finding much on the MoBo online. I suppose it's just too old. The husband and I are not in the same location as the computer, so I have no means to &quot;climb inside&quot; and take a look. I feel it's safest to ensure the new board is the same size as the old one and the holes line up to mount the thing. Does anyone have any suggestions on boards? I've tried endlessly to talk them both into buying a new computer, but that has fallen on deaf ears. Suggestions on boards anyone?

(buy one with embedded sound and video) with new CPU and memory, combined with a new PSU and a new hard disk, in essence is a new PC in an old case. Why not add a DVD-burner to replace the CD-ROM? Then all is new! It might be cheaper to buy everything new, including the case, if you can get a nice deal. And it certainly is less work. Kees

Consider a ram upgrade. Waste of money in my opinion...but it might make the user happy. HP says that machine comes with 128MB of ram with a max of 768MB. If the user is running w98 bump the ram to 256. If the user is running XP bump the ram to the max.

I have no clue what the board is inside, but I can't make a suggestion to my colleague without know what's inside the case. Any ideas?

I am guessing that the lady in question has become very familiar with her Presario. She knows where her files are, she knows how to plug her camera and mp3 player into it, she nows how to install a new CD program into it. SHE KNOWS IT. That is why she wants to keep it. Upgrading it is NOT a waste of time or money. As a matter of fact her machine will do pretty much everything a new one will. It can download off the internet at 100MPS if she likes. It can send email. It can display photo ablums, it can play cds and mp3s. It can display in svga. It can accept a DVD burner. Will XPsp2/3 with all of its heavy and burdeonsome network interfacing, security for such, and background services, most of which she will NEVER use, be slower on her machine? Sure. Will Vista with its shiny display but ram killing requirements be more than her system can handle? Undoubtedly. But so what. I don't put a Ferrari v12 in my Honda because I'm not racing in a Grand Prix. As a matter of fact, most of the users here that have high end machines will admit they do so primarily to PLAY GAMES. Maybe she has other games she plays besides those on a computer (soccer with kids, candyland with pre-schooler, etc...) Max out the Ram. Find a decent graphics card. Max out the CPU for its socket type. All three won't cost maybe $175.00 total. Double check HP\Compaq's site info against the motherboard's own site. I have found several discrepancies in the past, especially with FIC produced boards. A good air clean for the power supply, maybe add a system case fan, and perhaps drop &quot;themes&quot; setting to a performance stance from appearance, and her husband gets his upgrades, she keeps her computer, they stay married!

Use the scheduled tasks to automate computer maintenance and software upgrades for her machine. The casual computer user (i.e. email, photos, mp3, websurf-casts, and solitaire) believe their machine to be slower than it used to be, or perhaps slower than the one their friend has, because it is broken or infected. In fact, most often it needs only to have its scheduled tasks set up to self maintain the HDD, Registry, and Antivirus protocols.
