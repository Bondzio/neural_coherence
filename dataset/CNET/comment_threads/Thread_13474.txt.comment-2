not really, if you're using XP.
google a program called &quot;smartclose&quot;: it lets you shut down everything that can be shut down and still run windows environment, which you need for games (i play WoW, and had all kinds of lag before finding this program.
was going into task manager and shutting things down one at a time.
pain in the butt.)
hope this helps
