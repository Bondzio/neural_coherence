ive done much research on both.
i am leaning towards emachines because of the built in tuner...can anyone tell me what brand it is and the quality?
if its total garbage i can get the hp.
also is there the ability to add another dvd drive if you choose in the emachines?
i am concerned over emachines qulaity vs hp....any feedback would be appreciated.
