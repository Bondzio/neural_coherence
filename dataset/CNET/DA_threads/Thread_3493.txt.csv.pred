1.1.1	I bought a WD SATA drive for an old laptop.	St
1.1.2	Turns out it was the wrong kind of drive so I got a USB enclosure for it so it could be used as a storage drive for my newer laptop, an HP Pavilion DV9000 running Vista.	St
1.1.3	I have the drivers installed.	St
1.1.4	I formated it and the device manager recognizes it's there and working properly.	St
1.1.5	However, I rarely get it to show up in my explorer window.	St
1.1.6	When it does show up, I can't add anything to the drive.	St
1.1.7	How do I get this thing to work?	St
1.2.1	Unplug that drive.	St
1.2.2	Ponder if you need to listen to Grif at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6121_102-0.html?forumID=45&threadID=318877&messageID=2920485&tag=forums06;posts#2920485 But for now please install AUTORUN EATER just in case.	St
