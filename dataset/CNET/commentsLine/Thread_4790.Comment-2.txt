cat5 or ethernet twisted pairs don't use the old terminators we used on old 50 ohm coax (tees, terminators, oh my!)
but about that new router.
if you do this, do not plug it into the wan port.
use any lan port then configure it as a wap.
google this -&gt; how to use a router as a wap?
now with that out of the way you get 2 wifi channels (yup, 2) as noted at  for 802.11n so set one for 3 and the other as noted in the article.
that should do it.
and a setup i have done and endorse.
