I finally found and corrected the problem.
It seems there was an intermittently defective IDE cable.
I replaced the IDE cable and everything works perfectly now.
The drives are autodetected normally in BIOS and no more problems.
Simply replacing the old cable with a new one did the trick.
Thanks for all the responses and suggestions.
Jim
