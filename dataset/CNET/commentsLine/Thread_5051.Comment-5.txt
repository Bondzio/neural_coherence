i don't like fixing my friend's computers that have suffered such damage since the unit could decide to turn into a brick just by removing the case.
it's suffered some hard times but still works.
until you are sure they are ok with getting a brick back i'd leave it alone.
plus if you do, why open it unless you have the spare parts to put in?
