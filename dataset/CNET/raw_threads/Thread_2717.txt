Memory Size 1024MB Memory Speed 533 MHz PC4200 Memory Type DDR2 Pins 240 Can my system accept and operate efficiently with the 1G PC 4200???

Two thiongs buy from relable place such as newegg, get lifetime warranty. Go to the computer mfr's website to see if they have data on memory that they have qualified for that system. Unfortunatley your proprietary vendor may not do that because he wants to sell you his at double the price. Newegg warranty is to replace with like item, however, if necessary they will allow an RMA for a full refund if talked to nicely. And if you want to buy a higher priced item Have done that by starting the RMA, buying the new one and eventually getting credit for the returned item. They process such transactions rather smoothly, no BS.

I told the salesperson who had called me that I had found a source. She confirmed the compatibility and that I could add the two in the empty slots alongside the 2 - 512MB it was compatible, as did Ray H in this forum. The cost of purchasing it was about 1/2 of what HP would have charged. I am getting the 2 - 1G modules from Amazon/Tiger Direct...

When I bought the memory for my HP a1020n, The best deal was NewEgg, bt deals change regularly. You are getting the 1GB strips for about what I paid for the 512 that I bought.
