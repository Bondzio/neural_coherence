It was a picture from some app called Pocket Booth. I should have known it was going to be trouble because I had to click download several times and it wouldn't open. Little did I know it actually had downloaded everytime. Anyway, I saw the picture several times in my downloads folder and deleted them all. Several weeks later, I started having issues with the camera and other apps because the phone claimed that my SD card was full. It's 8 GB, but I've only had the phone for a few months so it couldn't be possible. I went to the downloads and saw that there were more than 5000 items! The majority of them was this picture that had been copied over and over. I deleted them. The next week I had 1200+ files in there--all this picture that won't go away! I've tried mounting the phone to the computer and deleting them from there, but that does work. What gives?
