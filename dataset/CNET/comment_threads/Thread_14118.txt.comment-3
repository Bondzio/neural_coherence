The only thing I can think of that I did wrong is put the fan that sits over the CPU heatsink wrong (never took the heatsink out), but It's still sitting over it doing it's job, I just twisted it one more space than was supposed to.
The graphics card is out-dated so no power connectors.
I'll try with only 1 stick of RAM and post again and post back in a few minutes.
