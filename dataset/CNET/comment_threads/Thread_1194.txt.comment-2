It sounds like a power issue to me.
Do you have a surge protector between the computer and the wall outlet?
You may want to try a UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) to see if you are getting voltage dips/spikes.
If you do get a UPS, make sure the voltage rating is sufficient for your computer and don't plug your printer, especially laser printers, into it.
If that doesn't remedy the problem, you have either a faulty power supply or mobo.
