Acer acquired Gateway which brought eMachine, so the whole idea of a decent system seems remote.
But, the fact remains the Acer brand itself has been pretty good.
It never was a big seller and that alone accounts for the quality of the brand as sloppiness didn't get passed on in mass productions numbers.
Support is there but once the warranty date is reached it becomes harder and you pay if dealing with Acer.
The same for any other brand, but Acer really draws the line.
