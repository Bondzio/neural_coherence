<s> I am creating a new system with a Chaintech 478 board 3.06 cpu, it has 2 Promise raid slots on it, I am not planning to use 2 drives, But can I hook up a single drive to one, or wll I need to install a PCI card (which I have) to run it. </s>
<s> I have all the other ide's used up with the main drive and zip cd dvd&lt; I wish to hook up my old drive from this system, to download the programs and files I want to keep. </s>
<s> The paperwork doesnot say if you can hook up a cd or zip? </s>

<s> You can usually select these ports to operate as standard IDE ports for hard drives but not ATAPI devices such as CD ROMs, ZIPs, etc. </s>
<s> Your best bet is to find a manual to confirm this, however. </s>
<s> If you can add a single drive, you will find a change in the BIOS necessary. </s>
<s> I have an ASUS board with a RAID controller that works either way but, again, no ATAPIs allowed. </s>
