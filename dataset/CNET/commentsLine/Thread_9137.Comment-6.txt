hey ray, so you think it's not the video card because the monitor displayed that message?
i don't know what else to do.
i know you've offered for me to send it to you, but i don't have the ways to send it and i don't trust how ups/fedex treat their packages (since i worked with ups, i'd know!, lol!)
i guess i'll have to find a local shop that is willing to check it out for me for free or something.
if you can think of anything else, let me know.
thanks
