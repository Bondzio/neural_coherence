I am a digital photographer with a dye based modified Epson 1280 loaded with expensive quad tone ink.
I also have a new Epson Stylus R1800 for color photo printing.
I hate to print text in business letters, web pages, web receits with these.
I want a low maintenance printer that I can use only ocassionally that won't clog up to print text with.
I want the text quality to be excellent.
Any suggestions?
