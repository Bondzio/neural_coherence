hello folks, i have been researching superdrives for my jan 2008 a1181 dual core.
there seem to be 3 main compatable models; gsas10n, uj-857c, and uj-867a.
i know they must be capped at 8xdvd and i want dual layer ability.
the uj867a by panasonic seems to fit what i want.
here are my 2 ?s.
1. is the panasonic 867a (nov 2010) 9.5mm the best choice?
2. sata or pata?
i know sata is a bit faster but is that what's in there already?
the 2010 new super i am looking at is pata, is the current optical a sata?
and should i just try to find a sata uj-857c in good shape?
i know somewhere someone has already asked smthg similar but by page 20 and the cnet search yielded no answers.
thank you for any help!
