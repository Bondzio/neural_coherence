1.1.1	Hello, This computer seen to be running fine but when i select shutdown sometimes the computer does not shutdown it just looks like is going to but it shows a black screen after it cleared the desktop and the only thing i see is in the upper left corner is a dash blinking for a while, so i have to shutdown it from the switch button, the next time i will turn on the computer of course the scandisk run cause it did not shutdown correctly, i think it is a particular application that win98 does not have enough time to let this one to close, is there anything that i can check for to resolve this issue ?
