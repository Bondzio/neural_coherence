<s> Hi, I recently bought a headset with a microphone. </s>
<s> Unfortunately it's not USB and had two connections at the end, a light pink one, and a light green. </s>
<s> I've plugged them both into the back of the PC, the sound works fine but the microphone doesn't work. </s>
<s> Sound Recorder states that another program is recording, and that I should switch it off. </s>
<s> And the test for the microphone records nothing. </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> Whats wrong? </s>
<s> My second problem is, I connected my broadband connection to my older PC. </s>
<s> It works fine but when I try to share printers. </s>
<s> Mine isn't in the list. </s>
<s> (I clicked Control Panel/Printers/Add Printer/Network) A Canon BJC 2100. </s>
<s> My printer is connected to a Windows XP machine and my older PC is Windows ME. </s>
<s> Any ideas..? </s>
<s> You have to install the printer on all machines that will use it. </s>
<s> Even though it's shared, the machine printing has to know what it is. </s>
<s> Then the print job is sent across the network to the printer. </s>
<s> Right ok, thanks.. </s>
<s> I think it's fixed now, does anyone have a solution to my evil headset problem? </s>
<s> Oh, nevermind, it turned out my sound cards properties muted the microphone. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help anyway </s>
