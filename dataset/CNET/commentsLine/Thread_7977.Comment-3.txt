hi hyghwayman, i work for hp and saw your message and want to help if i can.
tip: one thing you can do to shutdown your pc without unplugging it is to press and hold down the power button for 5 seconds.
i'm trying to better understand your problem.
did this just start happening?
did it occur after installing any hardware or software, even a windows update?
you might want to try updating your bios:  this hp support document looks like it may help:  it could also be that your pc is overheating.
perhaps it needs to be cleaned?
i hope this helps.
let us know how it goes.
--although i am an hp employee, i am speaking for myself and not for hp.--
