If I replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast. Could it be... The slow cables are not in the 568-B nor in the 568-A order. They are crimped the same on both ends though. Example. Orange White/Orange Green White/Green Brown White/Brown Blue White/Blue The reason I came to this conclusion is the &quot;pairs&quot; are twisted, and if If the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something? Can anyone explain.

This would still be a straight through cable. Examine the printing on the cable to determine the rated bandwidth/speed. Cat.3, Cat.5, Cat.5e, Cat.6?
