i wish i'd read your comments a year and a half ago.
in february of 2012, i bought myself an asus eb121 tablet pc.
it is an ipad look alike that runs win7, has 4 gb of ram and has a 64gb ssd.
it is my secondary computer (i have a desktop i use most often with a single sata disk drive).
i do a lot of document editing (mostly story writing, powerpoints, and spreadsheets) so this is very relevant to me.
when i bought the computer, the sales person assured me that ssds are almost crash proof; practically no moving parts.
just to be clear, the salesperson did not talk me into buying the computer.
i had done my homework and chose it in advance.
so you're saying that ssds fail after x number of rewrites and therefore should not be used be people who do a lot of document writing?
as i said, i'm that kind of computer user.
for my most important files, i use dropbox for file synchronization anyway.
therefore, my files are automatically backed up.
however, that means that any file i put into dropbox automatically gets put onto my tablet's ssd.
that means that my tablet's ssd is being rewritten on for every critical and less than critical file.
