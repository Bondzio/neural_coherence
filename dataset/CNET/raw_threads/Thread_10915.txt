I want to play Left 4 Dead, but their is one problem. Vertex Shader Ver.: Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.1 Pixel Shader Ver.: Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.3 Can I run that game at all? I understand the game performance may be bad but I am willing to change some settings. So my question is, will the game even start up, even if I lower the settings? Thanks

Your Ti-4600 lacks these features and the game will not run on your PC. You will need a GeForce 6600 series or higher or Radeon 9600 series or higher video card. http://pc.ign.com/articles/923/923094p1.html
