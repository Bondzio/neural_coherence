<s> If you have other cd drives that work properly, and if you have a pci sound card, did you connect an audio cable from the back of the drive to the sound card? </s>

<s> If I recall correctly, this system has &quot;Integrated&quot; sound - which I thought was built into the MoBo. </s>

<s> On THIS drive? </s>

<s> Yes - this new DVD drive plays audio disks fine. </s>
<s> But when I pop in a movie disk, great video but no sound. </s>
<s> I have made sure that the mute button on the player is unchecked, and I can't find any other settings that might be causing this. </s>
<s> It could be the lack of some codec that's required for the dvd. </s>
<s> You can download and install the Nimo Codec Pack here: http://nimo.titanesk.com/modules/freecontent/index.php?id=1 </s>
<s> Double-click on the volume icon next to your clock. </s>
<s> This will bring up a whole bunch of volume settings. </s>
<s> Make sure the &quot;Wave&quot; sound source Mute box is UNCHECKED and its volume is up. </s>
<s> (If there is no Volume icon next to your clock, go to the &quot;Sounds and Audio Devices&quot; control panel, click on the &quot;Volume&quot; tab, and and click &quot;Advanced&quot;.) </s>
<s> To make it simple, you might want to UNCHECK all Mute boxes and turn up all volumes, to cover all sources. </s>
<s> Also, if you installed a retail version of a DVD drive, there should be a port for a 3 or 4 pin audio cable in the back of the drive. </s>
<s> The other end of the sound cable plugs into the motherboard (if you have motherboard integrated sound) or into your sound card (if you have a PCI sound card). </s>
<s> After downloading an audio codec pack, I now have sound with the movies. </s>
<s> The volume seems low but it works. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Glad to hear it's working. </s>
<s> Check the volume level in control panel/sound and audio devices. </s>
<s> I have a similar problem with a new i/o magic DVD RW 16x. </s>
<s> OS Win2K. </s>
<s> (no audio connector required). </s>
<s> I also have an old DVD-ROM in the system (with same problems) It plays audio cd's, mp3s, and even a DVD created with the packaged nero6. </s>
<s> So, when I put in a commercial DVD... NO AUDIO. </s>
<s> I got one pop up about Dolby decoders, but unable to find a reference to this online. </s>
