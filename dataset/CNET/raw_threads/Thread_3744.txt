For example, I want to create www.nameofsite.com using the html files on my computer. Of course, I will have my computer on at all times. What are the process of me accomplishing this? Thank you.

If the domain name is available, you can then proceed and register that domain name. An example would be going to http://www.domainsatretail.com/domainreg.html . Load the site, and search for the name you want, and if its available register it. Note: .com domain names for a good price is $7.95 / year. Many charge more, but you can get it for the lower price and it will be the same. As far as it pointing to your html files on your computer, you would need to set your computer up as its own Web Server (host), and have the domain name point to your computers IP. Setting up a web server is not something I would advise if you are not understanding of how to do it. I would personally for the price, just get web hosting from the many web hosting companies out there. You can find hosting for as little as $4.95 / month, and they will help you set it all up and you will have less hassles. You can see at http://www.domainsatretail.com/webhosting.html the different packages you can get and purchase, and you set it up and are good to go. If you have any more questions, let me know.
