I have a quantum fire ball 30 gig hard drive. When I'm doing work especially when I'm online the computer beeps once and restarts at the same time. About a month ago the power supply burned out and I replaced it thinking that was the problem, but that is not the case. It's back to doing the same thing. Please help!!!!

Try opening the case and pointing a fan at the inside, heat build up might be the cause. And eyeball those internal fans while you are there.
