<s> I am trying to switch a SATA hard drive with windows xp on it, to a dell machine. </s>
<s> I hooked it up, but got a STOP 0x0000000b error (don't know if that's the exact number or not). </s>
<s> Now i read up and I think it means I need to install my dell hard drive drivers on the hard drive to use it and boot it, but how do I go about doing that? </s>
<s> If that's not right, and you know what is, it'd be great if your could help out. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Windows can't move from machine to machine. </s>
<s> You get to install it as you change motherboards and such. </s>
<s> And no. </s>
<s> You can't just install the Dell drivers. </s>
