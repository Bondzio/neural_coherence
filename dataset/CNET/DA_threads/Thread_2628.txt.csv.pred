1.2.1	There 's e-bay , but in your post you did n't raise the issue that you may want the battery to hold a charge ... Then , in a pinch I did find a battery rebuilder .	St
1.2.2	It was for a model that I could n't buy a battery for , so the 70 bucks was worth it .	St
1.2.3	In closing , your part of the world may not be like mine , so my lowest cost wo n't be yours .	St
1.2.4	So it 's up to you to search for such things in your neck of the woods .	St
