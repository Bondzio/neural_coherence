1.1.1	Hi Client of mine has got NAS LaCie d2 Network is installed on his LAN and it was mapped to a public ip address for an ADSL router.	St
1.1.2	Private ip address for NAS LaCie d2 Network is 192.168.10.50 and it is mapped to 87.67.x.x (not real WAN ip) with port 21 as can be seen below : http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=8x0745&s=3 From any remote location when I type in in a browser this ftp://87.67.x.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I can access the folder on the NAS LaCie d2 Networ as can be seen on the snapshot below : http://i25.tinypic.com/zuidsw.png Rather than driving to the clients site and access through his LAN, I need to access the NAS remotely to update few configuration.	St
1.1.3	How can I remotely access web interface for LaCie d2 Network?	St
1.1.4	I tried to read the documentation below but I could not locate the section that is related to what I am looking for http://www.lacie.com/download/manual/d2Network_en.pdf Thanks	St
1.2.1	Set up some remote access like VNC or even Windows Remote Desktop and then you can access it from there.	St
1.2.2	As to FTP, it appears you forgot port 20.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	&gt;&gt;Set up some remote access like VNC or even Windows Remote Desktop and then you can access it from there.&lt;&lt; This is one option to access it.But how can I access it as http if it is feasible ?	Ques
1.3.2	&gt;&gt;it appears you forgot port 20&lt;&lt; Yes I did not configure that ,,,,Do i need to configure that as well ?	Ques
1.3.3	right now it is working without port 20 has been configured.	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.	St
1.4.2	You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product.	Sug
1.4.3	As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?	St
1.4.4	Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP.	St
1.4.5	I don't need to write why but this and other common server ports are too often blocked.	St
1.4.6	This area is slamming a few out there.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi Bob &gt;&gt;I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.&lt;&lt; No this is not the case for me.	St
1.5.2	&gt;&gt;You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product&lt;&lt;.	Sug
1.5.3	What do mean I can try ?	Ques
1.5.4	could you please explain ?	Ques
1.5.5	&gt;&gt;As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?&lt;&lt; Yes I konw that port 20 is a data port on a server side.	St
1.5.6	When the client uses active mode, the server only needs to receive connections on port 21, so forwarding only port 21 is sufficient for that.	St
1.5.7	&gt;&gt;Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP&lt;&lt; This is also not my case.	St
1.6.1	I think we're done.	St
1.6.2	I offered the most common workaround when that happens.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I don't see where you tried that.	St
