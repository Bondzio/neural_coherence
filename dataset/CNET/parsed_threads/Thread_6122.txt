<s> I was hoping someone could give me some insight on this situation. </s>
<s> I am somewhat ignorant on these matters! </s>
<s> I had an external hard drive which I accidentally left running when I left town for three weeks. </s>
<s> When I got back it was making a clicking sound and was slow to access information. </s>
<s> I immediately bought a second hard drive and began backing up my data. </s>
<s> Early in the process my computer crashed, and upon rebooting my drive was no longer accessible. </s>
<s> All the data that was previously transferred up until this point operated just fine. </s>
<s> I paid to have the data recovered and they were able to bring back everything I had lost. </s>
<s> According to the techs, they did a &quot;raw data recovery&quot; which would bring back everything exactly as it was up until my drive failure. </s>
<s> Although everything was recovered and transferred to a second drive, none of the files operate. </s>
<s> OMFI files are unrecognized by AVID, quicktimes suggest corruption, and audio files simply do nothing when launched. </s>
<s> My questions are: Is it typical for a failing drive to corrupt every file it contains immediately before it dies? </s>
<s> Is there any thing I might be able to do at this point, or should I give up on ever recovering this data? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Ive had my external drives crash on me a few times in the past, and Ive been able to get all me data back successfully (luckily) i use Runtime Get Data Back ( http://www.runtime.org ). </s>
<s> it comes in two version, for FAT and NTFS partitions. </s>
<s> the free trial version allows you to search your hard drive for lost files, and open the files/folders it finds, however it does not allow you to recover them, for that you need the full version. </s>
<s> i have never had all my files corrupted when my drives fail and i have never heard of it either. </s>
<s> hope this helps </s>
<s> I checked out that link and RunTime Software actually doesn't recommend their product for use with drives that have physical problems. </s>
<s> They site drives that make strange noises and stop spinning as an example, so I suppose this applies to me. </s>
<s> I've already spent $200 dollars to have the data recovered, it just seems to be corrupt now. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if I have any options at this point. </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip though </s>
<s> Even though the Runtime Software site advises against using their product for physically damaged drives, I thought what the heck? </s>
<s> I've got nothing to lose! </s>
<s> It worked like a charm! </s>
<s> I was able to restore all of my files and they operate just fine! </s>
<s> I wish I had know about this from the beginning instead of using that rip-off data recovery place. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
