Its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work. The screen is a Mitusbishi Diamond Pro 900u. Is there a way to fix this? I know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical. There must be something I can buy that can fix this. Does anyone know of such a product? Thanks in advance, Dave

Still, I don't know what Im looking for, and those sales people who work at those places can never answer anything but very simple questions like &quot;What brands of tires do you carry?&quot;, at least thats what its like here. What would I be looking for? Keep in mind, this isn't glass Im repairing, this is a laminate like protective coating on the glass. Ive seen those glass repair kits, and those don't hide damage, they just seal it and keep cracks from spreading, which isn't my problem. Also, how unsure are you about this advice? (&quot;ymmv&quot;)

There's no magic here. It's optics... Let me dive off into optics for a second and use Google if a phrase sounds foriegn. The refraction index of the repair material will not match the underlying material. As there isn't a match, the repair will not be perfect. But it could be better than no repair. I offer this suggestion with the best intent and if you expect a perfect repair, you'll have to keep looking. Best of luck, Bob

I've got a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 with the same problem - an annoying little dent on the screen surface. What's needed is something which dries in the dent to the same refractive index as the surrounding surface material. Did you find anything which helped? Thanks Michael k-s michael.kirk-smith@ntlworld.com

I have seen it advertised on TV here in the US and think I have seen it for sale in a national drug store chain. Dont know if it will work as I have never tried it. Just thought I would throw it at you as another option for you to look at.

I got my shippment for $11.90......... They only ship in the USA at the moment. Use the left over for sunglasses, goggles, face masks, your watch case....anything with a scratched surface.
