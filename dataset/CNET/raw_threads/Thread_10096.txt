All that shows up is my CDRW/DVD drive, C:, and Memory Stick drive. What can I do to access my information? It is vital for work, and every second I'm without the information on it is costly.

I have the right case for it and software, and the cables are not broken so I don't know whats wrong. Si.

Go to My Computer in Windows Explorer and right click. Click on &quot;Manage&quot;. Under &quot;Storage&quot; click on &quot;Disk Management&quot;. Now look for the drive and make sure it's &quot;activated&quot;. If not activate it. Hope this works for you. and life goes on... Jack
