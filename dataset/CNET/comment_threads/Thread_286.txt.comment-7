Why cant there be just a quick easy fix??
Guess this makes for a good learning experience.
I'm going to try to give HP a call today and see if they can help me out.
If not I will try to use the Drivermax sugesstion, that actually sounds like it may work!
I appreciate all your guys help and ideas.
If you have any more I'm all ears.
