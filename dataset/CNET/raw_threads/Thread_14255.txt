I've had ups and downs with this thing but has worked ok...Since a move I made, the CD Rom will not read any disc I put in. Any ideas on what a non tech person can do without spending alot of money? Also, can anyone tell me what a Kernel32 is? Have been getting an error message with that! Thanks!

With a new CDRW spotted at Office Max for $9.99 or even $19.99 at Best Buy, I have to ask if this is a lot of money for a CDRW drive? You can try a CD Lens Cleaner ($14.95 at your regular music store) and there are some issues if it the drive letter has vanished, but you didn't write that. After a few years, if the drive letter is still there, you try a CD Lens Cleaner, but that costs more than that CDRW drive! Bob
