<s> Some time ago i bought a Lexmark E460dw wireless Laser printer but immediately had trouble trying to set it up to connect with my Dlink DIR600 router. </s>
<s> Message read printer configured but not connected to the network. </s>
<s> I put it on the back burner for later and tried again recently. </s>
<s> Lexmark techies remoted in from Manila (I'm in Australia) and four hours later they gave up! </s>
<s> It couldn't be done! </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with this combination and managed to successfully hook up to a wifi network? </s>
<s> Is there a special way of configuring the router for a printer-all my orher equipment can automatically connect. </s>
<s> I'm using XP </s>
<s> and let them show it works with them. </s>
<s> It just might be defective. </s>
<s> I suppose you started simple, with an unprotected network, and that even that doesn't work. </s>
<s> If you didn't, try that first. </s>

<s> This sounds as if it could be a driver issue, that would be something to check in to. </s>
<s> Since you are running Windows XP, there may be an issue with compatibility. </s>
<s> Assuming the printer software had been installed and this type of issue came up, that's where I'd start. </s>
<s> I'd be curious to know if this unit would fly with a more current OS, Vista or 7, if it would/will not, I'd say likely a defect but with an older OS, I'm more apt to say software compatibility. </s>
<s> Thanks for your quick response. </s>
<s> I'll try setting up again. </s>
