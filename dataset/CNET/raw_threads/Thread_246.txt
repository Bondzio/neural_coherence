First off for some reason, one day the mouse or keyboard stop working...so i tried a different mouse and keyboard with no luck....there are 2 USB ports in the front and one in the back... It was plugged into the USB ports....I also tried the other old port also, i think its called the serial/com port? but still no luck.... Then I tried resetting the bios by taking out the battery on the motherboard....but once i turn the computer back on....the main bios screen came on, but since I cant use the keyboard to escape out of the bois...i cant get into windows....now i am stuck in the bois screen...i also tried buying a PCI 2.0 USB card....but i cant install it since i cant get in windows to install the driver.... ANY HELP PLEASE!?????

It's out of stock, but 423 socket boards can be cheap. http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=D850GBACNR-R Then you get a new case and start moving it. The OS hopefully will run on worst case will have to be obtained and installed. Do some checks to see what Sony wants for repair and then how much for motherboard, case/powersupply and maybe an operating system. Best of luck, bob

Then you can answer that question. You post is all I know of your machine's failure. Since you've tried the other ports with known good keyboards... 400 is far too much for this repair. You can find boards galore for 99 bucks. I wouldn't do this. 400 gets a new box... with XP... http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CMHP552W-R&cat=SYS there are many more out there like this and frankly that repair price is a _____ (pick a word).
