i think you misunderstand me.
i want to keep my normal power supply the 200w one in ym hp.
but take the new power supply stand it ouside of my computer run the power cord for the video card into the computer plug it into the video card and power my computer using 2 power supplies so i don't have to cut my case or anything.
i've already done measurements and the new power supply is 2 times to big for my computer case and some of the cords don't have the right pin numbers.
but the video card has the right amount of pins.
