i too have been with norton for a few years now.
this month when my subscription ran out if was notified by e-mail and given the opportunity to re-subscribe for $39 or upgrage to the new norton internet security package for $59.
i upgraded and paid $5 more for the disk to be sent to me versus the download; from my past horrible results with the norton download.
guess what - 2 things: first when i got the disk and ran thru the install, i had major problems and liveupdate would not run - spent 2 full days online with their techies to get it working and now only sporadically.
second, and you'll love this: i was charged for both the re-subscription and the upgrade for a total of $103 and there's nobody i can talk to.
my next computer will have a different security program, you can bet on it - probably zonealarm that falcon recommends.
falcon strongly does not recommend norton and will only provide it with customer requests.
