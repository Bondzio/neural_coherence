<s> I would like to buy an All in One Printer (print, copy, scan and fax). </s>
<s> I thought I had settled on the HP 7310, but now I am hearing negative things about the HP software. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You will find negative comments about all of these printers. </s>
<s> Not a single one is perfect and add to that the number of machines with issues (spyware, drivers, etc.) </s>
<s> and you have a recipe for bad feedback on any printer. </s>

<s> It's sort of amazing people will keep trying on what they consider to be a dud. </s>

<s> And they all work for me. </s>
<s> Basically if it's on the shelf at office max, depot, staples it works for me. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why. </s>
