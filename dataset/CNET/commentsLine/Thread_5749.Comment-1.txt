hi all ive always used mac desktops because i prefer osx and windows laptops because i could never justify the price of mac portables but the time has come for a desktop upgrade because my imac is struggling with my lightroom library and photoshop use, also the tiny hard drive is pretty much full to the brim and has died on me once already.
im still trying to decide between the top of the range 27 inch imac or a custom build pc, now if you just go by specs the pc would walk all over the mac in every department but in the real world what would be faster?
specs of the pc - comes in under &#163;1000 intel i7 2600k 3.4ghz (or ivybridge) asrock z68 extreme3 gen3 mobo corsair vengeance 8gb 1600mhz ram mushkin chronos 120gb ssd for boot and lightroom 1tb wd caviar black nvidia gtx 570 24 inch display and the mac - &#163;1649 intel i5 3.1ghz 4gb 1333mhz ram 1tb hdd amd radeon 6970m either machine will be primarily used for photoshop, lightroom, itunes, dxo optics pro, photomatix pro and the rest of the cs5 master collection which would you choose, try to forget the os, i think osx is far superior but i'm sure i could get used to windows 7 being on my primary machine anyway.
thanks
