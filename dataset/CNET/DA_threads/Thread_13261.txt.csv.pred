1.1.1	Hello Everyone, The following link explains how to calculate the maximum throughput on 802.11b: http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/voice/c_ipphon/english/wip7920/7920ddg/wrlapdxi.pdf Summarizing the article, it proposes the following equation: Theoretical Maximum Throughput = (Packet Length * 8 * 1000000) / (Preamble + Header + ((Packet Length + 28) * 8 / Rate) + SIFS + Preamble + Header + (ACK * 8 / Rate) + DIFS + ((Backoff / 2) * Slot)) I understand almost all of the equations components, but I'm not sure about it ((Backoff / 2 ) * Slot)), I know that this time it is necessary because of the backoff algorithm of CSMA/CA, but I don't know why is it necessary the division by 2.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know why the division by 2 is necessary??	St
1.1.3	How can I know if the correct number is 2 or 3 or ...??	St
1.1.4	Hernn.	St
1.2.1	All drivers don't implement it.	St
1.2.2	Read http://madwifi.org/ticket/852 Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you Bob, but it doesn't answer my question.	St
1.3.2	H.	St
1.4.1	Since it's not (or may not be) implemented you may discard it's effect.	St
1.4.2	You may have a bigger goal in mind but between this post and your other post I can't see what you are attempting to figure out that a simple link test couldn't answer.	St
1.4.3	Maybe you are trying to figure out what the maximum transfer rate is but given &quot;reality&quot; items such as the client or host ACK time is variable then I can write that I've yet to find the mathematical models to match the real world.	St
1.4.4	Most of the error is the delay in the acks.	St

1.5.1	FYI - A Test I ran last year Transfer 28.0 megabyte file from my server to my wireless laptop located 14 feet away and indicating excellent signal strength.	St
1.5.2	Wireless B = 70 sec Wireless G = 47 sec (router set in mixed Mode) Wireless G = 36 sec (router set in G Mode only) Wireless N = 12 sec (Belkin Pre N hardware) Wired NIC = 4 sec (Wired 10/100 ethernet)	St
