i have a similar problem to the original query.
i don't know the solution, but can shed some light on the subject.
equipment: belkin high speed mode wireless router and desktop network card running windows xp sp1.
i only have one pc at the moment but am planning to add more soon.
i want to move the computer to another room to decorate but use the wifi link to continue access to the internet.
router and dsl broadband modem work fine when connected using the wired lan with the wifi link disabled.
when enabled the wifi link has good signal - not surprising as they sit next to each other.
i cannot however get the internet.
if i enable the wifi link while connected to the internet and disable/disconnect the wired lan, the internet continues to work fine over the wifi link.
shutting down and re booting however looses the internet link.
i think windows xp is the problem but i don't know how to configure it.
the wizard seems to be a waste of time.
any suggestions?
