My bad.
I suck at typing and am very slow at it.
I always look at the keyboard and not the screen, so I never spellcheck.
So here is the post: For now yes the 57 dominates the games more than the 4800, but the 4800 can help you alot more with running multiple applications.
The gaming industry is going to take advantage of dual core processors.
Also as said in a previous post, new lines of processors are coming out, which most likely means price break for you.
So I suggest you wait.
Although the 57 will get you more fps, the 4800 still has far more useful value and does great on games.
