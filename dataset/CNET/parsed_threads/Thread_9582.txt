<s> I have a 566MHz processor. </s>
<s> Ive tried to burn a dvd but holly it takes a like 18hours. </s>
<s> and thats just a 1 GIG of video. </s>
<s> Im guessing not even if i upgrade it wont make a difference. </s>
<s> So my question is which comp or kind of computer can help to burn this kind of video. </s>
<s> The actual recording time should be about the same with your CPU and some 2+ GHz CPU. </s>
<s> What will change is the ENCODING time. </s>
<s> It's very linear to CPU power. </s>
<s> If you had a twice as fast CPU, it would take 1/2 as long. </s>
<s> Any under 1,000 buck desktop will do this much faster but none (at that price) will break it down in less than say, one hour. </s>

<s> Yes!!! </s>
<s> For example when I first got into video edditing and I would render a 10min video on my 500mhz PC, it would take 40min to complete!!!! </s>
<s> Now the same video will render on my 3200+ AMD64 in about 6 min. </s>
