use any of the common consumer broadband routers with wireless - your choice of brand.
i won't start a row here over which brand and model is best, you can research that easily enough.
when you get one, just substitute it for your existing wired router.
be aware that nearly all the wireless routers in fact have the usual complement of four wired ethernet ports on the back too, so it will be a one-for-one swap of devices with your current router.
first you'll need to configure it for your particular isp service, and then secure it.
securing your router is important, but often ignored.
