i think i get the idea.
if i install the programs on the win 2000 computer i can copy the data for those programs from the second hd.
next question!
if i leave the hd from the win me computer in win 2000 computer will win 2000 be able to run those programs?
the me hd would be a slave.
how much of win me could i delete from the hd?
