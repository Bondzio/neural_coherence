<s> I'm not sure the problem is hardware but that's how I have two computer hard drives and installed operating system is divided into two partitions, one partition was gone! </s>
<s> She appears on devices but no letter and you can not add a letter and tried with a third-party software (EASEUS Partition Master) also recognizes the drive but you can not do with anything with the software I can see the files but not access them. </s>
<s> Please it is really important can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Two questions only: 1. </s>
<s> How can you seen the files if you can't see the drive they are on? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What does Disk Management (that's a program in Windows) say about that partition? </s>
<s> My guess: Disk Management says it's unallocated (then make a partition on the available space) or it needs to be formatted (then do that). </s>
<s> In both cases you'll only lose what you didn't backup. </s>
<s> That should only be a few files. </s>
<s> If it's more, consider using a data recovery program to see what it can recover and copy to your other partition or an external disk. </s>
