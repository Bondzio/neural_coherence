1.1.1	I upgraded my computer about an hour ago , by installing a Zotac gtx 650 Ti ( drivers were installed correctly ) and a a Rosewill RD600 Stallion Series psu .	St
1.1.2	computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes .	St
1.1.3	However , when I entered a second game to test settings , my computer completely crashed .	St
1.1.4	No bluescreen or anything , it just instantly shut off .	St
1.1.5	Now when I simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots , but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast .	St
1.1.6	No follow-on beeps , just the cpu fan running full speed .	St
1.1.7	I have never heard it this loud before .	St
1.1.8	I do not get any video output to my monitor , and the led on the power button of my case does n't even light up , as if the computer is n't even turned on .	St
1.1.9	I upgraded this factory model from gateway DX4840-03e The specs for this system are -1 TB HDD -Intel i3 540 cpu running at ~3.1 Ghz -8 GB RAM Thanks in advance for the help .	St
1.2.1	When this happens I unplug the new video card , PSU and go back .	St
1.2.2	That way I can see if the original gear is still OK. Also , you can get out your Volt meter and check the CMOS Battery .	St
1.2.3	You want to read 3 or a little more Volts .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ok , when i go back , what can I do if it does n't run well .	St
1.3.2	Is there any way to salvage it from there ?	Ques
1.4.1	Go back to the old power supply and video card..	St
1.4.2	If that works , replace the P/S first and I suspect it wo n't work .	St
1.4.3	The fan on the CPU comes on fast at first but should be reduced quickly when the BIOS loads , otherwise it will run at full speed .	St
1.4.4	This tells me the 5 volts has failed but the 12 volts is okay .	St
1.5.1	But I hope you wo n't be upset as it 's the same as fixing any PC .	St
1.5.2	Find or guess the failed part , replace that .	St
1.5.3	Which is it ?	Ques
1.5.4	If you knew each time , you 've make a small fortune .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	The problem was the power supply as mjd420nova suggested .	St
1.6.2	I 'm not sure why .	St
1.6.3	I did find this http : //www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html psu that is meant specifically for my model computer .	St
1.6.4	Would you recommend buying this ?	Ques
1.6.5	The only reason I 'm asking is because I 'm skeptical about any other psu working with my mobo .	St
1.6.6	Was the one I just bought an isolated case ?	Ques
1.7.1	It did n't look like a bad choice with it being SINGLE RAIL to avoid you learning about all that .	St
1.7.2	Next time , add 100 more Watts .	St
1.7.3	More power , arr arr arr !	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	That was right .	Res
1.8.2	So was that an isolated incident with only that psu or will my computer reject every new one I try to install , for instance this http : //www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-gate-gateway-dx4840.html	St
1.9.1	Sorry , but can you explain to me what single rail means ?	Ques
1.10.1	A single +12V RAIL means you do n't need to check into if one or more rails could be overtaxed by your GPU or other choices .	St
1.10.2	You also do n't have to take care for run the one rail to your GPU then the others to drives and such .	St
1.10.3	That 's called balancing the rails , well discussed and most folk burst into flames when they find out about this .	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
1.11.1	How can you tell if a psu is single or multi rail ?	Ques
1.11.2	Unless it says it somewhere in the product description and i missed it .	St
1.12.1	Look at the output ratings and if it 's a single +12V rail you see one Ampere rating for the lone +12V .	St
1.12.2	If more you see them tell you the rating for each rail .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
