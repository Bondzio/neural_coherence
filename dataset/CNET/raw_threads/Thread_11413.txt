The CPU is very nice but I'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree. I'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt PSU at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 RAM. Any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance.

Keep in mind that E8500 (3.16 GHz) can outperform many quad-cores in single and dual-threaded applications because of the higher processor frequency. Good purchase!
