<s> I formatted my 2gb flash drive to FAT32 and now its only 60mb, I don't know why I did it but can anyone help my get it back to 2gb. </s>
<s> that drive never was 2 gigs it was always 60 megs.. </s>
<s> I would chalk it up and get another or return it if you can </s>
<s> Web link to the product too. </s>
<s> There are some fakes out there, so be aware I might write you were ripped off. </s>
<s> Its a gfm and I bought it from target 2 years ago and it actually was 2gb(more like 1.9) but now its only showing up as 60. </s>
<s> I have had more than 1.5gb in music on it before and I know for a fact it was the size its advertised to be. </s>
<s> I just want to get it back to its original size. </s>
<s> Try http://www.gfmproducts.com/category.asp?iSubID=9 But given so little to work with I'm going to call it dead. </s>
<s> Are you a Linux user? </s>
<s> If so there are tools to resize and format some players but I'd like to dive into the make and model and see if there is a tool for your device first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No I'm not a linux user I just recently downgraded to xp </s>
<s> Is to help us help you. </s>
<s> I asked for you to identify your player, preferably with a link so I might find a tool for your player. </s>
<s> Is that reasonable? </s>
<s> I actually bought this at Meijer and can't find the product on the website. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> This is all I got about it. </s>
<s> http://www.gfmproducts.com/support.asp And I also can't find it on http://www.meijer.com/ </s>
<s> So nobody can help me? </s>
<s> What do other people have their flash drives formatted to? </s>
<s> Is there formatting software that can help me reformat my flash drive? </s>
<s> Without identifying the product, finding it's support links it's likely to be junk. </s>
<s> I will note I use linux to fix a few but you seem to have dismissed that. </s>
<s> If you get desperate research that on google.com </s>
<s> Alright thank you </s>
