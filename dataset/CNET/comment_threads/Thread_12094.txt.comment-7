1. is it worth while upgrading to sp2 2. if it does actually connect, will i be able to get the data from the HD?
3. just want to confirm the usb thing so is there some way i can check in the computer itself?
I will also try and the Drive or Disk Management but the only problem is that its all in Japanese and is going to take me some time!
Gulp.
What exactly should I be looking for with the drivers?
Thanks
