my deskjet 3650 won't print.
it keeps blinking.
it says remove right cartridge and if it still blinks cartridge in side might be broken.
i called hp they said out of warentee.
i don't remember any cartridge inside the machine besides the 2 ink ones (color and black).
what cartridge could they mean.
thanks, confusimo
