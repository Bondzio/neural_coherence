<s> have a 5.8 ghz uniden cordless phone on 1st story of home. </s>
<s> also have a 2.4 ghz uniden on second floor of home and works ok. i have a wireless router for laptop on 1st floor. </s>
<s> changed channels on 5.8 ghz and changed the battery on the handset but still get static. </s>
<s> is it the 5.8 ghz or just a bum phone? </s>
<s> don't understand why the 5.8 versus 2.4. could someone explain in plain talk for me ? </s>
<s> thanks jack </s>
<s> The 5.8GHz should be unaffected by the 2.4GHz devices. </s>
<s> It may get flightly at some distance from the base, but in the same room should be fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> These phones should be fine. </s>
<s> I had a problem with 2.4 GHz phones causing my wireless connection to drop given they work at near identical frequency of the router. </s>
<s> Wireless network uses Netgear Rangemax and Netgear USB. </s>
<s> Even though computer signal was strong the 2.4 GHzphones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 GHz was anwered. </s>
<s> It didn't matter if the phone was not even near the router or USB. </s>
<s> I have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 GHz including one near (&lt;8 ft.) to the router and another within a foot of the USB. </s>
<s> No problems at all now with phone interference either for the router or the phones. </s>
<s> I believe (I may be wrong) 5.8 GHz phones may have more range than other phones so your interference may relate to other phones in your area. </s>
<s> Jim </s>
<s> ...that the 2.4GHz frequency band of wireless networking gear has ever caused problems for a cordless phone, only the other way around. </s>
<s> We frequently get the question of ''Why does my wireless connection to the internet disappear whenever I answer my (2.4GHz) cordless phone,'' but I've never seen asked ''Why does my cordless phone go dead/have burst of static whenever I send an email from my wireless laptop.'' </s>
<s> It seems whenever there is a conflict, the microwave ovens and cordless phones always win. </s>
<s> Adding to that, your problematic phone is a 5.8GHz model. </s>
<s> That's a completely different frequency band. </s>
<s> If there is a radio signal conflict, it should be with a device on the same band, not the 2.4GHz band - unless there is a defect in the radio emitter of one or another specific device that is spilling a whole spectrum of garbage frequencies into the air, but that's a different kettle of fish. </s>
<s> Shifting now to troubleshooting mode - what happens when you turn off your wifi equipment (all of it - router and computer(s))? </s>
<s> Do you still get the static on the phone? </s>
<s> What happens if you put the 5.8GHz unit downstairs and the 2.4GHz unit upstairs? </s>
<s> Do you still get the static? </s>
<s> Can you take the problematic set to a friend's house, plug it in there, and make a call? </s>
<s> Is there still static? </s>
<s> Just some ideas to narrow down whether the unit is bum, or the location you are using it in is bum. </s>
<s> I don't think there is interference from your wifi, it is something else. </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> I had just sent the following message to CNet, when I did a cordless phone search through CNet and found your answer. </s>
<s> You sound like you might know a thing or two about cordless phones. </s>
<s> The only additional information I can give you in addition to the following not is that I am currently using a 5.8 GHz cordless. </s>
<s> I STILL GET STATIC. </s>
<s> It is so annoying!! </s>
<s> ''Although it's not really a computer or network question, I'd like to know what your subscribers think the best cordless phone is. </s>
<s> I've had bad luck and the expensive sets don't seem to be any better than the cheap ones. </s>
<s> They all wind up having static breaking in on my conversations. </s>
<s> It's very annoying. </s>
<s> I keep them charged up, should I be letting them run down? </s>
<s> The only really good cordless phone set I have ever used belonged to a friend. </s>
<s> It was a Seimens. </s>
<s> By the time I could afford to get it...I saved for quite a while...they were no longer available anywhere. </s>
<s> Phones with cords don't even seem to be much better. </s>
<s> ''So, would you consider helping me out here? </s>
<s> ''Could you ask the readers what they think for me, please? </s>
<s> ''Or if you have some good info...I need some. </s>
<s> ''Thanks a million! </s>
<s> ''Kitty Ichelson'' If this gets to you and you can give me some insight...brands, prices, GHz's, nothing seems to make a difference. </s>
<s> Except I never heard static on my friend's phone, the Seimens and they can't be found anymore. </s>
<s> Do ham set interfer? </s>
<s> CB radios? </s>
<s> PASSING AIRPLANES???? </s>
<s> I can't figure it out. </s>
