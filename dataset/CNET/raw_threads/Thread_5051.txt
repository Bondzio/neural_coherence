Anyway from the front to where they keyboard starts (including the touch pad) has kind of bent upward. I can see all the orange wires and they look all connected (mite not be) but when the laptop is on they keyboard will no longer work, (having to use a USB keyboard Any ideas what it could be? Loose connection? hardware fault or software fault, but all other hardware and osx are fine. Thanks MF

While it likely can be fixed since there are all of two parts involved (keyboard and mainboard) the weird thing is that since it's not yours why would you fix it? Just wondering. Bob

I don't like fixing my friend's computers that have suffered such damage since the unit could decide to turn into a brick just by removing the case. It's suffered some hard times but still works. Until you are sure they are OK with getting a brick back I'd leave it alone. Plus if you do, why open it unless you have the spare parts to put in? Bob

He is holding the front together with tape at the moment, any ideas how to bend the front panel back into place? When I had a look there were lots of small round marks round the edge but could not see any screws missing. Thanks MF

I'm not so good at that. -&gt; For me I would be hitting Ebay to see if I could scrounge up a not so bent up case. Bob
