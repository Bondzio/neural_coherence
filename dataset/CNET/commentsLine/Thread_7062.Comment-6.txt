and sorry but i can only guess the usual.
there is another item that repeats a lot on home built units.
the builder has left an extra mounting stud under the motherboard.
it's been a good money maker for the shop as the home builder can't believe that so they bring it in.
if it didn't fry the board, cheap for us to correct.
