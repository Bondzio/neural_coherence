So I'm pretty sure this is a PSU problem.
When I turn my computer on after it being powered down for a while, it will not detect either of my 2 hard drives.
I assume they are not getting any power.
I turn off my psu via the power switch on the back of the unit, then turn it back on...wait for it to charge back up and start my computer up again.
Everything runs smoothly after that.
I have to do this procedure every time I want to turn my computer on.
I am fortunate not to have had either of my hard drives fail/fry due to this.
My question is does anyone know what is happening?
Is the psu going completely down the tubes?
And has does it keep from frying my drives?
Is there a protection system that turns off all power to the hard drives if there is not enough power to give to them?
