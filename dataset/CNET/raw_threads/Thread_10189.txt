I switched because i thought i wouldnt have to worry bout the mac running slow due to excess software such as virus protection. My macbook takes a very long time to load ALL internet pages. I know my connection is fine because my old computer, which is about 6 years old, runs super quick on the internet. Is there something i dont know. Are there any certain settings i should be looking at? i feel like i should save some money and just get dial-up!!!!! I do have a cable internet connection. its wired in, not wireless, if that makes a difference. thanks in advance

If you macbook is brand new and you haven't been using it for more than I think thirty days you can call the apple helpline, I can't remember what they did, but it certainly helped. If you can't find the number for the apple helpline, I can give it too you if you need it.
