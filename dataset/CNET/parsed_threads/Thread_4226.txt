<s> We have a LaCie Porche external hard drive that we use for backup. </s>
<s> We lent it to our daughter Wednesday. </s>
<s> Today we tried to reinstall it but are having problems. </s>
<s> Actually, it did come up once but it froze our system. </s>
<s> Since then we have been unable to bring the hard drive up. </s>
<s> We are using Windows XP. </s>
<s> How can we reinstall this drive without having problems? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The system information is OS Name </s>
<s> This is a USB drive I assume? </s>
<s> Have you tried the cable in a different USB port, sometimes plugging into the front panel port will work when the back panel port won't. </s>
<s> Is your daughter running Windows or possibly a Mac? </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I gave up on the La Cie for a while but tried again this week. </s>
<s> I am still having the same problems. </s>
<s> My daughter's computer uses WIndows XP. </s>
<s> I have contacted LaCie and tired all their suggestions including downloading an update. </s>
<s> However, my computer still freezes if the LaCIE is on at restart. </s>
<s> Then if I turn it on , the computer recognizes the drive but I have been unable to write to it. </s>
<s> My husband does not think it is the cable because it worked on our daughter's computer. </s>
<s> I'll try plugging into another port but I'm not sure we have a front panel port. </s>
<s> It worked so well last year on both my computer and one other that I thought it was terrific. </s>
<s> I am disppointed and frustrated with the current problems. </s>
<s> SHould I just give up and order another hard drive? </s>
<s> &quot;my computer still freezes if the LaCIE is on at restart&quot; If this was my machine, I'd search for the maker of the motherboard's web site and install their latest MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE. </s>
<s> Windows XP does not know or supply drivers for AMD based motherboards. </s>
<s> They have a basic package, but not something I would use too long. </s>
<s> At http://www.asus.com.tw/support/download/item.aspx?ModelName=A7V600-X I see USB 2.0 drivers and the motherboard driver packages. </s>
<s> Microsoft will not fetch or install such for you. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
