Even though I delete it, it comes back again. I tried to install AVG 7.5 but it seems to not help at all. Any comments will do, thanks!

My usb got infected as well but when we scanned it (dont remember what anti-virus), it detected a Worm on it. I tried to scanned my pc with AVG 7.5 but it only detects spyware. The new folder thing is still there.
