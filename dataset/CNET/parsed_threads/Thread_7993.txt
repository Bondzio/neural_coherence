<s> probably as gateway owns emachines. </s>
<s> its not the same mobo. </s>
<s> the 827gm has intel integrated graphics or dat is what it says at circuitcity http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Gateway-Desktop-PC-827GM-/sem/rpsm/oid/120108/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do although dat is surprising as i thought intel only made mb for their processors. </s>
<s> emachines t6212 uses a msi ati x200 chipset. </s>
<s> There is a mistake in the Circuit City Web Site, its not the Intel 900, its the Radon 200 in the 827GM </s>
