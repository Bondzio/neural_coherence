Why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts?
It has to do with the wiring used.
For years I've encountered issues with front ports.
To avoid this I use the rear ports when there is trouble.
Sorry but it's late so I'll stop here and not answer why the industry is in a fine mess.
