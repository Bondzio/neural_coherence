something you might like to think about.
i have two hp printers one dj350 and a 3in 1. both developed significant faults.
the 3in1 would not print in word but would print a web page.
the dj450 would not print in colour.
we tried everything but could not improve the situation.
some months later we had to re-install windows xp and lo and behold both printers worked perfectly.
i have no idea what the fault was but re-installing the printer software didn't improve the situation.
i have damaged my canon pixma mp170 installation cd and could do with a copy software or cd.
can anyone help please?
mike
