And after it's up and running I will be posting updates to this thread, so take a shot heres your opportunity. I'm looking to build a &quot;Supercomputer&quot;. I am in the position that money is not a concern, but instead of just giving an unlimited budget, I'd like to set a limit at about $8,000 (this includes everything down to the mouse (including keyboard, monitor, everything)). Now, even though I have done this before, I'm running into many problems on specs. It has been about 3 years since the last time I have built a computer from scratch, and of course the technology has changed drastically and is still changing. But I have done this several times in the past. Here's what I'll be using the computer for:

Get OCX Platinum for overclocking. The videos will do nicely. SCSIs are on the way out. Go with dual WD Raptor 10k SATA on a RAID0 array, striped and a 300gb SATA for files. If you are looking for BEST quality in a monitor, get a ViewSonic 21&quot; flat screen or a Samsung. Yes, they are big, but you wanted the best, right? I'll leave the case up to you. and life goes on... Jack p.s. For $8K I'd even consider a XEON server...just a thought.;)

This means newer motherboards and AMD processors using the socket M2. Socket M2 I believe is the sucessor to the socket 939 and more powerful processors are going to be using the M2. Although the only components that will be affected by the new socket in my list of hardware for you to get, is the motherboard and the AMD processor both using the socket 939. If you totally want to future proof your PC, I say you wait and get the new motherboard/ processor using the socket M2. As I said, you can still get the other parts such as hard drive, sound card, etc. but may want to hold off getting the motherboard/ processor. Also AMD will be making an AMD X2 4800+ and all of its dual core processors using the M2 socket. If you don't want to wait, that it up to you. As I said you can still get the other hardware for your system.

It depends on what components you want, for example you may want a cheaper sound card, etc. This gaming machine will be sick and can handle anything today and down the road for a long long time. I wish I had the chance to build one but so far I am saving up for components. I really hope this build works for you.

I here that a Raid 0 con-fig actually speeds up the seek times, am I correct in this? Can someone explain (or point me in the right direction) in plain English just what this will do for me. Your suggestion of 2x74 plus a 500gb would be the best way to go, should I set up the 74's in ''raid0'' and if so how do I do this? Remember as simply as possible. Thanks for you patience.

Ok about the hard drive question, you set the 2x 74 Raptor (which is the company that makes 10,000 rpm hard drives) 10,000 rpm hard drives in a Raid 0 so it is like making a big 148gb hard drive. People tend to use these hard drives for the OS. Since it is 10,000 rpm, the hard drives spin faster than normal (which is about 7,200 rpm) giving you faster access to your files, etc. The 500gb hard drive would be a seperate hard drive for your games, movies, and other programs that take large space. It is totally up to you on how you want to use your hard drive(s). Monitor looks good; Samsung makes high quality monitors, but I couldn't tell if the monitor is 4ms or 8ms. The &quot;ms&quot; is the response time for an LCD. 8ms is the standard for gaming with an LCD or watching movies. Their are LCDs out with 4ms response times, which is significantly better. Any questions, reply back.

Anyway I think I am finally getting it, as far as the Raid config is concerned. thanks again. As far as the Monitor, as far as I can tell (and I have read many reviews and tests) it has a 6ms seek time. What really caught my eye was the pivoting display and the fact that it will go portrait automatically. Great for what I use it for. Now on to ordering the system.

You can get one for less than $10. At least have another computer handy to download drivers and transfer them to/from the proper discs.

One question, do you work for Alienware? as your name might indicate? Anyway I will keep you updated on the build and thank you for all your help....absolutely invaluable One other question if you don't mind. I have yet to order the powersupply. I can save a bundle by ordering the &quot;SilverStone Zeus Series 650-W NVIDIA-Certified SLI PSU&quot; instead of the &quot;PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 850 SLI&quot; will that unit give me what I need nowq and in the future and what do you think of the Manufaturer.

I only suggested the 850-watt power supply because you will have alot of high ends parts in your system and it is always good to have enough power for them all. This is a bargain 850-watt psu and comes with 3yr. warranty, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104126 or you can get this 700-watt power supply http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104015 Yes I used to work Alienware, but I didn't leave on mutual terms. Hope the build works.

With all the high end gear and hardware you will need a bigger psu (at least in my view, you might get away though), so as I said you should get a 700-watt psu or greater. I was looking at other parts when I cam across this neat cooling kit http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/07/koolance_exos_2.html It might be too much or overkill, but if you want to keep your parts cool(and I am aware that you case comes with a cooling kit), you can get it .

I was reading reviews the other day and ran across several that list peoples computer builds. We must be doing something right as this identical built was listed twice (can't remember where I saw it, had to many up). They were however posted 2 days after I posted the original discussion, so maybe they just copied it, who knows. As far as Alienware goes, I don't blame you. When they first started they were great, but have lost something recently. I was originally going to purchase the ALX and was turned off by their &quot;customer service&quot;. Thanks again

Although apple only has a selection of one graphics card, just go out and buy it yourself. Although apple is expensive, i think that if money is no object then go ahead.
