<s> There is a computer at my job with building automation software on it, uses an sql database. </s>
<s> The software recommends a 512 graphics card. </s>
<s> The computer has a monitor but we don't use it that way. </s>
<s> We all connect to it via Remote Desktop. </s>
<s> Does the that computer benefit having a graphics card? </s>
<s> Or do only the computers remoting in need a graphics card? </s>
<s> The PC that has the monitor connected should have the graphic card. </s>

<s> How does that computers graphics card help the remote user? </s>
<s> If the server is just storing the exe-file, and it's run on the client PC, the client PC should have the graphics card. </s>
<s> If it's a terminal server, remote desktop or Citrix setup (using a thin client), it most likely is a server thing also. </s>
<s> Then better ask the guy who manages the server. </s>

<s> Is that I've written apps that log events and more to the SQL database and with rare exception you can't use what is known as a HEADLESS SERVER for some systems because they used Windows. </s>
<s> I don't want to duplicate all that has been written about HEADLESS SERVERs but your product's maker must tell you if it can be done. </s>
<s> Keep in mine that I've done such but the costs are higher than if I went with a plain old PC with a card. </s>
