1.1.1	I have a HP Pavilion pc (brought in 2005).	St
1.1.2	Well, the other day when I turned the pc on, the monitor picture shrink until it completing turned black.	St
1.1.3	It remindered me of the old tv when the picture tube was going out the picture would &quot;rolled&quot; until a thin line was in the middle, then black.	St
1.1.4	I can hear the pc (tower) humming, trying to work.	St
1.1.5	I turned off the pc, unplug and waited for about 1 hour.	St
1.1.6	Plugged everything back, turn it on, hear the &quot;tower&quot; working but still black monitor.	St
