you can add an extra harddrive and ram yourself it is easy just know what kind of ram your motherboard can take.
if you buy a larger harddrive make sure you have new ide cables to hook to the motherboard and make sure you designate whether you want the the new drive to be the master or the slave.
i upgraded my old computer by adding a 200gb harddrive and putting in two 256 sticks of ram my system is from quite a few years ago the max my motherboard can hold is 512mb of ram.
i have an old e-machines 1140 with a 1.1 gb processor and came with a 20gb harddrive.
it came with no e-machines systems disk so i called the support number it got it in early 2003 when my system was his by a virus at that time.
i am running norton antivirus professional with the firewall.
my operating system is windows xp home with sp2.
another way to get help is to look at cnet dot coms help guides that show step by step how to do things also.
