<s> Have spent years building up this music collection. </s>
<s> Suddenly one morning my computer was still recognising the drive (but not as the name I had named it), but saw nothing on it. </s>
<s> Contacted Maxtor, recommended OnTrack. </s>
<s> Ran OnTrack - found 16178 (there should be 18000+) and put up message &quot;Error encountered while scanning partition&quot;. </s>
<s> I then don't have 80Gb space on my PC. </s>
<s> Is there a way of partitioning the hard drive so I can put the 80Gb on the same drive? </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> A little more info please. </s>
<s> What OS, is this the only HD on the PC, Is this the system drive???? </s>
<s> Remember ALL HARD DRIVES WILL CRASH SOME DAY!!!!!!! </s>
