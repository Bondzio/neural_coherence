i have a belkin n+ v2.
i have noticed that in xfire and aim, i get logged off and it says reconnecting in ..... i've come to realize that my router is disconnecting me from the internet for a split second, because it happens alot like once every ten minutes, but i have never fully lost connection from the internet.
this is really annoying.
is my unit defective?
have i diagnosed my problem wrong?
i really need help.
this router is only 6 months old.
thanks in advance.
