Hello, I have a small 3 comp.
home network (Win XP pro).
All machines have fixed IP adresses.
I have a switch and through it the comp.
connect to ADSL.
It works fine, but as soon as I add my laptop to the LAN (connect it to the switch), the LAN looses internet connectivity.
As soon as I disconnect the laptop, the internet is back, why?
The switch has 5 ports + uplink to the ADSL modem.
Regards, Mirza
