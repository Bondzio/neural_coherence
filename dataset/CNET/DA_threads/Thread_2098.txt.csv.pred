1.1.3	I have a 1.6 pentium in it and have just scored a celeron d335+ processor .	St
1.1.4	I see the cooling fan and heat sinks dont fit but can i still use the processor with my old coolling system ?	Ques
1.1.5	Do i have to edit and bios **** ?	Ques
1.1.6	Any help would be much apreciated ...	St
1.2.1	You might be able to .	St
1.2.2	Go into your bios and see if there is a cpu temperature reading if you want to use the old heatsink and fan .	St
1.2.3	Remember you need to grease the heatsink with the cpu .	St
1.2.4	Besides , do n't the cpu you have came with a heatsink and fan combo , mine did but it was a pentinum D. If not , look up a heatsink with the correct socket for the motherboard .	St
1.2.5	You can look it up on yahoo or google and find the motherboard and its socket type .	St
1.2.6	Hope that helps .	St
1.3.1	heatsink/fan mounting is standardized for socket 478 and that 's a mid-tower case so height should n't be an issue .	St
1.3.2	i would n't recommend using the original cooler since this cpu runs more than 1ghz higher ( and hotter ) than your original cpu .	St
1.3.3	the latest bios for that system is from june 2002 , 2 full years prior to the release of the celeron 335. the dimension 's bios may not know how to deal with that cpu .	St
1.4.1	Hey thanks for replying , O.k well i.ve tryed the new processor ( celeron d 335+ ) and no go my computer or motherboard or whatever wont reconize it .	St
1.4.2	So i 've looked all over the net and have found out that intel no longer supports my motherboard but the last info on it that they posted was it supported a celeron 1.8 i think it was , so i 'm thinking that if i change my bios to read the new processor it will work ( i 'm new to this stuff so if i 'm totally wrong dont hold it against me . )	St
1.5.1	Exactly what i was thinking .	St
1.5.2	can i change the bios to read the new cpu ?	Ques
1.5.3	If so can you tell me how ?	Ques
1.5.4	And as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing .	St
1.5.5	The new systems clamps are completly different to the old .	St
1.6.1	you may be able to get an updated bios from here : http : //www.biosman.com/replacement.htm but i think you 're beating a dead horse .	St
1.6.2	after the bios update and cpu change , windows may need to be reinstalled or reactivated .	St
1.6.3	you may just have problem after problem to deal with .	St
1.7.1	if you are sure and double check what the bios update will support then it should recognize the celeron d 1.8 you are referring to .	St
1.7.2	It should work because I just changed from celeron d to pentinum d on my intel motherboard but luckily i did not need to update my bios .	St
