I was looking at the &quot;Link MediaLounge DSM-520&quot; does this play all formats of streaming audio? Help!!!

Many are astonishingly bad or have other issues you will only discover after you set it up. The flaws rarely are written up in reviews. 2. Go ahead and find reviews but again, test in real life before you buy.
