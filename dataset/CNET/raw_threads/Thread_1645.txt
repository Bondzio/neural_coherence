I have selected to connect to infrastructure only. Is this because of an AP/Router issue or the laptop? thanks in advance -lige

I have it set up SSID broadcasting but with WEP. The WWW from desktop browser works and that is how I did config of wireless security. The client laptop connects just fine...just gets dropped when another wireless device is detected. I have been reading that the Iphones and Blackberrys cause problems for AP/Routers. Just thought someone would have been there done that with this problem. Next visit to their house I am going to change the channel and do a firmware update. Thanks -lige
