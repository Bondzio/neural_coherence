<s> Hello everyone, I'm a photographer who needs a new computer. </s>
<s> I have a fair clue about computers, but I need a good workhorse for Photoshop CS5 and various other photographic applications, and I haven't kept up to date with the PC side of things. </s>
<s> I hate when people show up on photo-forums and just ask &quot;what should I get? </s>
<s> ?&quot;, without consulting any photographic website or do any research. </s>
<s> Therefore, I have tried, to the best of my ability, to do a bit of research in this ever-changing market of computers. </s>
<s> Initially I was inclined to just go with an iMac, but after a bit of research, I found that there's heck of a better deal, if you assemble your own PC. </s>
<s> What I would like you tech-experts to do, is run through the list and see if - with the listed config - I would run into any compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Also, if you see any components that you think would be overkill (or underkill, if that word exists), then feel free to suggest other solutions. </s>
<s> You'll notice that I haven't included mouse, keyboard or monitor. </s>
<s> I have these from my existing desktop and they will do me fine. </s>
<s> I would like to be so free, as to ask that this thread does NOT turn into a PC vs MAC bashing. </s>
<s> I've made up my mind and I'm not going with MAC for this computer, even though every other computer in my house is MAC. </s>
<s> I'm not biased and I purchase computers after what I need, not after what is trendy. </s>
<s> I sincerely thank you for your time, and look forward to your replies. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance? </s>
<s> Here are the specs I've found so far (Comments and questions I have are listed under each component). </s>
<s> I have found all components at TigerDirect.com - that's not to say that that's where I'll buy them, as, once I settle on a final config, I'll shop around for each component. </s>
<s> This spec, buying everything from TD.com, will run me about 1500 USD. </s>
<s> Barebone: Intel Core i7 4GHZ Overclocked Barebone PC - EVGA P55 FTW SLI Motherboard, Intel Core i7-875K Processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Cooler Master HAF 922 Chassis, Thermaltake 850W PSU, Performance Liquid Cooling (999 USD) OR AMD Six Core 4.0GHz Overclocked Barebone PC - ASUS M4A89GTD PRO Mobo, AMD Phenom II X6 1055T, 8GB DDR3 1600MHz RAM, Cooler Master HAF 922 Chassis, ULTRA 750W PSU, CoolIT ECO A.L.C. </s>
<s> Liquid Cooling (799 USD) I'll pay 200USD more for the Intel, and I can't really find any good reason to do that, since it seems the AMD processor is better specked. </s>
<s> Harddrives x 4: Western Digital WD1002FAEX Caviar Black Hard Drive - 1TB, 7200, 64MB, SATA 6Gbs (90 USD x 4) I went with these drives, as they seemed a good midrange solution. </s>
<s> I don't really need 4x1TB, but it seems that I don't pay that much extra for these drives vs. 320 GB drives. </s>
<s> Ideally, I'd get a couple of SSD's, but I find them too pricey still. </s>
<s> However, would this tower/motherboard be compatible with 3.5&quot; SSD's, should I decide to upgrade later? </s>
<s> Videocard: EVGA 01G-P3-1366-TR GeForce GTX 460 SE Video Card - 1GB GDDR5, PCI-Express 2.0, Dual DVI, Mini HDMI 1.4, DirectX 11 (150 USD) Again, this seemed a good solution, and it came recommended from a photo-blog: http://www.imagescience.com.au/kb/questions/141/Build+a+powerful+PC+for+Photoshop+and+other+imaging+applications DVD-burner : LG GH22NS50B DVD Writer - w/o Software, DVDRW, 22X, SATA, OEM (15 USD) I have one in my existing desktop, which I've never used, but at this price, I can't go wrong, I guess. </s>
<s> Operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64BIT Operating System Software - OEM DVD, English (110 USD) Really the only way to go with PC, I guess Various bits: I seem to remember reading that, when buying the hard drives, they don't come with the screws to install them in the tower. </s>
<s> Is that really true? </s>
<s> Finally, which modem should I get to connect to my wireless network in the house? </s>
<s> My network is using an Airport Extreme as router. </s>
<s> I've heard horror stories about connecting a pc to an Apple network. </s>
<s> Is there any good option for this? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Any answer is much appreciated. </s>
<s> After making too many machines I've yet to find my stuff to arrive with no screws. </s>
<s> In fact you find yourself often with too many. </s>
<s> Nice list and I've had NO HORROR connection wise to the Apple routers. </s>
<s> Yes there are those that turn on MAC filters and forget but here, no horrors. </s>
<s> Finally, I read all this but not a word about color control. </s>
<s> Wouldn't we after all this analysis for all this for PHOTO WORK want some sort of color calibrator? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Thanks a lot for your input. </s>
<s> You're absolutely right about the color control. </s>
<s> Sorry, I forgot to mention, I already have the Spyder 3 monitor calibrator. </s>
<s> So, all I need advice on, is the computer side of things. </s>
<s> Thanks for looking through the list and giving your comments. </s>
<s> What sort of network card can you recommend, or are they all the same? </s>
<s> Cheers... </s>
<s> Fantastic to read about the Spyder. </s>
<s> As to the network card, I will pick any 10/100/1000 card over 10/100 but no longer look for names on such things. </s>
<s> In fact I just use the onboard and 99.999% of the time that's what we stick with. </s>
<s> I think in the past decade we installed 2 network cards at the office. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I guess I'll be sticking with the onboard and see if I feel I'm missing anything. </s>
