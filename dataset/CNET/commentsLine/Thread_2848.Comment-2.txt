select start/run and type msconfig go the startup tab and uncheck any items related to anti virus, spyware or adware.
in fact, try removing any software that you recognize in the list that isn't part of windows itself.
reboot and see if that resolves the problem, if it does you can restore the items a few at a time until the problem occurs again, and you can narrow down the cause.
i have either installed or had clients install sp2 on a few hundred systems and not run into the problem even similar to what you describe.
