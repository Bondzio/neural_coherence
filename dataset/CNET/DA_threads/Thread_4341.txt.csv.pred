1.1.1	I have finally got a hold of the mobo that I ordered from Newegg.com.	St
1.1.2	It was quite easy to put in, thanks to Ray's heads up regarding the jumpers.	St
1.1.3	But I have problems already.	St
1.1.4	The new MB is a PC Chips' product, and its model # is M811LU.	St
1.1.5	I have put in everything onto the MB and into the new case without any problem.	St
1.1.6	And the MB recognizes every components quite easily.	St
1.1.7	But then problem came up, when I plug the ethernet cord into the RJ 45 jack, the screen went to the good old &quot;white text with blue background&quot; telling me either the hardware does not have the latest driver or it's not installed properly.	St
1.1.8	Though every card in the PCI slots were found and installed properly, and I am certain they all have the newest driver.	St
1.1.9	I have double checked over and over again, still no luck.	St
1.1.10	At first I thought it's just the on board LAN's not acting correctly, therefore, I disabled it and put in my own NIC.	St
1.1.11	Still, same blue screen with white text appeared when I plugged in the ethernet cable.	St
1.1.12	Can someone please help me verify and solve the problem, it'd be greatly appreciated.	Ques
1.1.13	Sincerely, Joe	St
1.2.1	But can only guess you moved some hard disk with an installed OS onto this new machine and &quot;Windows&quot; needs to be installed.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	What's at the other end of the ethernet cable?	St
1.4.1	I had enough of it, therefore, I formatted everything and reinstall what I had one by one.	St
1.4.2	And that's when I found out it was my Kerio Firewall was playing tricks on me.	St
1.4.3	Anyway, my problem is fixed now, and the MB is pretty decent as of now.	St
1.4.4	Thanks, Joe	St
