1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I have an HP Pavilion dv7-6059eo with Windows 7 64-bit .	St
1.1.3	My GPU is a Radeon HD 6770M .	St
1.1.4	I 've had this problem for 2 months without being able to fix it , so help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.5	I had AMD graphics drivers installed which I downloaded from the official HP driver site , but my programs and games often crashed because of my display driver restarting .	St
1.1.6	I googled the problem , and I found out that some other people had the problem as well , and that it could be because of outdated graphics drivers .	St
1.1.7	So I uninstalled the graphics drivers from HP and I downloaded some newer ones from the AMD website ( I now know that this is n't the proper way to upgrade them ) , and it worked , my GPU was n't crashing anymore , but after a while I wanted to switch back to the HP drivers , because of some functions missing .	St
1.1.8	So I uninstalled the drivers from AMD and I downloaded the HP drivers for my product again , however this time the installer does not seem to be able to install the drivers at all .	St
1.1.9	Right now I am using the GPU that 's built into the Intel CPU , and it 's obviously not good enough for gaming .	St
1.1.10	When I try to install the drivers , the only things that the installer wants to install are these : http : //img7.imageshack.us/img7/2889/ebeb7fb844f04b65aed6907.png And when it 's done , it says & quot ; Installation complete ( warnings occured during installation ) .	St
1.1.11	View Log for details. & quot ; But when I click & quot ; View Log & quot ; it does n't show any errors : http : //img15.imageshack.us/img15/4568/2a40459816524eb6aa76fdf.png And when I go to my installed programs , the only new program that seems to have appeared is this : http : //i.imgur.com/hj0pz1P.png I 've tried removing ALL AMD drivers before installing them again , but it still does n't work .	St
1.1.12	It 's like my computer does n't even know that I have an AMD GPU , or maybe it thinks that the drivers are already installed .	St
1.1.13	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	How I solved this before .	St
1.2.2	My advice is to use HP.COM and their chat or research more on the web ( I have n't done this recently so maybe folk have found a better way . )	St
1.2.3	What I did was a factory restore and then install the newer drivers .	St
1.2.4	It appears there are other drivers and apps that are required to make this work but HP did not document how to perform a clean install of Windows so I ca n't see what else is required .	St
1.2.5	It 's usually some chipset ( not the GPU ! )	St
1.2.6	driver and some helper app .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I suggest you install in & quot ; safe mode & quot ; as that 's more basic and not so demanding .	St
1.3.2	It may work to install that way , just be sure to select during the boot-up , pick the & quot ; with networking option & quot ; as well from the menu rather than simple safe mode alone .	St
1.3.3	If that does n't work , get a 100 % feel for what you have .	St
1.3.4	I use PCWizard 2012 , maybe 2013 now and install it .	St
1.3.5	Allow it to report what GPU and chipset you have .	St
1.3.6	ID'ing the right h/w may lead to what you really require .	St
1.3.7	I find that using the proper HP provided install s/w should done it right the 1st time , but laptops are a world of thier own .	St
1.3.8	You may want to use your SN # in order to get the right install s/w .	St
1.3.9	Last , i do n't see anything wrong using AMD provided installs from their support website .	St
1.3.10	Of course , again you need to get the right s/w as well .	St
1.3.11	You could also do a refresh of the OS install or use SFC /scannow .	Sug
1.3.12	If refreshing the OS providing it actually installs over itself AND does n't wipe clean the current install .	St
1.3.13	What it does is simply reloads the OS and returns everything whatever got corrupted .	St
1.3.14	The other method is using the & quot ; restore feature & quot ; and select a date prior to your 1st changes .	St
1.3.15	One method or the other should work , but again it depends as OEM type s/w can be too restrictive .	St
1.3.16	tada -- -- -Willy	St
