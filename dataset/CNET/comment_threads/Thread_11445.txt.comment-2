&quot;It doesn't know the words.&quot; Blatent ripoff quote from http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=60&threadID=212306&messageID=2275621 The other usual cause is a fan that is wearing out.
These are cheap and easy parts to replace.
And critical to keeping the machine running well.
It's also possible the fan runs faster when it's hotter.
In that case it's fine too.
