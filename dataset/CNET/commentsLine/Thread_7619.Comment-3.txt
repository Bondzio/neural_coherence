i started without it overclocked and it was fine.
although it was previously overclocked to 3.2 by its previous owner so that could be the problem but i don't know if he had the same problems with audio.
also the audio codec is realtech ac97 im using directx 9.0c, audio driver version 5.10.0.6200, audio controller sis 7012, and ac97 codec alc655 its a 6 channel card and when i change either the line in or mic port to a speaker i can get sound as if my computers speakers were the rear or center speakers.
however this only gives me sound to windows and certain games as i play savage and it either doesn't support surround sound or i haven't got it configured right.
any help would be appreciated.....i'll try anything other information: im using two speakers and a sub.
the speakers connect to the sub and there is av into it for sound from tv e.t.c but i have it to my computer using a cord that converts it.
i also tried reinstalling xp onto another hdd but that didn't work.
i think i just need to buy a new sound card.........do i?
