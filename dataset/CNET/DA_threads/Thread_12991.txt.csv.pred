1.1.1	My dad 's computer ( Compaq Evo D500 , running Windows XP Home Edition ) was having some operating system problems on which we had exhausted all other options , so we backed up his person files , and formatted and reinstalled windows .	St
1.1.2	We got almost everything working fine pretty quickly .	St
1.1.3	The computer is almost always connected by wire , which works perfectly fine right now , but when we have company , we do n't like having a long wire laying on the floor , so we like having the wireless available .	St
1.1.4	We 've had this wireless card ( Zonet ZEW1602 ) in for almost three years , and we have n't had a problem till now .	St
1.1.5	The first time we got it , we plugged it in , and it worked instantly .	St
1.1.6	We formatted , and reinstalled with the card still plugged in , and when we installed the software after the reinstall , the wireless client configuration utility says there is no card plugged in .	St
1.1.7	I am somewhat computer savvy , but I 'm more of a software problem kind of guy , so I do n't have too much experience with such problems .	St
1.1.8	We have looked into the device manager , and we do n't see anything of such a name as the wireless card .	St
1.1.9	I tried the add hardware and it did n't find anything .	St
1.1.10	I tried going into BIOS to see if there was anyway to enable the card , but I could n't find anything .	St
1.1.11	Any help to getting the wireless card working would be greatly appreciated .	St
