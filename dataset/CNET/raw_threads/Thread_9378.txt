I had to replace my old notebook battery since I used it a lot. It was not keeping the charge for even 5 minutes. During the time I also purchased new power cords to outlet & adapter. I tried to power on the notebook but to no success!! I double checked the battery connection & it was secured with the lock button in ON state. There is a Led light on the new adapter so it was turned green when plugged in but the notebook green large power light was not lit up? New battery & new power cords why is it not working? Does new battety require a charge before use or something? ? The old battery was depleted yet still on direct outlet power it was working fine. How will I make it to power on?

In light of that and probable long time operation with a bad battery or weak one, it came back to bit you. Understand, prolong use of battery will cause the internal charging ckt. to run and it may actually be worn-out or worse, broken. Yeah, that happens, as electronics being used and in &quot;heat stress&quot; situations are stressed until they become less than stable. Also, old stuff is old stuff and brings in its own faults to include anything under the sun. Alas, is the new adapter or all those new items really ready for your notebook. In other words are they whjat you reall need and accepted as so. If they vary or really aren't as capable or the wrong setup it will be quick to error or as you found out. Also, is the battery really a new one or rebuild one. If you can get your hands on a friend's &quot;exact same charging parts&quot; use them and check results, as that is about the only way other than checking specs to see if the items you brought are capable. tada -----Willy

Sometimes the mfgr uses a small seperate board and others make it part of the system/motherboard. When batteries reach the end of their useful lives, the take more current to charge and can burn the board, battery and charger inverter unit. Replacement of both battery and converter leaves the internals being the failure. I have a Dell with the same trouble and a new MOBO is needed, not expensive but over ten years old, best left for more dire days.

You claim the old adapter was working so why not step back to that adapter and leave out the battery. If that fails, it needs repairs. And in parting I'm assuming you read about the generic reset noted in the CNET Laptop Troubleshooting forum welcome post. Bob

I checked the voltage output of the connector and check the connection and everything appears to LOOK ok...but yet, it won't work. I end up getting a Dell replacement PS and it works like a charm. So you might have the same situation. Get a same replacement. Good luck.

13008	7	603029	5508329	5506341	Willy	10/15/13 9:06 AM	1.38182796E12	Just a FYI *NOTE*	This post has been here awhile and like to make a note of interest to anyone that gets a laptop adapter. Most OEM adapters are labeled on their backside what they expect to offer. Often enough one adapter is pretty much like another especially if from the same maker(Dell, Gateway, etc.) but that is not always an given. I mention that because the sale of so-called universal adapters that have all the connections and maybe slide voltage sw. could be less than desirable for your laptop. These are too generic though they certainly work for many laptops just not all. They may simply lack the amps or desired voltage required to &quot;turn-ON&quot; the laptop brought for. It's working but excluding any prior faults of the laptop itself, it just isn't cutting it. However, if you shop for a replacement laptop adapter, make darn sure it's rated or compatible for your laptop model-XYZ. That way if it doesn't work you can return it or get a refund, etc.. If on the other hand you try one adapter from one laptop maker on yet another laptop model, don't expect it to work it just may not. Again, provided nothing is wrong with the laptop shop for a direct compatible replacement. tada ------Willy
