1.1.1	My laptop is hooked up to our office lan wirelessly .	St
1.1.2	I want to connect an ethernet device ( not wireless but IP addressing fully configurable ) to my laptop so that i can then see the device elsewhere in my office .	St
1.1.3	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.4	I have been playing with IP addresses with no luck so far .	St
1.2.1	A printer or NAS drive perhaps ?	Ques
1.2.2	Maybe if you explain what you 're wanting to do .	St
1.2.3	You can certainly connect an Ethernet cable to your NIC jack and to another device .	St
1.2.4	To get them working together , they both need IP addresses which you will probably need to do statically .	St
1.3.1	Hi Steven , I have a VSD which has an inbuilt http page which i can bring up on my laptop .	St
1.3.2	However from other stations on my network it is not accessible .	St
1.3.3	If I bridge ( using XP ) my wireless and local are connection ( broadcom ) then the device is pingable , but not accessible by my laptop or the broader network .	St
1.4.1	Is help from your IT dept .	St
1.4.2	an option ?	Ques
1.4.3	I would think it could be wirelessly bridged directly to the network .	St
1.4.4	If your network 's router has some addresses reserved for static assignment , I 'd think you could configure it that way and create a link to it in your browser .	St
1.5.1	We are a small automation company ( 4 people ) .	St
1.5.2	If i crack this we can implement the concept more broadly on our systems .	St
1.5.3	Bridging seems like a route to take but when i do this it my wireless indicates it is connected , but is unable to connect ( to the other network computers and the internet ) .	St
1.5.4	Is this an ip addressing issue of the bridge that I have now created ?	Ques
1.6.1	Wire would be best but you lose portability of that 's of importance .	St
1.6.2	I 'm not sure that bridging through your laptop can be easily done .	St
1.6.3	Frankly , I 've never tried that other than to create an AP from another PC .	St
1.6.4	It would seem best to connect it directly to the whole network than require a dependency on another machine .	St
1.6.5	Bridging to router should not be that hard .	St
1.6.6	You need two capable devices and create an association between them .	St
1.6.7	You can set up your DHCP server ( generally your router ) to provide some addresses dynamically but reserve a range for those that need fixed addresses .	St
1.6.8	I 'll be limited in what I can offer in the way of specifics as I 've only done this ( minimally ) with printers as single devices .	St
1.6.9	It works with these .	St
