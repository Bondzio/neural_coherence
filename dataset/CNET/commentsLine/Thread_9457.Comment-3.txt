30ft is about the maximum range usually stated by rf wireless keyboards (my own logitech can easily beat 20ft, and through walls!).
mice rf range is far less (mine begins to get lost in the maze at about 8ft) though.
the main problem here is that bluetooth range isn't any better with an effective range of....wait for it...32ft which maybe means a careful and extended central position for the receiver would be required for either (oh, the logicalness of it all!
; ) so you could walk around it, without going near either of the effective limits.
geebee.
