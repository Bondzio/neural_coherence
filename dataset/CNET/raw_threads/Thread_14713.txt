Every time I power up with the graphics card installed, I get no video at all. I have tried disabling and deleting the current VGA adapter. When I try to load the driver without the graphics card installed(from the supplied CD or from the Web site) I get an error saying &quot;the detected VGA does not seem to be XFX's product.&quot; And I can't try to load the driver with the card installed since I get no video on the screen. I exchanged the graphic card with the same problem, so the card shouldn't be the problem. I'm running Windows Vista Home Basic, with an ALTUS P5GC-MX/1333 motherboard and an Intel Core2Duo E6750 (2.6GHz) CPU. Relevent BIOS settings: Plug and play - Yes PCI Latency Timer - 64 Allocate IRQ to PCI VGA - Yes Palette snooping - Disabled Boot graphic adapter priority - PCI Express/Int-VGA Internal graphic mode select - Enabled, 8MB Previously, I did not have a graphics card installed and the PCI-E slot had not been used. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

But, what PSU (Power Supply) are you using. If the card is not getting enough power it will not work properly. This is a simple awnser and I dont know if its the right one but, it was worth a try.

I also don't know much about graphics cards, but the specs say the card requires a min of 350W and my PSU is 380W. 380 is not much more than 350 and I guess it could affect the performance of the card, but I think I should still see some video on the screen if it meets the min.

I am running Vista home premium and after several attemps to get that card working, I gave up, took it back and re-installed my old card without any problems. Your setup should be plug and play as mine is, but it would be a good idea to check the BIOS for onboard graphics being disabled.
