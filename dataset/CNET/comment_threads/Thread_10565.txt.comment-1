I have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor's screen.
Its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work.
The screen is a Mitusbishi Diamond Pro 900u.
Is there a way to fix this?
I know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical.
There must be something I can buy that can fix this.
Does anyone know of such a product?
Thanks in advance, Dave
