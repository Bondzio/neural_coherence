System shows 3.25gb installed. Occassionally I get error messages saying the system has run out of available memory and I must close the program I am running. This happens a lot when I am running MS Flight Sim X and it just happened again when I was editing a large photoshop file(75mb). It wasn't a big concern when happening with the game ... but now it's happening with stuff related to my job...I need to get it figured out. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also..Am is my system still utilizing the 4gb of installed memory even though it only shows 3.25? Is there a tweak to fix this?

Remember that I don't duplicate easy to find web pages. It's not that I can't but the forum policies mandate that I don't plagiarize plus by doing the research on your own you gain a better understanding of the issues. Bob

I added another gig of ram which gives me 3gig of duel channel and did the /3gig switch and there is a noticeable increase in speed when using Photoshop Your suggestion saved me $500.00 and a lot of time. I am very grateful for your help. Wayne

The fact that the system reports 3.25GB of RAM when 4GB is fitted is because you are running 32bit windows and it is limited to seeing only 3.25GB of real physical RAM. 32 bits will only represent addreses up to 4GB (4,294,967,295) and if all this was attrbuted to RAM there would be no addresses left in the max range for Graphics card memory or any other peripheral equipment with it's own memory, all of which has to be mapped within that maximum range If you want to use all of your installed RAM you need to switch to 64 bit windows.

I'm running Vista Business on a Pentium D 820, dual core processor. It would not run properly without a second GB of RAM (tow GB total). This seams to also apply to most other PCs as well. If this is correct and the 32bit systems only go to 3.5GB of RAM then there short .5GB of RAM if your running a quad core processor. It might be necessary to upgrade to the 64bit version to get the full 4GB to run the OS. Understand? Looks like an MS Ooops to me. ....................................................... 64bit OSs are available here if you meet the requirements for the upgrade you can receive it for the price of shipping and handling.

Choose the boot tab, choose the drive your using from the list, click both the maximum processors and memory boxes, set them according to your needs, then click &quot;apply&quot; followed by OK, restart the system.
