1.1.1	Hi , for some weeks now , Im searching for a solution to stream live video from a wearable device ( glasses , headset ) to a windows system for recording .	St
1.1.2	Requirement is complete freedom from & lt ; span dir= & quot ; auto & quot ; & gt ; any LAN .	St
1.1.3	Most promising possibility yet seems to be the looxcie camera http : //www.looxcie.com/ .	St
1.1.4	The android market app promisis an integration into browsers to come soon : ( https : //play.google.com/store/apps/details ? id=com.looxcie.live.android & amp ; feature=more_from_developer # ? t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwMiwiY29tLmxvb3hjaWUubGl2ZS5hbmRyb2lkIl0 ) Currently it seems to be streaming from mobile to mobile only , though .	Ques
1.1.5	Whats interesting is that even the CIA starts to get interested in the device , as the spend a lot of money on it recently ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/25-cutting-edge-companies-funded-by-the-central-intelligence-agency-2012-8 ? op=1 ) .	St
1.1.6	Thanks for replies .	Polite
1.2.1	You 've found a few but the problem remains about the buyer 's expectations .	St
1.2.2	For example a few that do n't know about data transfer limits want 1080p video but then are upset about the costs .	St
1.2.3	It 's currently about 1 million and a custom job .	St
1.2.4	Consumer grade stuff ?	Ques
1.2.5	You 've seen it .	St
1.2.6	So my question to you is why did n't you buy it ?	Ques
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes , it seems definetely the best solution for an limited budget .	St
1.3.2	But I have seen too many companys promise future features to just believe in a statement on android market .	St
1.3.3	Its definitely most important to be able to watch and record the stream on a pc .	St
1.4.1	Wait till they deliver or use the apple iphone in the meantime .	St
1.4.2	I 'm sure there are other solutions out there .	St
1.4.3	But I wo n't give a nod to any because I 've found such to be too finicky for most .	St
1.4.4	That is , what happens when the device ca n't connect .	St
1.4.5	Most folk have high expectations and low budgets .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	http : //gizmodo.com/5533916/giz-explains-why-streaming-video-over-3g-sucks The multi-million buck solution I 've seen used more than one 3g link ( aggregation ) to get enough throughput .	St
1.5.2	Your average Joe will not be doing that and will often whine when they try the usual off the shelf stuff .	St
1.5.3	- & gt ; If you are smart you do the research and then move back to what works .	St
1.5.4	Record what you want then upload it .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Youre right with your estimate .	St
1.6.2	Somehow it was my fault not be clear about my goals : Im no movie-maker or anything who wants hd / premium quality material to be recorded .	St
1.6.3	All this is just part of an experiment ( university ) , where the viewer at the at home will be pleased when the area and persons around camera are recognizable .	St
1.6.4	Would you still say , in this case , that the pure data amount would be so much to just throw away the idea ?	Ques
1.6.5	Thank you .	St
1.7.1	But my background involves DVR for security systems .	St
1.7.2	We push video over wireless and have programmers and more to get it working .	St
1.7.3	I ca n't know if you are simply a consumer or someone that dives in and writes code and builds hardware .	St
1.7.4	That 's why I ca n't give you any good news .	St
1.7.5	It seems you want to buy something and play with it rather than build it , program it and such .	St
1.7.6	Sorry if this offends you in any way .	St
1.7.7	Bob	St
