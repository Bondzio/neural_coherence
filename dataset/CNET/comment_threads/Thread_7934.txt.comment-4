I would tell you to add up all the loads from all your devices and match it against the wattage output of your power supply, but this would add to the confusion since you do not know how to do this by lookinng at the data plates on all your devices.However, that information is readly available if you google for it.
Instead I will refer you to: http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=31105&seqNum=9 PC Repair and Maintenance: In-depth Look at Power Supply Be sure to look at all the articles.
Also, look at: http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.asp?p=339053 Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design Note that Dell has seen the light and on their newer machines they use a standard power supply, but do not trust that, check your system carefully.
You may have to order a more robust supply from Dell if it is one of those propriortary units.
In the meantime, disconnect a couple of devices such as your CD and Floppy and see if the HD is detected.
This would indicate if you have an inadequate power supply.
