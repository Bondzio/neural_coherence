<s> Hello all, I've been looking into buying a 900-1300 dollar desktop. </s>
<s> I will be using this desktop for some gaming, editing and basic processes. </s>
<s> I plan on buying a high resolution 27+ inch monitor later on so a good graphics card that can handle high resolutions is a must. </s>
<s> I do not want to build my own pc, because at the moment i do not feel confident in my well, abilities. </s>
<s> Heres what i customized on HP i'll put my questions about each part in parentheses. </s>
<s> HP elite HPE-480t Intel Core I-7 930 8 GB 1033 Ram Primary HD- 80gb Solid State Drive ( I've heard that formatting this type of drive in Raid 0 format makes it very fast but makes transfer rates lower. </s>
<s> I only plan on putting windows 7 and a few other speed oriented files on here though. </s>
<s> How do i put this drive in raid 0? </s>
<s> what is raid 0? </s>
<s> i have no idea please help here haha ) Secondary Drive- 500GB 7200 rpm HDD Graphics card- Nvidia GeForce GTX 460 ( I plan on installing a 2nd GTX 460 later on for the SLI hookup. </s>
<s> Is this easy to do? </s>
<s> will i have to install a new power supply to the PC? </s>
<s> if so which PSU's are good? </s>
<s> Is SLI worth it? </s>
<s> I want to have a 3 monitor set up and if there is a better combination of others cards feel free to advise ) Sound card- Integrated Sound ( dont know if its worth the extra money for the sound blaster card ) Networking - Wireless N lan card ( should i get bluetooth with it? </s>
<s> i want a bluetooth headset but don't they come with a USB bluetooth plugin? ) </s>
<s> I researched the motherboard and its a X58 chipset with 2 X16 pcie 2.0 slots i believe, so i shouldn't have to worry about SLI / Eyefinity compatibility. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions that i overlooked or didnt ask about that beginners should know would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> I've held back long enough for HP to correct their stance on an in warranty issue on a laptop but the last talk ended with &quot;that's not supported.&quot; It was a simple issue that my HP laptop would not boot when a Spring HTC EVO 4G phone was plugged in. </s>
<s> While I know why it does me no good as only HP can issue a fixed BIOS. </s>
<s> Instead the choice was to tell me it was not supported. </s>
<s> Since HP can't warrant or support their machines, it's time to move on to those that will. </s>
