1.1.2	the problem that i have is finding a low profile power supply of minimum 400wts .	St

1.6.1	$ 225 ... UGH !	St
1.6.2	Believe this is the PSU part number '146870914 ' If it were mine ... .I 'd double check the SONY PSU part number , take measurements , see if it wired generically and look for a generic replacement .	St
1.6.3	$ 225 for a 400W PSU is absurd and a SONY GOTCHA !	St
1.6.4	If you ca n't find an economical replacement ... may be better to use the money toward a newer PC .	St

1.7.1	I purchased from PC Power & Cooling..website..www.pcpowercooling.com/ I rebuilt my old DELL Dimension 2350..which was a P4 [ 1.8GHz ] at 200-watts..and placed a PC Power & Cooling 400-watt in the Tower..perfect fit..just over $ $ 200.00/I now run a P4 [ 531 ] 3.0GHz..plus a new Mobo.. Video cards are for Advanced Users from what I have read.. and 600-watts seems to be the minimum on having the NEED for a Video Card.. .. Power Supply 's come in Form Factor..plus you want to measure the one in your PC..the serious part is about useing a Power-On Button..	St
1.7.2	Some PSU incorporate a Power-On Button..some DON'T/the latter would need the resource of your Front Panel Power Switch.. .. And you Do Not want to eliminate any LED 's that inform of PC Operation.. ..	St
1.7.3	Check on Form Factor.. and the 2 x 10 or the 2 x 12 Configuration ... .for the MAIN Plug on the Mother Board..	St
1.7.4	I saw little differance in upgradeing..except that extra wires are there.. ..there are some New Specs on Power Hook-up on the Board.. Research it..its not too difficult.. Start w/FORM FACTOR .	St
1.8.1	MicroATX supply.n Since most MicroATX mobos use onboard video and sound and share memory for video they have supplies as low as 145 Watts .	St
1.8.2	If you need 400 watts for the hardware , I wqould doubt that you could cool the system adequately in that small case .	St
