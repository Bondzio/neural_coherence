Hello, I have some computers in a workgroup and can't access my Windows XP machine from the Windows 2000 ones.
If I try to browse the XP computer, it prompts for a user name and password but won't log me in even when I try to log in as Administrator.
I can, however, get to the windows 2000 computers from my XP one.
Have any of you ever ran into a problem similar to this?
Thanks, Chris
