<s> media that works with a BenQ dual layer DVD drive? </s>
<s> The DW1655, to be precise. </s>
<s> I have Verbatim and Memorex. </s>
<s> Neither works. </s>
<s> I'd hate to have to buy media just find out which one works. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Maybe not all softwares works with double layer.Just think out loud. </s>
<s> I generally use CD-R or CD-RW media to record songs from my iTunes library. </s>
<s> I installed my new DVD drive and had some initial troubles with it. </s>
<s> I wanted to see if it would be an all-around useful recording drive. </s>
<s> It records to DVD+RW just fine. </s>
<s> I don't have a big enough file to test the dual layer functionality. </s>
<s> My Lite-On DVD recorder has yet to come across a media it doesn't like. </s>
<s> But, of course, it isn't a dual layer unit. </s>
<s> I found a firmware update for my BenQ drive released just yesterday, 1-20-06. </s>
<s> I flashed it in and Verbatim CD-RW will work with the drive now. </s>
<s> Still can't get Memorex CD-RW to work with it. </s>
<s> The Memorex is rather old, though. </s>
