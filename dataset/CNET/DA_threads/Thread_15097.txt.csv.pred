1.1.1	when I search through the web I always see DDR memory with some numbers assigned to them .	St
1.1.2	For instance , 256MB DDR memory PC3200 400MHZ or PC2700 333MHZ .	St
1.1.3	As far as I know even the motherboards supporting 333MHZ can work with 400MHZ memory but in this case the memories will function at 333MHz thus , buying memories at a higher-than-supported speed becomes useless .	St
1.1.4	How can I understand whether my motherboard supports 400MHZ DDR memory ?	Ques
1.2.1	describe your motherboard as in manufacturer and model #	St
1.3.1	The mtrbd .	St
1.3.2	specs are provided via the manual or the support website for your model .	St
1.3.3	Understand the memory mapping as sometimes certain conditions must be present .	St
1.3.4	In general if the mtrbd .	St
1.3.5	supports FSB of 333Mhz .	St
1.3.6	though you can install DDR PC3200/400Mhz , you can use it only at 333Mhz .	St
1.3.7	If the mtrbd .	St
1.3.8	can in fact use PC3200 at FSB of 400Mhz in may want certain memory slot ( s ) used only or all are supported .	St
1.3.9	Also , the level of the cpu class installed will determine the final setup as the mtrbd .	St
1.3.10	using its & quot ; automode & quot ; setting may pick the best overall operation or at least the safest one with lack of problem ( s ) .	St
1.3.11	These mtrbds .	St
1.3.12	can be in most cases be & quot ; manually & quot ; setup to increase its operational speed but may lock-up or outright fail if pushed too far but a default mode should recover it .	St
1.3.13	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
