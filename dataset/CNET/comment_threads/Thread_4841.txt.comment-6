OEM motherboards of well known for having &quot;Bulging Capacitors&quot; These will sometimes cause the system to shutdown when the CPU is throttled up, such as during a Bios post check of the CPU.
But it could also be heat related.
I would just look at all your capacitors and check to see if any are bulging, if you don't know what the difference is check out this.
