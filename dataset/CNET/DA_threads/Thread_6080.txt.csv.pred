1.1.1	I own the following 500gb external hard drive , attached constantly to my Windows XP PC , saving the bulk of my non-EXE or program files ( docs , pics , etc ) effectively on a constant backup .	St
1.1.2	I 've owned it for about two years and never had any problems with it until now .	St
1.1.3	http : //www.amazon.co.uk/Western-Digital-Elements-500GB-External/dp/B000OS54TA The drive is formatted to Fat32 - got it that way and just never reformatted it .	St
1.1.4	Now , with just 107gb of its space used up , I try to save one image file today to my very large ( over 19,000 files not counting subdirectories ) image folder and this happens .	St
1.1.5	Over and over .	St
1.1.6	http : //yfrog.com/j3clipboard01dlp The drive seems to hate saving files *with a long filename* , which I gather is a complaint of some external hard drives .	St
1.1.7	But the problem is : Why is it complaining about this NOW ?	Ques
1.1.8	Up until now I 've been able to save any file whatsoever onto there with any filename I wanted .	St
1.1.9	There are files on there with names like '00711385595004928.jpg ' , really .	St
1.1.10	So why does this cause error now ?	Ques
1.1.11	The actual size of the picture does n't seem to make any difference , just the filename !	St
1.1.12	If the name is short , images do save onto there .	St
1.1.13	1 .	St
1.1.14	Is there any way I can get this drive to accept long filenames once again ?	Ques
1.1.15	2 .	St
1.1.16	Would reformatting to NTFS help ?	Ques
1.1.17	Would it involve deleting or corrupting anything ?	Ques
1.1.18	3 .	St
1.1.19	Would using more subdirectories help ?	Ques
1.1.20	Thanks in advance !	St
1.2.1	Try a new folder .	St
1.2.2	Stuffing many files into one folder is frankly , dangerous .	St
1.2.3	Even more on FAT32 volumes .	St
1.2.4	Yes we can usually convert to NTFS with no loss but the moderators all know & quot ; We only lose what we did n't backup. & quot ; So before I go one step further , could you tell where the backup copies are ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	1 .	St
1.3.2	ATM , the external hard drive has no backups ( & lt ; _ & lt ; ; & gt ; _ & gt ; ; ) .	St
1.3.3	All files stored on there are just there ; it 's where my main collected files are kept .	St
1.3.4	If it comes to that I can easily copy all/most/some of them over to my internal C : drive , however it take up like 75 % of the free space , so I 'd prefer to do it sparingly .	St
1.3.5	It would take some hours , but I have some hours free .	St
1.3.6	2 .	St
1.3.7	I could also use more subdividing my Image folder , which is indeed far too stuffed .	St
1.3.8	It already has about 30 subs .	St
1.3.9	If I use either of these methods , would I be able to save files freely once again ?	Ques
1.3.10	I could do both , but is it going to be necessary to also backup ?	Ques
1.3.11	Again , would reformatting to NTFS solve my problem , or help is some way ?	Ques
1.3.12	( BTW , my C : drive is NTFS )	St
1.4.1	I know better than to convert it to NTFS .	St
1.4.2	Yes it should fix it but since there is no backup the conversion while it works 99.99 % of the time is it worth the risk of no backup ?	Ques
1.4.3	Only you can answer that .	St
1.4.4	Since I know the risk I wo n't tell you how to convert .	St
1.4.5	But you can find out with a google like & quot ; Windows XP How to convert to NTFS ? & quot ; Sorry to hear another no backup story .	St
1.4.6	These rarely end well .	St
1.4.7	Need evidence ?	Ques
1.4.8	Look at entries in this very forum .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well , as I 've said , I CAN easily back it up - I just need to copy the files over to C. That 's a backup , yes ?	Ques
1.5.2	I do n't want/need to reformat C , it 's NTFS already .	St
1.5.3	So really I 'm not taking any risks .	St
1.5.4	I 'll certainly make a backup before messing around with my external .	St
1.5.5	OK ?	Ques
1.5.6	Thankyou for your advice .	St
1.5.7	You are right about my irresponsibility regarding the drive .	St
1.6.1	For not beating me up over the repeating comments about you know what .	St
1.6.2	Hope it all turns out great !	St
