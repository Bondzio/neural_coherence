<s> I was wondering if anyone can tell me about the Internet services/connections in Europe, especifically in France. </s>
<s> I want to get a laptop with a wireless card and ethernet/internet connection, but I don't know how their services and connections are. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Wifi is spotty as in any town. </s>
<s> There is no central web site that maps it out for you since... there is no law that such be disclosed or mapped. </s>

<s> Will I get wireless service without a problem in Caen, Le Havre and Paris? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot; Will I get wireless service without a problem in Caen, Le Havre and Paris? </s>
<s> &quot; That's easy. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> It's only good within a hundred feet of some access point. </s>
<s> Just like where you are, it will be spotty. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> will it still be crappy even though their cafes and universities have access? </s>
<s> I can still get online though, right? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> so i travel to europe for a month, you think it would be pointless to even take my labtop and try and get hot spots at cafes or something to check my email and such??? </s>

<s> which I don't know the answer to, having not been there or done that myself. </s>
<s> Is USA wifi technical spec for radio channels, etc. </s>
<s> (which are subject to U.S. FCC requirements) the same as in France (subject to their sovreign governmental regulations). </s>
<s> In other words, will a wifi card in a laptop purchased in the USA connect successfully to an EU hotspot? </s>
<s> Or will it be like FM radio where US stations are on the odd numbered decimals of the frequecy while EU (or is it UK) stations are on the even numbered decimals, so our &quot;standard&quot; radios don't work over there. </s>
<s> One thing I've noticed when downloading firmware and drivers for wireless stuff is that some of it is region-specific. </s>
<s> I guess, in the worst case, you'd have to buy a new PCCard wifi adapter that conforms to the local radio requirements when you get there. </s>
<s> But it would be so much more convenient if US and EU radio specs were the same so the equipment would work on both sides of the big pond. </s>
<s> dw </s>
<s> I have bought several Laptop, desktop, access point and wifi card from UK and USA, they all work together with the existing network, in singapore and their neighboring country. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> USA using 110v... while many other use 220v. </s>
<s> AND the powerline jack differences. </s>
<s> So you still need to buy a power and jack converter.. </s>
<s> It because many product are sold only to specific country/region.. so its depends on your product Serial number.. it might also make you download locally,(supposedly) more faster. </s>
<s> i.e some HP desktop that sold in Asia Pasific have something like 'AP' in the end of the product name... </s>
<s> I have used an international roaming internet account for several years. </s>
<s> It can cover connections by dialup, ISDN, Or WiFi/hotspot. </s>
