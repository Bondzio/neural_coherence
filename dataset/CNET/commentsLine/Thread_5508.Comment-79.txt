if this is happening please be sure this data is backed up .
if this is the only copy of the data you have then there is a real risk you may lose it if the drive fails.
even if this is a backup copy of your data from your computer's hard drive, if this external drive fails then you no longer have a backup.
please consider making duplicate backups so that you always have one or two other copies.
also you have asked for advice in a question and answer discussion.
you might want to create your own personal discussion in these forums so that any help and advice offered is specific to you and your system.
if you do, please be sure to give details and specs of your system.
i hope that helps.
