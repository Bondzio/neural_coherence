thanks.
i placed an order for the hard drive i linked to, the caviar green one.
it should be here within a few days.
i couldn't find exact instructions on how to replace my old hard drive with the new one, once i get it.
there are a lot of tutorials online but a point in the right direction would be great.
hopefully it all works out when i get my hd.
