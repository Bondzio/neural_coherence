<s> I built a 3 Ghz P4 system @ 800Fsb, 400W power supply, with a Gigabyte GA-8S648FX motherboard, 512MB PC3200 RAM, and a Radeon 9600 graphics card. </s>
<s> It's been running fine, but NOW, without warning, it blacks out and shuts off in the middle of working. </s>
<s> I try to click the power button to turn it back on.. and NOTHING! </s>
<s> dead. </s>
<s> if I remove the battery on the Mboard, and reinstall it, the BIOS is reset and the system powers up again. </s>
<s> until a few hours/days later, out of the blue.. it will do the same thing and I need to uninstall and reinstall the battery to reset the BIOS. </s>
<s> ??????? </s>
<s> there seems to be no performance issues before the comp shorts out, so I do not think it's my MB/RAM/or CPU. </s>
<s> Power is still supplied to my optical mouse even when it blacks out, so I am skeptical if it's my power supply, but I have heard of crappy PSs being shipped with custom cases. </s>
<s> any one experienced this? </s>
<s> any thoughts? </s>
<s> The power supply is a suspect. </s>
<s> But before you try anything else, you need to prove that the problem is not &quot;overheating&quot;. </s>
<s> Remove the side panel from the computer and set a house fan where it will blow into the computer. </s>
<s> Run the computer with the side removed (external fan blowing) and see it the problem changes or reoccurs. </s>
<s> .. </s>
<s> Some motherboards do that if the temperature rises too high. </s>
<s> EASY to figure out by just leaving the cover off. </s>
<s> 400 Watts can be very slim. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ documented some 9 out of 21 supplies didn't meet there own specifications. </s>
<s> Hint! </s>
<s> Yours probably doesn't either. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ to see if you have enough Watts and factor in you need 50 to 100 more for generic supplies since the first article showed they fib. </s>

<s> my system idles at about 40 degrees C, pretty normal. </s>
<s> when I render (I do a lot of 3D work) out some projects (this is when it seems to black out on me) it rides upwards of 50+ deg C. 400W, even if it proved to be 300 or 350 should be adequate, since I only have 1 HD, 1 Video Card, 1 fan, and modem card hooked up to it. </s>
<s> Not many perephrials, and I don't overclock. </s>
<s> get this though, maybe this will shed some light in on the subject: the machine doens't shut down.. when i shut it off from Windows XP Pro, it goes through the shutting down process, and then REBOOTS! </s>
<s> never completely powers off, depsite BIOS configurations. </s>
<s> It worked fine the first 2 months. </s>
<s> But know, I have to hold down the power button to get the power to shut off the system. </s>
<s> Is this supporting a power supply problem? </s>

<s> The test for this issue is simple. </s>
<s> Have you removed the case cover to find out? </s>

<s> It's not only the Watts that matter, but how well a supply responds to an increase in demand. </s>

<s> A 3 GHz P4 would have a warranty. </s>
<s> Why not make it the vendors problem? </s>
