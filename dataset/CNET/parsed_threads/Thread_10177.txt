<s> What a pain. </s>
<s> I have a Seagate and Maxtor-drive system with an 80-pin cable installed. </s>
<s> I've tried two drives and yet I get a &quot;no 80 conductor cable installed&quot; error message. </s>
<s> Is this a mainboard issue? </s>
<s> It just happened one day when I turned on the computer, though I've had compatability problems since I got the Seagate. </s>
<s> Don't know if it's coincidence or not. </s>
<s> I've installed millions of hard disks and have never had this happen. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Thanks, but no, the cable is in -- blue section plugged into MB. </s>
<s> Both drives are set to Cable Select. </s>
<s> Perhaps I should set the second one as Slave. </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> Nothing I do will keep this error message from appearing. </s>
<s> The cable's plugged in correctly (blue plug into the MB). </s>
<s> Both drives were set to cable select. </s>
<s> I even changed the last one to SLAVE and it made no difference. </s>
<s> Also can't find much on the Internet to address this except that many people seem to be experiencing this. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html I'd see if the BIOS is up to date or maybe these are very old drives? </s>

<s> Nope, both Maxtor drives are identical and one was working beautifully as my permanent second drive. </s>
<s> Then one day came the dreaded knocking sound. </s>
<s> I noticed I was getting the error message on bootup and swapped the drive for the second one. </s>
<s> No knocking sound, but though the disk IS recognized in the bios, I still get the same error message. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to believe it may be a MB problem. </s>
<s> I may just have to get a massive single drive or swap to the more modern SATA drives. </s>
<s> But if it's a MB problem, I may be playing with fire. </s>
<s> Any other recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
