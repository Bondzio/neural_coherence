each dvd drive has a decoder supplied by the dvd drive maker or motherboard maker that is specific to that drive or mobo.
i had the same issue on win 2000; try downloading powerdvd (trial) which has a software decoder built in rather than having to buy a $15 or $30 decoder for windows media player and other software.. if you can't install the original motherboard and system drivers (which you can't because hp doesn't support that on your pavilion) i know that because i have the hp a1250n, the same family.
hp only supports the media center edition they supply, and no other drivers.
