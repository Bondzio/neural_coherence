<s> I have recently purchased a Samsung BD-5300 smart blu ray, plugged in the ethernet cable, all was fine, I am able to download apps, watch youtube, bbc iplayer etc, but a box keeps appearing saying smarthub needs to be updated I click ok, then another box appears telling me no connection and to check network settings ? </s>
<s> Network must be fine if I am able to download apps and watch online ? </s>
<s> Try downloading the latest firmware (released July 2) to a thumb drive and load it to your BD player. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply, I tried the fw update but I have the current latest fw </s>
<s> Samsung has had server issues (they don't like to read that, they call it something else.) </s>
<s> And we know that the time it takes the new server address time to get the addresses out to the DNS at the ISPs. </s>
<s> I'm going to break my rule about acronyms here and ask you to google acronyms that are new to you first, then ask if you can't find them. </s>
<s> With that out of the way, Samsung network issues are plentiful and vary depending on the country. </s>
<s> Since governments mandate that certain content does not flow freely (a discussion on its own!) </s>
<s> we have to hear more about what country this is in as well as try a few things. </s>
<s> My favorite easy fix is to set our router to use the Google DNS (see google and type in Google DNS for info.) </s>
<s> I'd start with that as well as setting the date and time on the BD 5300. </s>

<s> Thanks for the info I looked on google regarding google DNS and it said in control pnael under network to change my DNS to some numbers which I have done, I am going to try the B/R shortly to see if it will connect, I am in the UK if that helps </s>
<s> I know that Netflix's roll out has been bumpy and with that you have Samsung's own issues. </s>
<s> Be sure to check all the date and times in all devices involved too. </s>

<s> Just checked again, got the message about updates but no network connection, date and time is also correct </s>
<s> It means that Samsung's servers are likely out of whack offline. </s>
<s> It does not mean anything is wrong with your network. </s>
<s> If it's like before it goes away when Samsung fixes it. </s>
