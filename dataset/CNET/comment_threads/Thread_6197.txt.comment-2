I don't think that matters much, if at all, even with USB 3.
May I give you a warning?
Experience has proven that external hard disks are quite unreliable and error prone.
Too many members here thought they could be used as storage, forgot about a backup (a copy on one or two other media) and lost everything.
So better buy 2 disks and copy to both.
Three would be even better, especially if you keep the third one on a safe place outside of your home or office (or where-ever those 3 other disks are).
