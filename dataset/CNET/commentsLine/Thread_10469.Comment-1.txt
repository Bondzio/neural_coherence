hi all, i've been wondering how is the reliability of acer desktop computers these days.
are people that have them happy with their purchase.
any issues?
i'm looking to get a new computer (nothing major) and the price that i'm seeing here and there seems ok. i'm looking around the web and it's hard to have a clear picture as to how their desktops are.
thx for the info
