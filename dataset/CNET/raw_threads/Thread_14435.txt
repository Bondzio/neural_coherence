I found this really good external hard drive and its nice, sleek, and best of all CHEAP! and its from LaCie so thats a plus. But anyway, I'm a little concerned because this particular hard drive that i want does not have a fan in it. I really don't want it to die on my any time soon. And i am more than likely going to have the hard drive running all the time, as i am going to be putting some frequently used media on it. So, this questions is mostly directed to people who actually own this model, but do you think that it will die on my quickly because it doesnt have a fan. It has a little ventilation system on the back of it, but i guess it's just holes to let air in and out. Here's a link from amazon with the description. Scroll down a little and you can see what the ventilation is like. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112BKM8/sr=8-1/qid=1233359855/ref=noref?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1233359855&sr=8-1

The interior of the case is probably aluminum to draw heat from the drive. But, again, I don't trust passive cooling. Excellent design as far as looks go. I own three external drive cases: A Bytecc with a fan, another something brand that is all aluminum but no fan, and a 2.5 inch drive case for laptop drives with no fan. Guess which one I keep running. I use the other two for backups and such where the drive will not be running for long. Just my thoughts.
