1.1.1	I've been having this weird problem with my new ATI AGP video card, and now I am thinking it's caused by a conflict...	St
1.1.2	There are TWO Radeon drivers installing because Windows keeps detecting a secondary one on a PCI port!	St
1.1.3	I remove them every time, but they keep coming back.	St
1.2.1	I have Radeon Ati 9700 and it comes with driver installers and software combined CD.	St
1.2.2	The computer relies on windows drivers through the PCI until told otherwise.	St
1.2.3	It could be that either you have not installed Ati drivers properly, or whatever version of Ati is in conflict with windows.	St
1.2.4	What does 'roll back drivers' do if you have a version of XP?	St
1.3.1	Second....I also have ATI AIW 9700 Pro and in Device Mgr, it always shows two entries by default.	St
1.3.2	If you read through the install text (read me file) it will explain to you somewhere in it that this is normal.	St
1.3.3	So I would gather that your weird issue isn't related to that, and request that you describe what's happening.	St
1.3.4	TONI	St
