i had built my computer with a wd 640 black as my boot drive.
i decided i wanted to add a velociraptor 300 as my boot drive.
i had the 640 black partitioned in three even splits.
i added the vr300 and ran the acronis true image program and did the clone disk.
i let it do the auto thing and even though the &quot;c&quot; partition at 79gb on it and one partition had 121gb on it and one had only 5gb on it and this was less then 300gb.
so i did not think then it would matter that i was cloning a larger drive to a smaller drive.
it cloned it and then i went in and reformated the 121gb part as i did not need that data cloned, just the operating system.
now how do i get the system to boot off the new drive?
i still want to use the 640 black and so i will remove the op from it when i get this to work.
i tried just having only the new drive plugged in and got a ntrdl is missing.
so i plugged them all back in and it would not boot at all.
so i left the new one unplugged and it boots up like normal.
but if i plug the new one in now it won't boot and i get the same error.
at first it would not try and boot off the new one.
now if it is plugged in it tries and gets the error.
i can't even boot up to reformat the new drive.
what the heck have i done?
what should i do now?
