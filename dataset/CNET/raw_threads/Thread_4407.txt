I have an old Hp pavilion a730n desktop and I want to install windows 7 rc1 on it. now, when I ran the win7 upgrade advisor it told me to upgrade the graphics card (so I can enjoy the aero graphics! I was wondering what good but not expensive graphics card you recommend for my system? (preferably PCI Express x16 compatible, My MB has one) thnx in advance Overview of specs: CPU: Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHZ (800MHZ FSB) RAM: 2.50 GB of DDR1-400 SDRAM MotherBoard: ASUS PTGD1-LA If u need more details: here is the complete details of my system: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00233082#N307

(which is great!)would this card be compatible with my system? here is my system specs: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00233082 (except RAM = 2.50 GB)

Here's something newer that does not require a separate power source and is fanless ... translates into less noise. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102828 VAPCMD

I might actually get this one (I'll try waiting for free shipping). while taking a look at my pc's inner parts I found out that my power supply doesn't have a pci express power cord (weird given the fact that I have a pci e slot) anyway thnx a lot. VAPCMD, this card is the strongest candidate to buy so far....
9347	5	345609	3060021	3059973	howlin51	6/11/09 1:26 PM	1.24472676E12	just wondering	which nvidia card is comparable to the ati hd4350?
9347	6	345609	3060527	3060021	H-bound	6/12/09 11:00 AM	1.2448044E12	4350 vs. nVidia	A comparable nvidia card would be the 9400GT I'd go with this one http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121267 (more bang for the buck) XXXXXX T PS. I have an old 128meg 6600GT (similar performance as the 9400GT) in my old box (A64 3700+ SanDiego/1GBRAM) and get constant 60fps on Doom 3 @1280x1024/medium detail.
9347	7	345609	3060781	3060021	VAPCMD	6/12/09 8:22 PM	1.24483812E12	Many options ... nVidia and ATI...the better question is	what will be using the PC for ? VAPCMD

I'm actually gonna build a gaming rig later on (as soon as I can save enough $$$$$)so I'll probably be posting a lot of questions about that...
9347	9	345609	3060803	3060527	howlin51	6/12/09 9:19 PM	1.24484154E12	Another Strong Candidate	thnx for the taking the time to search for that deal.. I'll consider it. I have another question thou for anyone who knows. Will that PCIe x16 2.0 card work with a MB that only has PCIe x16?
9347	10	345609	3060979	3060803	H-bound	6/13/09 9:46 AM	1.24488636E12	No problem there	PCIe 2.0 is backwards compatible. I had my HD4830 card in the old box while I waited for my new MoBo to arrive (took almost a month around x-mas) XXXXXX T
