<s> Okay, I have an issue and am not sure how to resolve the problem. </s>
<s> Let's start off with a scenario. </s>
<s> Let's say I boot the computer with a DVD in the &quot;e-drive&quot; and open the 'My Computer'. </s>
<s> It will tell me what is in the drive. </s>
<s> When I eject the DVD from &quot;e:drive&quot; and replace it with a CD the 'My Computer' will not update the cd-drive. </s>
<s> The cd will also not do the auto-play (as do most cds that have an auto launch procedure). </s>
<s> The cd-drive under 'My Computer' will still show what was in the drive when the system was booted. </s>
<s> Even if I refresh the window it does nothing. </s>
<s> If I double click on the icon it will still act like it's a dvd and launch a dvd player instead of a music program or the application. </s>
<s> So far the only way to view the contents of the cd is to right click and explore. </s>
<s> This is currently occurring to both my cd-drives so I'm sure it may not be an issue with them but something else. </s>
<s> All the drivers are current and still cannot find the cause of the problem. </s>
<s> What could be causing this issue? </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP if that matters to anybody. </s>
<s> Any help could be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> If you need more info please ask. </s>

<s> First off..its best to say when I reach my DESKTOP..not so much that I BOOTUP and this or that.. .. </s>
<s> Since you are useing a DVD-ROM..you need to know the Media Types going in that TRAY..CDs don't matter..but I use a TOSHIBA(dash)Drive that if I place a DVD(plus)Disk in will corrupt my OS..and I have a second DVD-Drive that both(+ -)so all problems are eliminated.. .. Then it seems you said that you SHUT-Down with a disk in the TRAY..and then performed your START-UP w/the disk still in the TRAY..this can cause a problem or NOT..never SHUT Down with Removable Media in their Devices(especially)the FLOPPY Drive.. .. Also..are you RUNNING a Scheduled SCAN..and you have forgotten..so your attempting to run two programs at once..and that could be your problem.. .. </s>
<s> I also ARCHIVE my FILES/FOLDERS..this keeps my System Drive ready to RUN with little Power Management problems..I usually start with a empty PC..for each project..useing External HDDs.. .. </s>
<s> If none of the above is any help I would suggest you Re-Install and take a fresh look at your PC. </s>
