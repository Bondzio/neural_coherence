Thanks, Bill.
I think I'll be able to manage this, so to speak.
Getting the N router to be managed via the wan port is the only thing that worries me a little, but I assume I'll find this option somewhere.
And I'm pretty familiar with the DHCP table on my G router (I use it to see what all the devices I have connected are -- amazing how a little home network can grow until you have 10 or 12 things all attached).
Once again, I thank you for all the help and wish me luck (my fall back position is to return the N router and just run cable through the attic -- much simpler in practice but not nearly as versatile as I continue to add devices :&gt;)
