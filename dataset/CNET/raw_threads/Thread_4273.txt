5729	1	63269	751066	750696	Ray Harinec	2/9/05 5:24 AM	1.10792664E12	use slower memory cpu	simply run lower clock speed within reason simply check manual mobo lowest fsb support
5729	2	63269	751323	750696	Willy	2/9/05 7:24 AM	1.10793384E12	check manual specs	boils down good matching componets high end cpu expect high end ram order take advantage abilities present otherwise default works usually lower results enjoy willy
5729	3	63269	751768	751323	chuckieu	2/9/05 10:19 AM	1.10794434E12	reality	probably arent going difference between pc pc outside benchtest thats already ddr memory sort buy chuck
5729	4	63269	752268	750696	Ray Harinec	2/9/05 2:04 PM	1.10795784E12	forgot mention	moboschipsets allow fsb memory bus run asynchronously system processing slower maybe noticeably becase next clock arrives fs bus data avauble until next clock memory bus northbridge compensates introducing wait states states where memory process wait clock time frequently resulting slower speed overall
