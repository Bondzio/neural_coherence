Running win XP home SP1 on a new comp P4 2.8 . Everythin was working fine for the first 2 weeks. Then one day I go into my comp and (C:/ hardrive) (a 120Gb Seagate Sata drive) no longer has a little HD icon as it used to but rather that ugly little icon for unrecogised file types. When i try to click the drive to access it win XP tells me &quot;Please go to the control panel to install and configure system components&quot;. The drive is working apart from this little annoyance all programs on the disk run and all files can be read i just have to change to expanded view and click a subfolder on C:/ and things go fine. As long i dont try clicking on C:/ HD in explorer. Explorer is convinced i dont have a HD ! ! So i go into device manager the HD is there under disk drives and its 'properties' tab says device is working fine. I try uninstalling The hardware from device manager and reistalling. Windows detects and reinstall the HD correctly only the problem is still there ! ! Anyone know whats wrong, or how to fix it? I would be really grateful if you could tell me.

Did you build it yourself? did you install the Motherboard drives so the IDE/SATA controllers can be correctly configured? What does it show in device manager for the controllers?
