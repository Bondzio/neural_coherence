<s> I wanted to upgrade my WinXP home-built system with a new mobo and cpu. </s>
<s> But when it tries to start, it almost gets to the WinXP screen and then it restarts. </s>
<s> It keeps doing this over and over until I shut it down. </s>
<s> Someone told me that you can't use the same hard drive that was used in a WinXP system. </s>
<s> But all of the hardware except mobo and cpu are the same. </s>
<s> (sometimes I almost miss Win98)I have all of my software and documents there and I hate to wipe it and start over from scratch. </s>
<s> Can I set it as a slave in my upgraded system, or will this not work either? </s>
<s> The new mobo and cpu are just sitting in the box. </s>
<s> I had them checked out at a computer shop to make sure they were ok and they checked out fine. </s>
<s> I appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Yes, you can set it as a slave. </s>
<s> You also could put it on the other IDE channel (other cable) as a master or slave. </s>
<s> The current installation of XP on the old HD is expecting the old motherboard and its BIOS. </s>
<s> That causes major problems. </s>
<s> Boot to the XP CD and perform a repair installation of windows. </s>
<s> Hopefully you have a backup of your important files in cast there is a problem with the repair installation. </s>

<s> I will give it a try. </s>
<s> I will backup my files first then give it a try. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
