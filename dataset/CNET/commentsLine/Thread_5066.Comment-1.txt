okay, i have several questions and please read them carefully.
i did a system scan at  and they gave me listing of memories.
since that place do not accept bml payment method, i went to browse at a popular stores that accept bml payment method.
this is the only memory that i've found at the other stores that seem to match the one given at  please clear this up for me.
one of the recommended memories is this...  the other two stores also have this...   are the memory from these two stores the exact same as the one shown from crucial?
another question... why is tigerdirect selling it so much cheaper than newegg?
common sense to price this specific memory is about 65 to 75 buxs.
tigerdirect is selling the memory for 43 buxs.
i've sent emails to all three places and i'm still waiting on them to respond.
hopefully, someone can respond quicker on here.
is this a good, trusty brand - ballistix?
thanks!
thunder
