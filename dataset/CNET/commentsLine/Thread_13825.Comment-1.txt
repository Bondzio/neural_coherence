i use motorola vt1005, befsr41 on cable modem and vonage service.
currently i hook up as follows: cable modem - befsr41 (with 2 pcs) and- vt1005 problem is that the connection (voice) broken up when in use while browsing (no problem when no browsing) then i tried to configure port forwarding and port triggering on my befsr41 (as suggested many article) the ports that i forwarded: 5060-5063 --- udp - to vt1005 ip 69 ---------- udp - to vt1005 ip 123 --------- udp - to vt1005 ip 10000-20000 - udp - to vt1005 ip port triggering: triggered port forwarded start end start end 5060 5063 5060 5063 69 69 69 69 123 123 123 123 10000 20000 10000 20000 (i wonder if that how i supposed to do it) --- the problem remains..--- befsr41 - dhcp/nat enable, upnp disable.
vt1005 - dhcp/nat enable (i put a static ip manualy - port forwarding/triggering need) note: i don't want to place the vt1005, in front of the router, due to security on open port (vt1005 is known as bad router) and avoiding ping attack, etc.
are there any other thing i should/could do to eliminate the broken voice while browsing?
thank you for any help.
