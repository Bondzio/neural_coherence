i think samsung has an 8&quot; tablet coming out soon.
i want to buy a tablet but have been wavering between a 7&quot; for its compact size and 10&quot; because it would be easier to read.
i wouldn't be doing anything serious on it - maybe surfing and photos, solitaire, emails.
i have an ereader now i have to have the print on medium/large so 7&quot; might be hard to read (i'm a senior).
i'm wondering if anyone has used both a 7&quot; and 10&quot; and if they think an 8&quot; would be a good compromise.
thanks.
