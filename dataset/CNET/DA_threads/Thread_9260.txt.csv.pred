1.1.1	Hello everyone .	St
1.1.2	I do n't know much about internet/wireless setups , so I would really appreciate any help with my issue .	St
1.1.3	I recently moved to Japan where my internet provider ( Yahoo BB ADSL through Softbank ) makes me pay around $ 15 ( USD ) extra a month for the privilege of having a wireless connection .	St
1.1.4	The router they set my connection up with is not wireless , so they basically have me rent a wireless card ( I 'm not sure if that is the term ) which connects into the router from them .	St
1.1.5	I do n't know what the card is called or if I can purchase one myself so I can save the $ 15 extra a month .	St
1.1.6	Is there something else ( maybe a USB thing ) I can connect to the router to have a wireless signal ?	Ques
1.1.7	If I buy my own wireless router could I replace theirs with it and still have my internet work ?	Ques
