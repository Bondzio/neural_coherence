Good point.
That is what I most likely will do, try the HVR 1250 first but at least I have some idea of what processor upgrade I can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive.
The options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 GHz.
What is confusing is socket 939 vs what the AMD site lists sockets AM, AM2 and another one.
I wish terms were consistant across the board.
Thanks again for the advice.
I've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and I will read more.
