1.1.1	I am looking to buy this monitor .	St
1.1.2	Is it good ?	Ques
1.1.3	Do you recommend it ?	Ques
1.1.4	What is good/bad about it ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for the help !	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	See it in person .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	See if the out of warranty Gateway experience bothers you .	St
1.2.5	Read http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7596_102-0.html ? hhTest=1 & forumID=60 & threadID=96534 & start=0 for examples .	St
1.3.1	It is a o.k .	St
1.3.2	monitor .	St
1.3.3	The only reason people buy it is that it is one of the few 24 & quot ; computer monitors that has a 4 port hub and rca ( analog for game stations , vcr play back etc ... ) What hurts it is that the contrast ratio is only 1000 and has only a 1 year warranty .	St
1.3.4	Find a good Samsung or Lg 24 & quot ; and you will find a minimum of 3000 contrast ratio and a 3 year warranty .	St
1.3.5	You have to determine if the extra hook-ups are important to you .	St
1.3.6	The new HD 2401 does n't have the same hook-ups !	St
1.4.1	I own the monitor and I love it .	St
1.4.2	& quot ; e'cept it is not a 30 & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	The contrast ratio stated is 1000:1 - All I know is it is bright , ( I 'm running it at about 38 % and it is still very bright with very deep blacks ) .	St
1.4.4	It also has HDMI , DVI , VGA , Component , S-Video , & Composite inputs , along with Digital Sound output from the HDMI source ( for the optional sound bar ) , & the sound bar has Analogue and Digital audio Inputs .	St
1.4.5	The screen has a max of 1920 X 1200 Pixels per Inch w/ Faroudja video up-converting circuit , and 3ms response time .	St
1.4.6	It shows 1080P easy .	St
1.4.7	It pivots from landscape to portrait mode , and can rise up and down about 3 & quot ; .	St
1.4.8	You can power it on without turning on your computer , to watch a external source ( DVD Player , Video feed , camera feed ) .	St
1.4.9	I bought mine from HSN & gt ; $ 899.99 + tax/shipping , with a 1.6 Gb Pentium Dual-Core , 250 Gig HD , DVD Burner , Vista ... and it runs like a top !	St
1.4.10	They still have that same priced deal with a 320 Gig HD .	St
1.4.11	Gateway sells it by itself for $ 499.99 , but check the tax/shipping/insurance costs , cause when I ordered , if I had gotten it thru them it would have cost me $ 750.00 delivered & gt ; so the package was only $ 200.00 more WITH the computer .	St
1.4.12	In the stores , at the time , it was going for up to $ 799.99 by itself !	St
1.4.13	It has Beautiful color , and I 'm very happy with mine .	St
1.4.14	The only things it lacks is a built in SD/HD tuner , or a remote .	St
1.4.15	I 've 2 DVD Recorders w/ built-in tuners and remotes so that is not a problem .	St
1.4.16	Soon to get a HD Tuner w/HDMI .	St
1.4.17	This thing is a beauty ! ! !	St
1.4.18	And I do'nt work for or sell for Gateway .	St
