<s> when i bought my laptop from ibuypower, the instant it loaded up, it detected a wireless connection. </s>
<s> now, after i reinstalled windows since a gnarly crash, it will not even aknowledge the ability to detect wireless connections. </s>
<s> there is no . </s>
<s> the horrible service reps could only give me a site with drivers, but after installation, still no luck. </s>
<s> i also get this message when i try to install the driver for intel PRO/wireless network. </s>
<s> no matching driver has been found fot your adapter or no adapter is installed. </s>
<s> do you wish to proceed with this installation? </s>
<s> helppp </s>
<s> Given no model number and all the other details all I can write is that even GURUS have trouble installing Windows onto laptops. </s>
<s> The needed drivers for motherboard and then all the other parts can take hours and if you get one out of sequence it's been known to not work. </s>
<s> Service counters are overwhelmed with this issue and you can see why they can charge a few hundred to install Windows at times. </s>
<s> I see no details in your post so all I can write is make it a warranty issue. </s>

<s> I kinda had the same problem with my Sony Vaio VGN s150 (still got it). </s>
<s> When I brought it, the built in wireless worked great on my wireless network at home, I wanted to go with Windows Pro so I just reinstalled and what do you know the wireless stopped working. </s>
<s> Even with me downloading all the drivers I could off of the Sony site, nothing would work. </s>
<s> I reinstalled Windows three times on it before I just gave up and kept it. </s>
<s> One thing that did help a little when the wireless wasn't working was to install SP2. </s>
<s> That helped my laptop see the router but for some reason still couldn't connect. </s>
<s> So I just went the way I knew would work, so I just brought me a wireless network adapter and it's been great ever since. </s>
<s> For some reason Windows just wouldn't handle my wireless correctly anymore after that reinstall. </s>
<s> After all of that, it sounds like you just brought it so yeah like Bob said warranty. </s>
