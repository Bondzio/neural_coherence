My previous system used Intel processor. Is this AMD processor as reliable as the Intel Processor? I understand that the one major difference between the AMD and Intel is price. There is also some chatter alluding to the fact that the AMD 64 is prone to hardlocks. Does anyone have the facts on these issues?

The office has more than a handful Athlon 64s and no more lockups than any other (Intel) desktops. Can you craft a test that I could run to measure this one? Bob PS.

I bought an Athlon 800Mhz chip in 2000 when I upgraded from my Intel Pentium II. In 2002, I bought the Athlon 1.7Ghz chip that my desktop currently runs. I was experiencing a lot of lockups on both chips for a while there, but those turned out to be Windows ME related as the problems went away when I upgraded to Windows XP. My wife's laptop runs an AMD Sempron 2.8 or 3.0 Ghz processor. One of the reasons that I switched to AMD, besides price, is that AMD had hired an engineer from Digital Equipment Corp. (bought by Compaq which was bought by HP). DEC was known for their 200Mhz bus and 64 bit processors while Intel was getting to 32 bit. I figured with a DEC engineer running the show, the Athlon chip might have some of their fine engineering behind it. I have never been disappointed.

Any lockups you may experience will be due to your OS install and any programs that have been installed. I've built many AMD powered systems for family and friends and relucktantly built two Intel systems and those systems cost way more than any AMD system. Do yourself a favor and build your own system. There are many resources on the web (anandtech.com) and many reputable vendors (NewEgg.com) Its quite rewarding. Many store systems try to wow you with lots of additional software you'll never use.
5243	8	133231	1515629	1502418	jsmumma	11/4/05 3:48 AM	1.13107608E12	My experience with AMD CPUs	I purchased a desktop system assembled locally in early 1999 that had an AMD K6-2 running at 300 MHz. The system was used heavily by two high school students, by my wife (a teacher), and by me (an engineer). It was also used to run various Linux distributions (Red Hat, Suse, Caldera) in dual-boot (LILO) configurations with Windows. Today it is running Windows XP Home Edition SP2 that was an upgrade from the original Windows 98 (not SE). It is used almost entirely for word processing with Microsoft Works 4.5 by my wife. It is left on all the time to save startup time and because it has an attached laser printer that can be accessed over our home network from other systems. Around August 1999 my college-bound daughter purchased a Compaq Presario 1237 laptop (from Radio Shack) that had an AMD K6 266 MHz MMX(tm) enhanced processor. This was more than adequate for her purposes at college. The lower CPU cost offset the higher cost of the far superior (to HPA) active-matrix TFT display and three-spindle (hard drive, CD-ROM drive, and floppy drive) configuration. The system came with Windows 98. It was connected to the college's network using Novell drivers and a 3COM PCMCIA NIC. She still has it and it still works. In October 2001 I took the plunge and bought myself an HP Pavilion N5425 notebook computer. It has a 900-MHz AMD Athlon. This has been my main computer for the past four years. It came with Windows XP Home Edition and has been upgraded to SP2. I run all sorts of applications on it: Microsoft Office XP (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook), Visio, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Borland C++ Builder 5 (C/C++ software development), Scilab, Winamp, iTunes, Musicmatch Jukebox, Windows Media Player 10, RealPlayer, DivX Player, TextPad, Source Edit, Snag-It, TurboTax, Norton Ghost 9.0, Norton Internet Security (AntiVirus, Personal Firewall), Norton AntiSpam, Webroot Spy Sweeper, Java VM, STEEM (Atari ST Emulator), Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0.5, N4PY control software for my Ten-Tec Argonaut V amateur radio transceiver, DigiPan PSK31 software, and all manner of tools and utilities (some written by me). It all works. The only problems I have had with this HP notebook PC are related to progressive failure of the cable between the display and the rest of the system, which leads me to the next AMD-based computer. I recently ordered an HP Pavilion zv6000 series notebook with AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (2.0 GHz) CPU. When this arrives, it will become my main computer. My old HP notebook will then go in for surgery (under my soldering iron) to see if I can get the diplay running again. However, even if I can't, I can still use it with an external monitor, as I am doing right now! (Prior to this bump in the road, I was using the internal display as &quot;1&quot; and the external display as &quot;2&quot; in a dual-monitor extended desktop arrangement.) Based upon my experience (both past and anticipated future), you should be OK with AMD CPUs, at least in terms of system availability. And remember, reliability (MTBF) is only one component of availability, which is what we users really care about. The other major component is repair time (MTTR), which is probably the more significant of the two. Overall, I have had good experiences with HP products over the years. Also, when HP uses AMD processors they know that they are staking THEIR reputation on that decision.

Find a tech savvy friend to explain the numbers to you. An intel chip at 3 ghz is running at 3 ghz to get that performance. An AMD chip rated at 3 ghz performance is actually running around 2.4 ghz. This means it is not working as hard to do the same work as an intel chip. It also means it lasts longer due to less heat being made. If you check over some of the old articles you can find on the net comparing intel chips and AMD chips, you'll find that in almost every case the intel lags the AMD in the tests made for performance. I've been working on systems for friends and family for about 15 years now....I'll not buy or recommend intel ever.

My reccomendation would be a San Diego/Venice core (newest Socket 939 core). Unless your a hardcore gamer, then get an Athlon64 X2 When building gamer machines, AMD's SPANK Intel. You have a bigger selection of chipsets, until recently the nVidia nForce chipsets were only available for AMD. Now nVidia makes an nForce4 chipset for Intel but it is alot slower than the AMD counterpart. I have been using AMD for a long time. Ever since they bought NexGen. Best chips on the market. Intel is hyped, slower, and more expensive. I don't know about you, but faster and cheaper (with the same amount of stability) sounds better to me.

You need to learn to separate the quality of the machine built from the specific components inside the machine. I've built a multitude of machines. The last 3 AMD. I will never pay Intel's premium again.

Also the 64 bit processors are more futuristic than the 32 bit processors, therefore you want to have the AMD 64 processors because it is the new wave of technology. And finally the HP computers offer you the best in after sales support as well as extra software such as imagezone and hardware such as lightscribe, that other brands do not offer, for free. Thus the HP AMD athlon 64 is a wise choice.

You should try upgrading to a processor with HT or the more recent Dual Core technology. Or you could simply instruct your staff not to run more than a few applications at a time.

Ever since then I've stuck with AMD, so mych so that I even managed to get the operating characteristics of different typses of chips, so at least I can look them over BEFORE I buy them. I have already had a look at the operating specs of Intel and others vs AMD, and have decided that on the present specs, the next chip will definitely be AMD 64bit, probably the AMD64 X2 dual core model.

IE A 286 chip will always give 286 even today yonks after it first came out. But an AMD will over time give less and less of it's original powere output. And an AMD chip gives out twice as much heat as an Intel chip. So that means exta fans, and heatsink. Meaning more power consumtion for your already power hungry PC!

Buy from good dealer and get a good heatsink fan. You won't regret it. Although some cases say they only work with pentium (Lian Li). So, check out your case, too.

I've seen ups, and downs to both sides. I've also seen people buy the wrong type of processor for them. As far as reliability, AMD and Intel are for the most part, the same. Expect years of service from both. However, DON'T run out buying a 64-bit Athlon because somebody told you to. First off, AMD's seem to fit better into the gaming slot. Most geeks delight in a faster processor, cheaper. Intel seems to lag in the gaming market. Now, that doesn't mean that you should ONLY consider an AMD. If you want to run buisness apps, I suggest getting an Intel. My personal experiance is that Intel is better suited towards the high end buisness apps. If you just want the basics (like Microsoft Word, internet, printing information for personal or professional use) I suggest going with the AMD Duron or Intel Celeron, simply because, in general, they have lower price tags. Though keep in mind.. if speed is important... an AMD Duron was SUPPOSED to be an AMD Athlon... but it failed its testing. By the same token... an Intel Celeron was SUPPOSED to be an Intel Pentium... but it too failed its tests. (Thats a nasty little secret, isn't it?) Personally, I prefer the Intel Celeron in this case. Not quite as peppy as the Duron, but it seems to do a little bit better on the basics like Microsoft Word (from what I have seen). Ok, now that you've made your decision between a gaming rig, or a buisness machine.... and if you want just the basics, or something with a little more 'umph', you now need to know WHICH of AMD or Intel is right for you (the hardest part is now over). Your selection will be limited, as it seems the Duron is no longer listed by AMD as a current processor (expect a Duron machine to be next to nothing... if you can still find one). If you have decided that you can take a slight hit in speed, and you would like to keep that wallet at fat as possible, you don't need this next part, as a Celeron or Duron (if you can still find one...) would be just fine for you. Now... we hit what type. Right now, the 64-bit series isn't too useful, since most apps don't take advantage of the 64-bit structure. Expect that to change within a year or so, Especially with the release of the next version of Windows, Windows Vista. If you want a long term, higher performance AMD, go with the 64-bit AMD that you are looking at. If this is just a short fix (less than 16 months), stick with and AMD Athlon. If the Intel series fits you best (as mentioned earlier...), and you need a long term machine, go for a Dual-Core system. That is, if you can find it, and more important, afford it. If you can't find it, or afford it, stick with an Intel Pentium 4. Though the Pentium 4 was knocked out of Intel's line-up just a couple of months ago, you might be able to have the last laugh by getting a left over Pentium 4 system. Don't fret. The Pentium 4 still packs quite a punch, in the buisness apps section. Well, I hope that this helps. More important, I hope that I havn't given you mental indigestion. If you still need more help, just let us know!

I have built around 20 computers for myself, my family and many friends. I have never built an Intel box simply because of the added cost for comparable performance. Around 2 1/2 years ago my brother (who works for Intel) gave me a new Intel processor... They get them free every year or so, and he had no need to upgrade his computer at the time. It was a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 533. I bought an Asus P4B533 motherboard for the thing, along with a good heatsink/fan and 2 gigs of DDR memory for it, since my current machine was using slower DDR... I chose Asus because I have had the best luck with them... Flawless performance from every motherboard made by them... Since the processor was free, I spared no expense on any of the other components... To make a long story short, that computer was the biggest piece of crap I have ever built! I have never had so many problems, even using ECS (EliteGroup Computer Systems) motherboards that I got on sale with processors at Fry's for dirt cheap... Problem after problem... Blue Screen of Death, lockups, the system hanging for periods of several minutes... My favorite was the fact that about evry tenth boot up the motherboard would announce &quot;System Failed due to CPU Overclocking&quot; and go into the bios setup, which my wife and kids had no clue how to deal with... If I needed to restart the computer, the only way it would do it was to shut down and wait for several minutes before restarting, otherwise it would ALWAYS fail to boot due to the CPU overclocking error... I had a high dollar solid copper heatsink, and used the best Arctic Silver heatsink compound... Asus had a utility to monitor temperature, and the CPU was not running hot according to the AsusProbe... I have never overclocked a computer, since I always have reliability and stability as my highest priorities... If I need more performance, I tend to buy a higher performance processor rather than tweak a processor to run faster than it is designed to... I dealt with this for more than a year, and finally got pissed off... Nothing would make this computer run reliably... I was constantly trying to get it set up so that it would be reliable; absolutely nothing worked... I finally decided to trash it and go back to AMD... I bought an Athlon 64 3500+ fairly soon after they first came out, and an Asus A8V Deluxe motherboard... It was more than I usually spend on an upgrade, but I was tired of messing with my computer... That computer has been completely bullet proof... Not one problem, ever. It has been running flawlessly, day in and day out... Hardlock? What's that? At work I have a P4 3.2 GHz Dell Optiplex GX-280 system, and the AMD is significantly faster... I use SDRC I-Deas, Solidworks, Pro Engineer and Ansys on both machines, and the AMD is very noticeably faster... (I am using 73GB 10,000 RPM Ultra-160 Fujitsu SCSI drives and Adaptec 29160 controllers in both machines... I have my own personal hard drives in my machine at work, so they are exactly the same as far as storage performance) They are both very reliable, but the AMD is better... The Dell has locked up running really large simulations a couple of times... I have taken my work home several times to finish there, and I have never had a problem. It's tough to beat absolutely flawless reliability! Buy the AMD with total confidence!

I cannot think of any other difference except for gaming. I use my AMD for gaming and I have two other computers with an Intel and an AMD respectively. The 64 bit is over rated right now since there are not any programs built to take advantage of the processor.

I've stuck exclusively to AMD processors and have been thrilled with them. Not one has ever been defective. You probably don't remember the several &quot;scandals&quot; with defectively-designed Intel processors -- but essentially AMD processors have a clean slate when it comes to reliability and no defects while Intel has been problematic for years. AMD has also taken the technology lead. The real disaster you are courting is getting a computer made by HP (and that includes Compaq). HP has a nasty tendency to cut corners and remove features from the motherboards it uses in its computers. And it's tech support is the bottom of the barrel. For example, when a friend had me help him update the BIOS on his HP computer, we followed the somewhat strange instructions on HP's website for installing the BIOS update. Following their instructions corrupted the CMOS. Normally this is easily solved by resetting a jumper on the motherboard. But to save a few cents in manufacturing, HP did not include the pins and jumper for clearing the CMOS. After an hour of talking to a very nasty person at HP tech support, she finally admitted that the instructions on HP's website had been wrong for at least 3 months, but it wasn't tech support's responsibility to get it corrected. They had to send my friend a new computer. And just this month it was revealed that HP's notebooks that use the AMD64 processor were being built with the Dual Channel RAM disabled. HP spokesmen said that they did this because they couldn't trust consumers who wished to add more RAM to get the right RAM modules. Now many folks know that AMD64 processors and their motherboards all support Dual Channel RAM (which runs much faster than single channel). But nowhere does HP tell perspective customers that Dual Channel RAM is disabled on these notebooks. The only HP products I've even owned that worked well and lasted have been their overpriced laser printers. My 8-year old LaserJet 4000 is, unfortunately, on its last legs, and I know darned well that it will not be replaced with an HP printer. Bottom line: Friends don't let friends buy HP. Better to buy from Gateway, IBuyPower.com (where you can configure your computer piece by piece -- go for the Asus motherboards since they can also use the AMD Dual Core CPUs which will be affordable in a year or two), MonarchComputer.com, or have one made for you locally.

You probably don't remember the several &quot;scandals&quot; with defectively-designed Intel processors -- but essentially AMD processors have a clean slate when it comes to reliability and no defects while Intel has been problematic for years. AMD has also taken the technology lead. The real disaster you are courting is getting a computer made by HP (and that includes Compaq). HP has a nasty tendency to cut corners and remove features from the motherboards it uses in its computers. And it's tech support is the bottom of the barrel. For example, when a friend had me help him update the BIOS on his HP computer, we followed the somewhat strange instructions on HP's website for installing the BIOS update. Following their instructions corrupted the CMOS. Normally this is easily solved by resetting a jumper on the motherboard. But to save a few cents in manufacturing, HP did not include the pins and jumper for clearing the CMOS. After an hour of talking to a very nasty person at HP tech support, she finally admitted that the instructions on HP's website had been wrong for at least 3 months, but it wasn't tech support's responsibility to get it corrected. They had to send my friend a new computer. And just this month it was revealed that HP's notebooks that use the AMD64 processor were being built with the Dual Channel RAM disabled. HP spokesmen said that they did this because they couldn't trust consumers who wished to add more RAM to get the right RAM modules. Now many folks know that AMD64 processors and their motherboards all support Dual Channel RAM (which runs much faster than single channel). But nowhere does HP tell perspective customers that Dual Channel RAM is disabled on these notebooks. The only HP products I've even owned that worked well and lasted have been their overpriced laser printers. My 8-year old LaserJet 4000 is, unfortunately, on its last legs, and I know darned well that it will not be replaced with an HP printer. Bottom line: Friends don't let friends buy HP. Better to buy from Gateway, IBuyPower.com (where you can configure your computer piece by piece -- go for the Asus motherboards since they can also use the AMD Dual Core CPUs which will be affordable in a year or two), MonarchComputer.com, or have one made for you locally.

HP has disabled this capability on its notebooks because, according to its spokesperson, HP does not think consumers who wish to upgrade their RAM are capable of buying RAM that matches (which is crucial for dual channel memory). SO if you were counting on that feature, you might want to reconsider HP. A pretty good alternative is the Gateway MX7515 notebook with 15&quot; widescreen, AMD64 4000+ CPU, 1 GB RAM, 100 GB hard drive, DVD RW drive, ATI Radeon Mobility X660 video, Windows XP Home (a downside) etc. which Best Buy has been selling for as little as $1199. Not only does it have a real manual, but the two times I had to call tech support with really technical questions, a live person anwsered within 25 seconds.

Windows XP 64 is available as well as 64 versions of linux (I think Windows 2003 Server has a 64 bit version too). Try running 64-bit versions of Debian with access to archives of software converted over to 64 bit (64-bit Firefox for exampl). They are out there. You just need to look.

I am writing this on an AMD 64-bit computer that I built myself that has been running a data conversion script for the past 23 HOURS and 46 minutes at 100% CPU usage and still has enough power for me to write this and read email and everything. This computer has NEVER crashed in the nearly a year since I built it. If that's not reliable, I don't know what is. Also, HP computers based on AMDs work much better than their Intel counterparts. I have a client who has a bunch of HP machines, and the one with the AMD CPU has held up much longer than the others. When they needed new machines, I built them 4 computers with AMD Semprons and after a year, not a single one of those computers has ever crashed (and I am using one as their corporate server). Go ahead and buy that HP, assuming its one of the nice new white ones. I recommended one to a client (a 3500 cpu) and he is completely satisfied with it. The computer salespeople say that is the one that all of the IT people recommend to their customers if they don't want to build one themselves.

HP bad	there are several posts here stating that HP &quot;Puts thier reputation on the line&quot; when refering to AMD processors. Reputation? If they wanted to save thier reputation, they should have stayed out of the PC market. HP/Compaq Computers are bad news. I used to work for a electronics store (the one with the R logo ;)) about half of the HP/Compaqs we sold came back with hardware problems. AMD makes a wonderfull Processor line. My first PC was an AMD 286. ive worked with and owned PC with every AMD family line processor up to the A64. ive only seen a couple of minor things with them that usually turned out to be a hardware compatibility issue with something else in the PC. Gateway Still builds AMD machines, (eMachines does too) Any local builder would reccomend AMD for the Cost factor.

The only thing I've heard on the &quot;grapevine&quot; is that AMD's tend to heat up (an issue that by now may have been fixed; but I'm not sure). To counter that, I just removed my side panel all together to allow air in and out more freely (not recommended if your PC is within reach or kids, coffee or pets) and I make sure to dust it out every 2 months or so. All in all, you will not be disappointed going with AMD. Good luck! regards, Dave

I used processors from Intels 8086 to their 80486 without problems. I switched to AMD back in the K5 days due to better pricing. I currently use an Athlon XP which has served its purpose well. Today's Nforce and Via chipsets have eliminated stability issues and offer great performance when compaired to Intel systems. I will be looking at an Athlon 64 when it is time to upgrade because of past reliability.

That is the only thing I've had to do to mine! A very reliably machine it has been! In fact, all I used to hear about the AMD, besides being a much more inexpensive way to go, is that compared to intel, both being equal, the AMD being much more faster than the intel.Also reliable. So going w/AMD, as far as I'm concerned, is the best way to go! You shouldn't be disappointed at all!

I have a HP desktop with a 2.8Ghz P5-HT and a HP notebook with a 3200(2Ghz) Athlon 64. For crunching video stuff, it is faster on the Athlon than my P5. I haven't had any problems with locks on the Athlon. It actually runs cooler and faster than my other Dell notebook with an Intel Centrino chip.

It all matters on what u want.

The 754 sempron series is cheap, fast and cool making it a great overclocker. The Athlon 64 is a great processor especially for gamers as it beats intel p4 all around and runs a couple of degrees cooler. The turion is again faster that the intel centrino. The athlon x2 in which i'm planning to get in the future beats intels 840 hands down, cooler faster and cheaper. The athlon 64 has enhanced virus protection with windows xp sp2 installed.

Both Intel and AMD processor are very good that you can't really tell which processor is better than the other. Seems you never have a machine with AMD processor before, why not give it a try with AMD? Then, you will be able to have the experience and better understanding with AMD processor. If you want to get a very good performance system with low price, then I'll suggest you to get a AMD Athlon X2 3800+ or AMD Athlon 64 3200+ if you just want to use it to do office document and online.

I have owned PCs that have had cyrix, intel celeron & pentium 4 cpus that have all locked up but my amd athlon64 has yet to crash although I admit I've only been using it since tuesday. I've bought 4 intel PC's before and decided its time for an amd one having heard that amds are supposed to be more stable. Last year I was desparate for a pc so I got a pentium 4 3gz before intel made them with the 3 number designation and not only have I had numerous lock-ups/crashes but the very first time I switched it on I couldnt believe how noisey the cooling fan was and I nearly took it back then and I wish I had now. It was so loud that even my flatmate could hear it down the hall with his door closed and I always thought it sounded like a loud dying chicken! Then shortly after I got a HP with amd athlon 64 3400 hoping to return my pentium 4 pc but I left it too late so I've only just started using my amd HP but the very first thing I noticed is how virtually silent it really is and its cooler too so that for me is another major bonus in addition to the lower cost, equal if not better performance and running at lower clock speed means less heat, noise and power consumption so amd really deserves to overtake intel in the processor war which I'm not sure if they're winning right now. I dont think I will ever go back to WINTEL processors ever again so take the plunge like me and be delighted!

I have AMD also and it has ran perfectly for 7 years now, but niether my or your statement matters really since that was 32 bit not 64 like the person is asking. The 64 did have lock up issues or something along that line but was supposed to have a fix for it. I think it had something to do with 32 bit apps not running properly more than a lockup of the cpu.

It ran the 386 processor. Since then, I have run a half-dozen AMD processors in various motherboards, including my present Athlon 2400+ with NO problems related to the CPU. Various PC's from my employers have run Intel CPU's, and I see no advantage to using the more expensive Intel chips.

BTW, if performance is a major point of consideration, don't get a brand name, the oem parts aren't as good as retail and often have features disabled or missing. Dual Channel Memory is a prime example of this.

The PROCESSOR has never caused problems, but the operating system has (in all three AMDs I have). I started with a 586 which I put together way back when and progressed to an Athlon 900 which this machine is. My Athlon XP machine runnind WinXP Pro is causing problems because of the operating system and not the processor. I only look at and buy AMD products. Guess you could say that I am a fan of AMD.

We can all give you enough facts and figures to keep yeading for a year but, suffice it to say that AMD has given the best bang for the buck for many many years now. My company actually handles wholesale distribution of both Intel and AMD so I am speaking from many years of experience in the industry.

Since then i've been a loyal AMD customer and always will be. the AMD ran Win98 with 128 MB sdram with an ASUS mboard the Intel ran Win98 with 256 MB sdram I recommend buying either a custom built AMD based computer, an Alienware, or Falcon-Northwest computer. I've never met anyone that has had a problem with either of these companies.

An thlon 64 and X2 run onne hell of alot cooler allowing it to overclock more, hence being more stable(before overclock). They normally run a couple of degrees cooler. This is because the intel's cpu are clocked much higher. Plus AMd doesn't have a stupid cpu slot compared to intel's lga 775, in which you need a screwdriver and push with all your might, therefore you will be worrying about damaging your motherboard rather than fitting the cpu in. When installing an athlon 64, you just slot the cpu in and push down on th mechanism. The best thing about it is that that Athlon 64's have the best frame rates when it comes to gaming e.g. Athlon Fx-57. And they were first to develop 64 bit processors therefore it s future proof! The future proof socket 939 allows you to upgrade you current single core 64 to a dual core x2 by flashing the bios! e.g. Athlon x2 4800: clock speed: 2.4Ghz per core power required:110w Intel 840 clock speed: 3.2Ghz per ( low compasred to normal p4 due to heat restrictions!) power required: 130w Checkout the latest benchmarking results online or a mag andyou will be amazed as AMDs only suffer when it comes to encoding but excel at other tasks especially gaming.

AMD kept copying Intel architecture that there was a time that they went to court that ordered Intel to release the 486 microcodes. After this episode, AMD started developing their own architecture. AMD's platform architecture is very different from that of Intel's. AMD connect directly to the memory and its chipsets but the chipset has no direct connection to the memory. This means that the processor has to work hard passing info from the memory to chipset and vice versa(aka multi i/o task). But with the processor's direct connection with the memory, it could finish a memory task much faster. Intel's way is processor to chipset to memory. There is no direct connection to the memory meaning the chipset has to channel a lot of info between the processor and memory. Chipsets are designed for that job (aka multi i/o task) therefore if could finish the multi i/o much faster, like memory caching, etc. From an engineering stand point, both processors are good since they perform as adverstised, both uses nanometer technology meaning an error in the number of molecules per area means the difference between a functioning product and non-functioning one. For enthusiast who build their own &quot;tower&quot; or desktop, the system that you built might have a problem but you can't blame it on the processor. Your &quot;tower&quot; consist of many different parts that have been bought from different suppliers. These parts generally work together but they have different tolerances. You might have build two towers with identical parts but one would hung-up while the other works just fine. This is the same with any branded PCs. One might work fine but another may experience problem. I've worked for one of the two. I've even worked for DEC where we have the Alpha, the first true 64 bit proc. But I woundn't say &quot;Intel sucks&quot; or &quot;AMD sucks&quot;. One can never generalized. These are marks of uninformed enthusiast. I would rather go to their websites www.intel.com or www.amd.com and read up about the processors. It make for interesting reading.

As a student in Computer Sciences, I built my first computer from scratch using an AMD Athlon 1.2 GHZ Processor, back on 2001. That was a great experience and as of today, that PC still running smoothly. I have never experienced any harware failure related or linked to the processor itself. I have used that machine as a test machine and I tried many crazy things with it. Currently I am using a Media Center PC from HP with an Athlon 64 3500 in it and believe me, I am very happy. One more thing is that in the 64 bits race, AMD has some advance against Intel and this is recognized by many analysts. My advice is do not hezitate. Go ahead, get your AMD 64 3700 PC and in the meantime you will get yourself ready for the future upgrade to Windows Vista. Enjoy!

Plus most of AMDs chips are 64 bit ready, while Intel makes us think that we have to pay more to get more. They have 64 bit ready chips in I believe 3 of their series. Their dual core 800 series, their 600 series, and I believe their dual core D series, but not sure on that last one.

Microsoft designs their software for Intel processors. AMD is always playing catch-up. Did you notice that XP Media Center came out on all Intel chips and it took forever for it to finally to be released on a computer with and AMD chip.

Ever since AMD came out with the first 64 bit ready chip back in 2003, it has been downhill for Intel. AMD currently has the fastest dual core CPU (AMD X2 4800+), the fastest single core CPU (AMD Athlon 64 FX-57), and generally have better value and better chips all around. Think about it, you can get a 64 bit ready processor from AMD in almost every processor AMD sells, but with Intel it is in about I believe 3 of there series, their dual core 800 series, their 600 series, and I believe the dual core D series. Intel even ditched the BTX form factor design only to go back to ATX. Face it, the future is AMD.

From an old AMD K6 to my current AMD 64 - all have run fine. The only lockups I have ever had have been due to running Windows software back in the days of Windows 95, 98, ME and 2000. Since I have moved along to XP I have few problems and no more 'blue screen of death.' I was tempted to drop them all and move to Apple's Mac machines until XP came out. I must admit no real problems with my Pentiums, but for the money I seem to get a whole lot more from myu AMD's.

They only have hype because they hired more advertisers than developers. Never ever buy Intel. I hope the CEO of intel is reading this from his crappy celeron PC. What am I saying? I'm sure even he isn't dumb enough to own one of his worthless products. He knows exactly how worthless they are. Might as well stick a quarter under your heatsink rather than an intel chip. Then again, the quarter is good for 15 minutes of parking. Wonder if I can try sticking an intel card in a parking meter? hmmm? Ok. Intel cards are worth 25 cents.

That Intel a good processor was over rated and overpriced. Maybe now we may see a bit more balance in the use of amd.
5243	82	133231	1582094	1522325	tech_suck	12/5/05 4:45 PM	1.1338011E12	do more research please	amd made flash and contract manufacturer for intel. because x86 license agreement, intel wants to break away x86 platform. sorry Intel x86 base is so huge. K6 is a Nexgen. IBM was a contract manufacturer for Nexgen. too bad IBM could not make chip fast enough. if IBM did it could be NexGen Versus Intel today. Athlon is just an Alpha. Intel fail to stop Amd from accessing Alpha technology. I don't see any major &quot;innovation&quot; from Amd. It's just a copy cat (like Microsoft).

RE: &quot;I'll never pay Intel's price premium again...&quot; Ha, AMD was surely the price performance leader, and even the performance champ for a while there. But, since then, sometimes Intel has been the price/performance leader once again. And, they've won back the king of the hill top performance spot too. I hope AMD has something in the works to kick Intel in the pants again, but, maybe that's wishful thinking? It's not &quot;hammer time&quot; anymore
