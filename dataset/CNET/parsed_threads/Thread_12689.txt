<s> I have two computers, both with wireless adapters, a 11mbps Linksys, and a 54mbps D-Link. </s>
<s> It seems that they will not function very well when both of them are in operation, with frequent signal drops. </s>
<s> When I use only one of them, there are no problems. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> To sort it out, I had to update firmware and drivers all around. </s>
<s> Have you? </s>
<s> I didn't think of updating firmware at all, gonna go check now </s>
<s> I'm writing about the firmware in the router. </s>
<s> -&gt; When posting, name names, makes, models, versions so others can chime in about such. </s>
<s> You may be shortchanging yourself of someone that's been there with your make/models/versions. </s>
