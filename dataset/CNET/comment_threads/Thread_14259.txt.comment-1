Hi, My girlfriend has a garage apartment about 35 yards outside the house.
She has a wireless modem, with Time Warner Roadrunner, as a wireless network in about a 3000 square foot house.
I can find out what specific modem she has if need be.
What would we need to get the wireless internet out to the apartment?
I want to setup some computers and she also wants to be able to offer internet to her prospective tenants.
Thanks for you help!
