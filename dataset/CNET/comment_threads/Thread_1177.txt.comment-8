Those cordless phones are not the same thing with differences I decline to list since I would have to write quite a few paragraphs.
I'm an electronics designer with designs in two way paging systems so to express why would result in many paragraphs.

For me yes.
For others?
Maybe.
If you used routers that could be configured as a WAP or WAPs or that you could install OpenWRT that supports turning such into a WAP but then I would be repeating what I wrote above... Bob
