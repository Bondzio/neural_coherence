<s> I went to Fry's Electronics today and bought a Gateway FX6801-01 Desktop computer. </s>
<s> I got it home and it would not boot up. </s>
<s> I took it back to Fry's and they opened it up and looked inside. </s>
<s> This is what that found. </s>
<s> NO CPU! </s>
<s> and the 9 megs of memory had been exchanged for 3 megs of memory. </s>
<s> Fry's would not exchange it. </s>
<s> ARRRGGHH! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Was this an open box unit? </s>
<s> There's little I can offer here (nothing really) except to make sure you leave the store with what you think you bought. </s>
<s> If you want to do this right, call the police department to arrange to make a report of the theft so you get it all done (just the facts, man) on a police report. </s>
<s> Then off to small claims court. </s>

<s> It was a unopened box with the Gateway tape still on it. </s>
<s> I am thinking someone at Gateway is yanking CPU's and Memory. </s>
<s> You can't know who did it but the path to setting it right is not to post about it all over the internet (unless that's just to vent.) </s>
<s> This is a simple issue of theft. </s>
<s> If the store won't take the return then it's again a simple issue of theft and you make the police report and proceed to small claims. </s>
<s> A lot of trouble but I hope that your goals are to get what you paid for. </s>
<s> Sometimes I find folk just want to rant. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Its now on your shoulders to proceed with a police report as already mentioned. </s>
<s> To contact the PR person or management and register a complaint at Fry's. </s>
<s> Send a registered letter with a copy of police report to main/corp. </s>
<s> office of Fry's. </s>
<s> You mean business and this not something you did but outside of your hands. </s>
<s> If no response or ineffective then proceed to small claims court, with all your *PAPERWORK* and hope for the best. </s>
<s> You can contact Gateway also, to see if they can resolve the matter. </s>
<s> If Gateway send units out with possible h/w lacking or its part of a pattern that they may have arrived at. </s>
<s> Again, send copies of your police report and show your in earnest to resolve this. </s>
<s> Of course, if this was paid for by CC, deny any funds be released as again enter this in writing and foward police copies, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Call NOW, not tomorrow to get it taken off. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
