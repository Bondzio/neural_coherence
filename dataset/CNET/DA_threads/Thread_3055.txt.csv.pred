1.1.1	I 've got 2 questions : 1 .	St
1.1.2	What 's better for making the PC softwares ( not games ) run faster and making the PC stuck less ?	Ques
1.1.3	Increasing the RAM from 256 to 512 OR upgrading the processor [ details in here - http : //tinyurl.com/4ww3l ] to a new one ?	Ques
1.1.4	( let 's say- P3 933MHz ? )	Ques
1.1.5	2 .	St
1.1.6	I want to add a fan to my PC 's case , but when I connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically , and it wo n't stop .	St
1.1.7	What can be the problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	What 's better for making the PC softwares ( not games ) run faster and making the PC stuck less ?	Ques
1.2.3	Increasing the RAM from 256 to 512 OR upgrading the processor [ details in here - http : //tinyurl.com/4ww3l ] to a new one ?	Ques
1.2.4	( let 's say- P3 933MHz ? )	Ques
1.2.5	This is not possible .	St
1.2.6	Here 's why .	St
1.2.7	I 'll use the game DOOM 3 as my example that no system today can play that game at it 's top settings without & quot ; stuck & quot ; or a pause now and then .	St
1.2.8	The game was designed to push the envelope and to take advantage of hardware yet to be .	St
1.2.9	2 .	St
1.2.10	I want to add a fan to my PC 's case , but when I connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically , and it wo n't stop .	St
1.2.11	What can be the problem ?	Ques
1.2.12	I 'd say the cause can be either a poor installation or a power supply that is on the edges of the maximum that it can supply .	St
1.2.13	Bob	St
1.3.1	1 .	St
1.3.2	I do n't play games in my PC .	St
1.3.3	I want to make my PC more stable and that I 'll be able to run programs in the background with a smaller chance that the PC would stuck .	St
1.3.4	2 .	St
1.3.5	Should I buy a better power supply ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Get a larger power supply , its the unsung hero of your system .	St
1.4.2	It has to be stable in order to support all those goodies that get stuffed in the system .	St
1.4.3	Another cause for a jittery display is either the fan you got is just plain lousy ( RFI cause ) or too close to the monitor itself .	St
1.4.4	The other causes mentioned by Robert are just as valid .	St
1.4.5	Next , having 512 is about as good as it gets for basic win9x/Me systems .	St
1.4.6	Get the ram first than add a faster processor , you benefit more from ram .	St
1.4.7	The faster processor is good but overall unless you increase its ability at 25 % performance , you probably wo n't notice and/or appreciate it & quot ; affectionly & quot ; .	St
1.4.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.5.1	I 'm typing from my old laptop which is some Compaq i266mmx with 64M RAM and Windows 2000 .	St
1.5.2	It never gets & quot ; stuck & quot ; .	St
1.5.3	I 'd find out what causes that issue and work on it .	St
1.5.4	Increasing RAM is fine , but 256 will do for most work except games , video editing , some Photoshop and other items .	St
1.5.5	I 'd not change that .	St
1.5.6	As to the power supply , with so little information supplied , it 's only a likely guess the PSU is stressed or just big enough .	St
1.5.7	You should fill in some details to see if you need more Watts .	Sug
1.5.8	I have to take care with just 64M RAM , but with Firefox running with 10 tabs open it just works fine .	St
1.5.9	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks you two .	St
1.6.2	How can I check if I need more Watts and how many ?	Ques
1.6.3	What is less expensive ?	Ques
1.6.4	Increasing RAM to 512 or buying a P3 933MHz processor ?	Ques
1.7.1	Followed your posts with Bob and Willy .	St
1.7.2	In reguards to your last post To open software quickly or faster will not be accomplished on your current system .	St
1.7.3	Over all system speed is the combined balance of system bus , memory and CPU .	St
1.7.4	See http : //www.yale.edu/pclt/PCHW/clockidea.htm http : //www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php ? article_id=5000186 Just my two cents Bill .	St
1.8.1	Upgrading is reasonably cheap these days , so if you can afford it do both at the same time .	St
1.8.2	I found multi-tasking a huge problem with 256RAM even when I got my machine updated ( only 256 came with the new motherboard ) .	St
1.8.3	So when I could afford it , I brought an extra 512RAM .	St
1.8.4	I have now got both 256 + 512 in my machine .	St
1.8.5	This runs both programs ( and games ) great and simultaneously.Processor speed does n't help if you do n't have the memory for the programs to go there ( and the processor to use that space - they are all interconnected like your body ) .	St
1.8.6	If you were to keep your old machine without updating the processor , get an extra 512 ( not 256 ) and if will help tremendously .	St
1.8.7	If you go the other option , and go through someone who does upgrades make sure you can either keep you old equipment in your PC or trade it in on the price of the upgrade .	St
1.8.8	Also see if they can do a deal for higher memory ( RAM ) packages .	St
1.8.9	Most newer computers take DDR RAM and you wo n't be able to use your old RAM in them once you upgrade .	St
1.8.10	Hope thats been helpful .	St
1.9.1	My PC has the AMD Athlon XP 2500+ CPU which is 1.82 GHz .	St
1.9.2	I have more than 70 icons on my screen which means I have lots of software .	St
1.9.3	Therefore , having more ram means more strength .	St
1.9.4	I usually have four or five programs running and therefore I have 1 GB ram .	St
1.9.5	The Intel had a new 775 CPU which mated to the new 915 motherboard and PCI display card .	St
1.9.6	These days , minimum ram will be 512 as they are the muscle .	St
1.9.7	Try to imagine a 2.8GHz with 256 ram .	St
1.9.8	The PC will be down all the time .	St
1.9.9	People are willing to go for ram , CPU , display card then motherboard .	St
1.9.10	I learned from one PC magazine that the former and the new CEO of Dell have in their PC .	St
1.9.11	CPU-3.0GHz RAM- 2 GB Harddrive- 160 GB Display card- ATI Radeon 9800 Pro DVD-ROM- 8xDVD+ So speed is not the main issue as there are many servers are still running 2.4GHz .	St
1.9.12	Go for the ram !	St
1.10.1	Dear Mr Chan I 've found from experience that the more icons you have on your desktop , the more RAM you use .	St
1.10.2	The best way is to delete all that are absolutely inessential and use the Start Menu .	St
1.10.3	What I 've done is to organise my Start menu into a series of sections , each devoted one topic - thus games are in the games section , Office programmes int he Office section and so on .	St
1.10.4	Also , the wattage output from the PSU is critical , I have used 350 W output , but 400 or 450 is about the best .	St
1.10.5	Because I 'm running XP I can get away with a large RAM , and with a 2GHz prcessor I 'm using 1Gb RAM , so far no problems .	St
1.10.6	As far as the screen is concerned , I DO N'T use a CRT screen , instead I use an LCD screen and use an ATI Radeon 9600XT graphics card , so stray magnetism is not a real problem with me ( the LCD is a flat panel screen so makes for desk use )	St
1.11.1	1 .	St
1.11.2	CPU vs RAM : I do software testing on three 'identical ' computers I 've been running for 3 years now .	St
1.11.3	I 'm testing a Windows filtering program so it 's doing some low level stuff .	St
1.11.4	They 're all 500MHz with 128meg RAM .	St
1.11.5	One was upgraded to 386 .	St
1.11.6	It usually finishes my basic test in 1hr30min versus the others which finish around 2hr15min .	St
1.11.7	Go with the RAM first .	St
1.11.8	2 .	St
1.11.9	Power supplies need to be rock solid - do n't purchase one for less than $ 40 .	St
1.11.10	I do n't see how anyone can manufacture a case and PS that 's worth using and sell it for $ 40 .	St
1.11.11	At home I also have a power conditioner right after the surge protector and that 's made a difference for me here in lightening plagued Central Florida .	St
1.11.12	- - -Jim	St
1.12.1	Based on my experience of using and building computers for over twenty years , I always recommend upgrading to as much RAM as you can afford or that your computer will allow .	St
1.12.2	It is relatively inexpensive and will provide the biggest noticeable improvement .	St
1.12.3	You did n't give to many specifics , but I have seen users of Windows XP who are on a dial-up -- say AOL -- and have McAfee virus scan and firewall who 's resources drop too low for AOL to operate correctly .	St
1.12.4	Many ( not all ) of the OS 's as well as virus scans and firewalls are huge resource eaters .	St
1.12.5	In today 's computing world , I would not have less than 512Ram and you can buy am additional 256Ram memory stick for as little as $ 30.00 .	St
1.13.1	Use this website or another to calulate your needs and then add 100W to it .	St
1.13.2	That way you have room to grow on and usually covers all bases .	St
1.13.3	It 's brute force , but just buy a 400W+ p/s unit and you 're there .	St
1.13.4	http : //www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ As for the ram vs. cpu , get the ram , it always a rule of thumb to increase ram first to improve system .	St
1.13.5	You can add the cpu later on top of the ram .	St
1.13.6	But a PIII is becoming a dated system , so you want to consider mit practical or not .	St
1.13.7	Ram has the *chance* of being used in a newer system should you decide to move on ( but not always ) .	St
1.13.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.14.1	1 ) I recommend upgrading both RAM and CPU , but if cash is short , do the CPU upgrade first .	Sug
1.14.2	Personally , I have a Duron 1.3 GHz CPU , and 640 MB RAM ( 128 + 512 ) and i still need more RAM and processor speed .	St
1.14.3	However , until you do upgrade your hardware , you can boost your RAM by adjusting Windows 's paging file .	St
1.14.4	Sure , it consumes some of your HDD , but it will work , until the upgrade is done .	St
1.14.5	2 ) My guess is that your power source does not produce enough Watts to satisfy all the needs of your system .	St
1.14.6	sure , it is OK without fan , but the moment you plug it in , you add another power consumer and it ca n't take it .	St
1.14.7	so , it cuts down on the power supplied to the monitor , to keep the fan , motherboard , CPU , and HDD running .	St
1.14.8	My advice ?	Ques
1.14.9	get a newer motherboard and power source .	St
1.14.10	a 400W power source should do the trick .	St
1.15.1	Its a toss-up .	St
1.15.2	Upgrading the processor may require a new motherboard and power supply .	St
1.15.3	Adding Ram would be less expensive and may improve performance .	St
1.15.4	If your not looking at gaming , and if your not trying to run memory intensive programs ( autocad and such ) , I would look at other factors .	St
1.15.5	256MB of ram in most systems is going to perform quite well .	St
1.15.6	( I run a computer lab at a major university , and have 20 of the systems described ) Cleaning up the drive , ensuring that there is plenty of virtual memory available , removing SPY-WARE and of course having a good viruscan program and autoscheduling of updates ( all ) should help .	St
1.15.7	As for the fan , if it connects to the Motherboard , it may be drawing to much current , or it may be faulty .	St
1.15.8	I would try another fan , and if the same results , have the power supply checked .	Sug
1.16.1	You must know what is the total output of your power supply .	St
1.16.2	If you put too many components into your casing this can cause some problems occur .	St
1.16.3	One is screen starts flickering .	St
1.16.4	Maybe you should check the power first .	Sug
1.17.1	Lets see if we can clear up some serious misconceptions about the power supply .	St
1.17.2	1 . )	St
1.17.3	The monitor does not draw power or plug into the computer power supply .	St
1.17.4	2 . )	St
1.17.5	It is the responsibility of the graphics card to drive the image on the monitor .	St
1.17.6	Therefore , it is the graphics card that is being affected by the power supply/extra fan , not the monitor .	St
1.17.7	As for the ram/processor debate , I vote for the ram first as the price vs. performance boost is much better .	St
1.17.8	That being said , I do n't believe we really have enough information to make the & quot ; best & quot ; decision .	St
1.17.9	With P4 2.66GHz systems selling for as little as $ 350.00 it might actually be more cost effective to go this route .	St
1.17.10	Sincerely , kwkid	St
1.18.1	My mother 's old Acer Aspire had 64Mb of RAM , and uses a 335Mb chip .	St
1.18.2	I replaced one of the RAM & quot ; sticks & quot ; ( 32Mb ) with a 128Mb stick .	St
1.18.3	The speed-up is awesome !	St
1.18.4	Ca n't say what changing the chip will do , but I think a new chip is a lot of money compared to buying a new RAM stick ( 128Mb for $ 59.95 ) .	St
1.19.1	If you decide to upgrade your RAM , which I suggest doing , you need to first find out the maximum your system will support .	St
1.19.2	You can contact your system or motherboard manufacturer to find this out .	St
1.19.3	I tried to upgrade my last system to 512 then found out after purchasing the RAM that it would only support 256 .	St
1.20.1	Unless you are crunching lot 's of numbers or running Doom 27 , adding more memory is the cheapest upgrade to your system that will noticably increase performance .	St
1.20.2	All of today 's Windows version use a large amount of memory for the operating system , anti-virus packages , and the other useful things that are loaded into the system at start-up .	St
1.20.3	The memory that 's left over is all that remains for your software .	St
1.20.4	Add another 256MB if your system can take it .	St
1.20.5	It 's inexpensive .	St
1.20.6	Some other tips .	St
1.20.7	Defragment your hard drive ( Help tells you how to do this ) .	St
1.20.8	If this is n't enough , a faster disk drive or a new video card might help .	St
1.20.9	Both should be around $ 80 in the stores .	St
1.21.1	On the RAM vs. CPU question : before you even GO there , try this -- set up a regular routine to delete *.tmp files , internet cached files and defrag the drive .	St
1.21.2	the disk defragger included in W2K and later is a licensed version which is OK ; you can buy the commercial version of DiskKeeper which is even better .	St
1.21.3	If you do a thorough defrag with no applications running once a week , you may find that you do n't need a hardware upgrade at all .	St
1.21.4	If you still want to do a hardware upgrade , there is no single answer to whether the CPU or RAM will be the best answer in your particular case ; the best way to approach this is to use the Performance Monitor tools to decide which element is the bottleneck , and decide from that which way will give you the most bang for your buck .	St
1.21.5	There are several white papers discussing the RAM and CPU counters to use , and how to interpret the results .	St
1.22.1	I know I did n't answer the second part of your question , but it would be good if people would actually answer the question other than tangent/side issues .	St
1.23.1	symbiosis to sum up Their is no good answer on what or when to update .	St
1.23.2	Too many parameters .	St
1.23.3	The flickering montior only occured when fan was added .	St
1.23.4	Too small or weak , from age , power supply .	St
1.23.5	Bill .	St
1.24.1	ans1 : for te software run faster I recomend u to upgrade ur processor , because it is cheaper & many software dont use great graphics [ excl photshop etc . ]	St
1.24.2	, also 256 mb ram is enough to take load of memory .	St
1.24.3	[ bcoz ihave 2.8 ht P 4 { 256 mb ram } & my pc is smooth to both the game & softwares . ]	St
1.24.4	but if graphics comes in ur software then 512 mb ram will make a difference .	St
1.24.5	ans2 : ur screen gone unstable most probably by the magnatic field of ur fan or some thing like that.I 'm assuming that u connact ur fan to any border of ur moniter 's body .	Sug
1.24.6	but if not so then it is tough for me ans 2nd one .	St
1.25.1	If you really want a good answer then you need to supply us with more information .	St
1.25.2	What MotherBoard do you have , video card , type of hard drive etc ... . Also what software are you trying to run ?	Ques
1.25.3	How much can you spend ?	Ques
1.25.4	What OS are you using ?	Ques
1.25.5	With this info you will get a much better answer .	St
1.25.6	Also it would help if you defined what your current power supply is .	St
1.25.7	You may also want to tell us how you connect to the internet .	St
1.25.8	CNET has some great programs that will tune your system so it works great .	St
1.25.9	If your unsure how to go about getting the info on your computer I am sure someone with netmeeting can browse your sytem and the tell you or even fix most of your problems remotely .	St
1.26.1	Well , I decided to do both things .	St
1.26.2	First I 'll add 256MB RAM to my 256MB that are installed .	St
1.26.3	I 'll upgrade my processor to P4 in an over-all upgrade to my system a couple of mounths from now .	St
1.26.4	I 've got time .	St
1.26.5	My main problem now is that flickering screen .	St
1.26.6	Tomorrow I 'll buy another fan and replace that one that I 've bought before .	St
1.26.7	I 'll update with the conclusion .	St
1.27.1	Please let us know if adding more RAM has helped your computer run a little quicker and smoother ?	Sug
1.27.2	?	Ques
1.28.1	I need to know which one is your os , because all of them are very diferents in ram requirements .	St
1.28.2	win xp and server 2003 eats a lot of ram	St
1.29.1	I 've got 2000 , but I 'll upgrade to XP/SP2 in a week .	St
1.30.1	Processor v memory Straight answer is undoubtably get more memory .	St
1.30.2	A bigger swap file is a poor cousin .	St
1.31.1	Make sure you get Professional ... Home is for wimps and misses on so much good stuff ! ! !	St
1.31.2	You may also want to get a tweaker like Tweak XP to run with it !	St
1.32.1	I played DOOM3 perfectly smooth .	Polite
1.32.2	It 's just a system thing .	St
1.32.3	I saw some tips on optimizing your computer to be game ready this link it on for Half Life 2 but I am sure it also applys to everything else .	St
1.32.4	I think it has some really good tips .	St
1.32.5	you can check it out here http : //gear.ign.com/articles/554/554744p1.html about the DOOM3 I believe it 's the video card mainly..	St
1.32.6	I use a x800Pro from ATI .	St
1.33.1	I would start with the power supply - is it at lest 350 adding new hardware like fans should not affect the mb/monitor unless its over heating or power is low Is the present fans in the computer real dirty ( power supply and others ) i have one my wife uses 800mhz with 6 cards and 4 fans and 350 PS it runs great starship warrior	St
1.34.1	It sounds like your power supply is either faulty or at it 's max .	St
1.34.2	not sure what graphics card your running some of them are very power hungry .	St
1.34.3	some manufacturers overrate thair power supplys !	St
1.34.4	Id fix the fan issue before worrying about upgrading ! !	St
1.34.5	!	St
1.35.1	I am very curious as to what type of person can resort to name calling due to an OS choice ?	Ques
1.35.2	Does this individual really believe that they are actually a better computer user or even a better person by resorting to calling everyone who uses the Home Edition of XP wimps ?	Ques
1.35.3	I use Professional due to heightened security issues while traveling and because it is our company standard .	St
1.35.4	At home , my wife uses the Home Edition .	St
1.35.5	I do n't consider my wife , or anyone else for that matter , to be inferior for this decision .	St
1.35.6	Both Home and Professional have their plus and minus ' .	St
1.35.7	An individual 's choice should not cause them to be called names .	St
1.35.8	I believe the individual who posted this remark should take the high road and apologize for demeaning the users of this software .	St
1.35.9	Sincerely , kwkid	St
1.36.1	He wants to know what he should upgrade to run regular programs .	St
1.36.2	Not games .	St
1.36.3	And you video card costs more than his system is worth .	St
1.36.4	If he had that kind of sqrill he would have probably just bought a new rig a long time ago .	St
1.36.5	I mean , he is n't even running 933mhz .	St
1.36.6	You vid card runs at atleast 550MHz if you got the good one .	St
1.37.1	Check those posting dates ... .	St
