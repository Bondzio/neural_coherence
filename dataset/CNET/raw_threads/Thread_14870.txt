I am trying to figure out how to remedy this. First let me tell you what I have done to the computer. I added a plug and play cd rom and storage device.I also have a slave drive running the computer. I use the plugin device for downloading, but run the programs from the c drive. Besides that I have basic windows and microsoft word stuff and two video games. Any good place to start? What are my virus or otherwise potential? oh,I have a gateway that is about two years old and run windows xp thank you much steve

Low Virtual Memory warings often indicates your Hard Drive is virtually full, and may appear only when you're using programs like M$ Word and games, which use a huge amount of System RAM / Virtual Memory. 1. Double click &quot;My Computer&quot; icon on your desktop 2. Right click Drive C: 3. choose &quot;Properties&quot; (it's at the bottom of the list) 4. In the General tab (running along the top) click the &quot;Disk Cleanup&quot; button 5. put a Checkmark in all the boxes and click &quot;OK&quot; You can do that on all your drives too, to recover wasted space. Modern games can easily take a couple of Gigabytes of Hard Drive storage space each, and the system files such as Pagefile, and Virtual Memory are another couple each too. You didn't detail (anything) but this can easily use up a lot of hard drive space, and then you'll get Virtual memory errors! Good luck, GeeBee.
