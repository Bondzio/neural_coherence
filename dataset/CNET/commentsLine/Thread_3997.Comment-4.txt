thanks!
it seems you know what you are talking about.
i have seen this in other computers that i've worked on and i have told the client the same thing.
just let it run.
i guess i feel kind of stupid not knowing why this is happening to even my own computer now when it wasn't for years.
i really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question, again thanks!
