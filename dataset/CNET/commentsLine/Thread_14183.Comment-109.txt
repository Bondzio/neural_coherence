feb 5,2005 was the purchase of a pii.
the man i bought it from was a programer for raytheon,and it was for his daughter.so, i'm very new to p.c.
's,but i've learned allot since that first purchase.
basically i've learned that i've allot to learn!i've gone from the pii to a piv generic(no company like dell,compaq,etc.
)and the xp pro os won't work on it because it's not a dell.
