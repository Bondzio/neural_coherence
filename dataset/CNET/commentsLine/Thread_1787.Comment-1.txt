hi!
i hope someone will be able to help me here and that i might actually learn something at the same time!
i work off a couple of lacie drives but for some or other reason i am unable to delete anything off these drives and restore the memory that was taken up before i deleted an item/project.. therefor up until now i have always just finished a project on a certain drive and then formatted the whole drive to clean it up.
this means that i can not choose what i want to delete, because even if i delete it off the drive (stash it into the trash), the memory is still in use and the drive still fills up.
this is starting to become a problem because i have quite a few projects running at the moment and am running out of space!
if anyone can maybe help me and explain to me if there is a different way in which i can clean the drives without losing specific folders or projects i would really appreciate it!
it is quite hard to explain but i hope what im asking makes sense!
thank you!
