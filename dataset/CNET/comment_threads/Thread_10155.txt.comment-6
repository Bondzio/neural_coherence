Hi there, I don't know how relevant my post is in the context of this thread but I just wanted to let everyone know that I came across a new free terminal &quot;ClearTerminal&quot; which seems to be good.You can try this one out if you need a replacement for putty or any other terminal.
It's available at http://www.clearconnex.com/content/clearterminal Have a good time
