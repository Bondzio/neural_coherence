<s> Hi all, Sorry if this has been asked to death but here is my situation. </s>
<s> I've set-up a home network with two XP machines and one Win98 machine, which is connected to the house's printer. </s>
<s> I am currently able to print through the network from the two XP nodes, but only when the Win98 machine is on. </s>
<s> So everytime I want to print, I have to run down two floors, turn on the old system, wait for it to boot (5+ min), then print. </s>
<s> Is there a way to set-up the printer so I don't have to turn on the Win98 machine and just leave the printer on 24/7 ready to print from the XP machines? </s>
<s> It's done in offices, is it not? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I need a print server don't I? </s>
<s> Since you already have a working network, just put your printer directly &quot;on the wire&quot;. </s>
<s> You didn't say what type of connection your printer has, but even if it's Parallel, you can buy one for about $50-$75 that goes from Parallel (USB,ect) to RJ45 (LAN Cable)and has a Web based interface to setup. </s>
<s> I've use in an office environment and it worked well. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
