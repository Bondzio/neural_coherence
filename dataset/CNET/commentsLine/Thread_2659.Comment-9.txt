seems like someone changed the poll question but not the answer selections or vice versa.
the question that headed the poll that i received read: which microsoft windows version would you consider the worst?
(please click on button to vote) fujitsu (why?)
hitachi (why?)
ibm (why?)
maxtor (why?)
samsung (why?)
seagate (why?)
western digital (why?)
other (which brand?)
i have no idea
