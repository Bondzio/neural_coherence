I have a d-link wbr-1310 router and everytime the phone rings and is picked up, my internet connection becomes unplugged.
I am new with routers & Cox Cable says it's the router.
Has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen?
It's very frustrating.
Remember I am a rookie too.
