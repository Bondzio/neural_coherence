1.1.1	Hey, I wanted to upgrade my motherboard.	St
1.1.2	I think my other one has had it and so does the guy at the computer store.	St
1.1.3	If I'm going to upgrade, then I'd like something that fits my needs.	St
1.1.4	I want a motherboard that will stand up to programs such as editing software including AVID, Photoshop, Illustrator, Aftereffects...to run simultaneously.	St
1.1.5	I currently have two gigs of ram (DDR2) that I purchased which my current motherboard cannot handle.	St
1.1.6	So it would need to support those.	St
1.1.7	It needs to be fast.	St
1.1.8	I'm assuming Intel 4 Dual Core Processor...but what do I know?	St
1.1.9	I would like a pretty decent graphics card...at least to support guitar hero!!	St
1.1.10	It also should have at least 4 slots for additional cards.	St
1.1.11	Any suggestions would be much appreciated??	St
1.1.12	Obviously want it as cheap as possible, but able to support what I have listed...Thanks.	St

1.2.1	mobo: asus p5q se plus, $97: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131347 cpu: core2quad q8200, $190: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115055 video: geforce 9600gt, $102: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127382 add another gig of ram and you should be set.	St
1.3.1	As for the graphics card...I intend to use Avid Express Pro.	St
1.3.2	They recommend to only us NVIDIA.	Sug
1.3.3	Is this just they're way to promote NVIDIA, or will the program actually not work if it isn't an NVIDIA?	St
1.3.4	?	Ques
1.4.1	the geforce line is aimed at consumers while quadros are aimed at business/professional users.	St
1.4.2	both use the same GPUs, but quadros include special drivers which are tailored for advanced open-gl use.	St
1.4.3	in practice, a geforce will run any app that a quadro will, but you might run into minor bugs (crawling lines, shadows not visible, etc).	St
1.4.4	whether or not the bugs are show-stoppers for your work (or even evident in your app) is up to you to decide.	St
1.4.5	check the forums to see what other users of the app use/recommend: http://community.avid.com/forums/14.aspx	Sug
1.5.1	Thanks for the info...just one other thing I'd like to inquire about before I purchase.	St
1.5.2	I currently have a Pentium D processor.	St
1.5.3	I was just curious to know how this compares to what you suggested, and if its worth me purchasing another one?	St
1.6.1	at any video task.	St
1.6.2	the q8200 is comparable to a q6600, so compare that processor with your p4d in these charts: http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/cpu-charts-2007/Encoding-Video-H-264-MPEG-4,358.html	St
1.7.1	Hey, I appreciate your help thus far.	Polite
1.7.2	I have purchased what you suggested, and I am left with one last inquiry.	St
1.7.3	The power supply that I have is a Retail Plus 465 Watt with a dual fan.	St
1.7.4	I just want to make sure this will be fine to power my new hardware.	St
1.7.5	The guy at the store mentioned that I would need something at least 500 watts.	St
1.7.6	Just wanted to know your thought.	St
1.7.7	Thanks	Polite
