Sorry.	http://www.technologyvault.co.uk/geforce/faq.php?display=faq&nr=21&catnr=2&prog=gef&lang=en There are replacement coolers out there for some of the GeForce cards. My mind didn't think to look beyond the sources I use to solve this issue. For the people I deal with will not part with the money for a tennmax cooler so I just use generic fans. However I always get a ball bearing fan if I think the card/system will need to be used for more than a few months. Hint: Exacto blade knives, tin snips, plastic nuts, bolts and even plastic cable ties all make for great source material and tools to fashion a new fan mount. Sometimes I have to take up space that blocks the adjacent PCI slot, but what other choice do we have? At least at this price... Bob
