i have to admit that i am to some extent accustomed to post here and chatter over trifles when i am free and spend a lot time with my gadgets.
but there always comes some boring things, such as the low power of ipads and phones.
and sometimes i found the usb connectors on my pc is not enough to support my work as convenient as possible.
so i searched on amazon and found a relatively suitable item maybe i can use to solve the trouble .
but as i was used to buy peripherals from other sellers, i have no information about this.
could you guys tell me your experience on the products from this seller?
does this item worth being consider as a perfect one?or some better choice?
