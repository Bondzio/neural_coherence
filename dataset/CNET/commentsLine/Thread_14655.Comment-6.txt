or go for something that helps put the usb back into operation we have the long discussion at  and many suggestions.
i find turning off the notification does return the usb to operation but this will never placate those that want a &quot;true fix.&quot; for that the makers have to issue new hardware, bios and drivers.
(good luck?)
