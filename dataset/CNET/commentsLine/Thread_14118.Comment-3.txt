the only thing i can think of that i did wrong is put the fan that sits over the cpu heatsink wrong (never took the heatsink out), but it's still sitting over it doing it's job, i just twisted it one more space than was supposed to.
the graphics card is out-dated so no power connectors.
i'll try with only 1 stick of ram and post again and post back in a few minutes.
