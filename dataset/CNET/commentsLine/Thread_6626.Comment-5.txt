on nearly every file system i have ever worked with, including mac, windows, and linux, if you paste a file in a folder and then you attempt to paste (or move) another file with the identical name, it will ask if you want to replace the first one or cancel the second one.
if you are moving or copying a bunch of files and just a few are already in the file where you are moving them to.
then the same window will pop up asking you if you want to replace (or overwrite) the existing file or skip on to the next file without pasting that identical file a second time.
you can even check a box so it will take the same action for all you are trying to move when a copy already exist, so you don't have to sit there and press the same button again and again.
