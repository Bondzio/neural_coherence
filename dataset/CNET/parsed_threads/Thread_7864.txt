<s> I have a motherboard (ASUS P4PE-x) that supports PC3200, which gives the machine a faster front side bus (fsb). </s>
<s> I originally began with a single PC2700 - 512 RAM. </s>
<s> I bought two 256 RAM sticks of PC3200, and removed the PC2700. </s>
<s> My question now is, I have three slots for memory, can I run PC3200 w/PC2700? </s>
<s> it will operate at the 333mhz rate. </s>
<s> this if course given it's the same kind of ram just different speeds. </s>
<s> What does the book that came with your ASUS P4PE-x say? </s>
<s> You can put different speeds in, but they will all run at the slower speed. </s>

<s> Never miss match ram! </s>
<s> It defeats the purpose! </s>
<s> Sell the pc2700 on ebay and buy pc3200 to match what you have. </s>
<s> Better yet I would look for three sticks of 512 at 3200 that match. </s>
<s> More bang for your bucks! </s>
