I have found a thread somewhere on the net that mentioned a solution not mentioned anywhere else, and it worked!
It worked also for the other people in the thread.
They say to just write the IP of the other computer in the default gateway (the IP that is automatically assigned, although you could also assign it manually)...
I did it for both computers and it worked, although I had not shared all folders, so only a few were shared, but both computers appeared in the network...
