<s> Hey, everybody. </s>
<s> I was wondering if someone could help me out with this problem. </s>
<s> I bought a brand-new Samsung ML-2010 laser printer from Buy.com about a month and a half ago, and I've been having this recurring issue with it. </s>
<s> The printer worked like a charm for the first few weeks, but now its useless. </s>
<s> The problem used to pop up here and there, but now I cant print anything at all. </s>
<s> Basically, every time I turn on the printer, it warms up (or attempts to) and after a few seconds, the red error light starts blinking. </s>
<s> If I try to print a document, I get a message saying that theres been a fuser error. </s>
<s> I dont know what that is, and Samsungs troubleshooting utility didn't give me anything beyond the ol Turn it off, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. </s>
<s> If that doesnt work, contact a service representative method. </s>
<s> I havent been able to find any solutions on Samsungs support site, and nothing helpful came up when I googled the terms Samsung fuser error (or variants). </s>
<s> If anyone has any useful information at all, Id really appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> FYI, Im using: Toshiba Satellite A55-S326 notebook Intel Pentium M 1.6 GHz 512 MB RAM (shared video memory) Windows XP Home SP2 USB 2.0 connection to printer starter toner cartridge (it came with the printer) </s>
<s> A fuser problem is serious but since this is a new printer, use the warranty now. </s>
<s> Don't play with it as more than likely you can't recover and you *MAY VOID* the warranty in any attempts, so use the warranty. </s>
<s> You should have returned it immediately once the problem cropped-up to be within the quicker satifaction settlement period, you may now have to deal with a warranty center if not the vendor themselves for repair, but start the process. </s>
<s> Plus, document this as well, cal,s letters, etc. </s>
<s> to best serve yourself if any other problems arise. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I had the same issue, but right after the warranty ran out. </s>
<s> My Mac can see the printer, but nothing prints, and the two front-panel lights blink in unison. </s>
<s> Talked to a sales rep for a mail-order place and she chuckled and implied that this is all-too-common with this series. </s>
<s> She suggested an HP as a replacement. </s>
<s> So much for Samsung... </s>
<s> I don't know if parts are readily available for fixing the ML. </s>
<s> The good news is the 2010 is so darn cheap its just as good to buy new as any repair costs. </s>
<s> The same for HP, especially low end models. </s>
<s> I believe the ML-2010 is under $100 online maybe better to google away for a source. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have had more than 7 of these printers.. bought on sale at buy.com and staples... and given to family members and friends.. </s>
<s> Sadly the story is always the same. </s>
<s> At first they work fine.. but in as little as a week or two you either get fuser error which is the kiss of death... or the paper jam light as the paper goes halfway in and then just stops. </s>
<s> Now I've spoken to Samsung about this and they just stonewall you!! </s>
<s> Exactly what I mean by that is any solution generally costs more than what you paid for the printer new! </s>
<s> I had the fuser error after no more than 30 prints total on the machine and since it was a NEW MACHINE but had been sitting unopened in the box for over a year SAMSUNG WOULD DO NOTHNIG EXCEPT talk in circles telling me to PAY MORE THAN IT COST NEW!! </s>
<s> REMEMBER... this was after only 30 prints total on the machine!!!! </s>
<s> I think there should be a public YOUTUBE video session of people taking Samsung products and throwing them out the window, smashing below,.. to the music/soundtrack of their customer support giving useless excuses that cost more than the product did in the first place. </s>
<s> I've written to three different addresses for higher up help at Samsung and they have never got back to me. </s>
<s> Samsung USA is managed by Korean transplants who SEEM NOT TO CARE the way you might expect an executive from a US firm would. </s>
<s> Their corporate culture apparently is aloof and unresponsive to consumer sentiments. </s>
