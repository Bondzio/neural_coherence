old hp laserjets from the 1990's can still be worthwhile printers.
stuff does wear on them (particularly the rubber feed rollers), so it'd be best to buy from an expert who will give some warranty.
(yes, toner cartridges are still readily available for 15 year old printers.)
or, try asking on freecycle, and you may score one for nothing but the cost of a new cartridge.
apart from that... what the other guy said.
look at what staples is selling, take notes, then check the online reviews.
