be patient, and shop around some more.
i bought a pinnacle moviebox, and it's been nothing but a royal pain.
even worse, there's no tech support available - they don't answer the phone, and email replies, when you get them, are just like automated searches of their faqs.
for me, i can't even submitt a tech assistance request, because my &quot;product&quot; isn't listed on their drop down menu.
the software that came with it, studio 9.4 seems to work well enough, mostly, except that it incorporates quicktime, which has always given me problems in the past (hangs and stop errors, etc) there are several other similar products out there.
don't go with the pinnacle just because they're the only ones on the shelf at circuit city.
check out other forums, like at camcorderinfo.com or consumerreports.com, and see what they have to say.
