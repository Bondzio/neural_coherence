i have installed 3 brand-new 80gb maxtor internal hard drives in my computer.
every one of them makes a loud clicking noise like a geiger counter, when scanning the registry and files for viruses, spyware, etc.
the last hard drive i installed even makes clicking noises, when it's booting up, and an hd monitoring application called hdd health shows a t.e.c.
(threshold exceeded condition) date of 2/15/2005, which indicates the new hd could fail anytime soon.
hdd health uses s.m.a.r.t.
to monitor hard drive soundness.
in all three cases, it indicated a degradation in seek time performance and a combination of other errors, although my pc always booted and ran normally with no detectible glitches.
i originally purchased the maxtor hd from an online company, but subsequently decided to deal directly with maxtor, when the second installed drive made the same loud clicking noises as the first one.
a maxtor customer service rep i talked to asked me to put my telephone receiver right up to the pc tower, so that he could hear what kind of sounds i was complaining about.
he confirmed that the sound was due to a defective hard drive and that i should return it to his company for replacement.
well, the new hard drive they sent me is even noiser than the two others before it.
when i called maxtor about the replacement drive, a different customer service rep told me the noise was normal and part of the hard drive's seek process.
has anyone had the same experiences with noisy maxtor drives like i described?
is this normal for all maxtor internal hds?
i can't believe the noise is normal, because the original ibm h/d that came with my dell computer never made any noise at all.
should i return the latest maxtor h/d for another one, which would make it the fourth one, or should i try a different brand like western digital?
