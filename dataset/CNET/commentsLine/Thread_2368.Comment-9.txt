the webcams i mentioned will give you reasonably smooth video and full audio for you to enjoy the ceremony 'live'.
going up to 30fps will increase your bandwidth and you might wind up with dropouts/stutters.
the web cam should be close to the priest/officiator.
consider an external mic to ensure you get decent sound.
(a clip-on mic for the priest/officiator would be great.)
i assume the ceremony will be also be taped on a real camcorder since it will be far better than anything from a web cam.
