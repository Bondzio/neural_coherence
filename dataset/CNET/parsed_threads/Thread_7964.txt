<s> I have a new Compaq computer with Vista, and a 2002 netgear router, that has been upgraded with newest firmware and a netgear wg111v3 adapter. </s>
<s> The computer says, very good signal strength, and you are connected to wireless network. </s>
<s> It says no problems with connection. </s>
<s> When I open Internet Explorer, it defaults to (runonce.msn.com) Then I type in google, and it opens Google with just a little info in it, then after about 3 minutes, it open fully. </s>
<s> What can I do to fix this problem ? </s>
<s> It shows it is receiving at 11 mps. </s>
<s> My router is supplying my other hardwired computer at 100 mps. </s>
<s> Setup per our forum sticky? </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 In short, SSID broadcasting, WPA security and no other changes? </s>
