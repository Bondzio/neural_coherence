since it's 1 month old and store bought how is it that you are having to repair it?
just wondering.
so far i don't see any glaring clue here except maybe a bum os install.
one owner complained to me and we found a pirated xp os.
what to do then?
but this is not saying you have such but any clue would be appreciated to see if something that others have seen will show.
