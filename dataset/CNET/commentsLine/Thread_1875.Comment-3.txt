sorry, the correct model number is f5d9230-4, ver 3100. what is weird (at least to this novice) is that when i set up the router, it stopped letting me connect through the normal dsl connection at all.
it seems to now connect through the local area connection.
as i write this, i am connected to the internet, but my pppoe connection says disconnected.
the only connection working right now is the local area connection.
