I have a Cisco 3750 Wireless controler with multiple access points.
Everything is up and running except for when I restart and laptop with wireless connections I get the IP Address conflict popup on my computers.
I am setup with Static IP addresses and am positive there are no duplicate nodes.
The laptop will connect in the morning fine but if I restart the laptop it conflicts.
Looking for alittle advice if there is a function of the wireless that would hold the address looking for the old connection and not refresh with the new connection?
network still works fine and I am able to access and my data but the popup is an annoyance and I think it is messing with my wireless printers when they go into standby and conflicting connections.
