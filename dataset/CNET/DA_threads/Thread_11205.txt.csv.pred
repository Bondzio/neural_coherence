1.1.1	Without switching out my MOBO , Im looking to get the most out of the upgrade potential for my current Socket 939 system .	St
1.1.2	By the middle of next year , I will build a new system around an AMD AM2 board or Intel Core Duo CPU , but I dont want to jump into that until then .	St
1.1.3	In the meantime , again , Im looking to figure out the best upgrade options for my current system .	St
1.1.4	My main priority is to get the most gaming potential from my current system as possible : I play BF2 , COD/COD2 , Oblivion , Red Orchestra , Day of Defeat mostly FPS games .	St
1.1.5	For my job I also multi-task quite a bit with internet browsers and the Office suite ( I dont really do any DVD/CD burning or anything like that ) .	St
1.1.6	With the fall of the AMD 64 X2 prices , my immediate reaction was to grab a 3800+ X2 ( or higher ) and another gig of ram .	St
1.1.7	However , Im unsure about the performance gain Ill get from the new CPU and Ive heard that if I fill up all four of my memory slots that my system will only run my RAM at 333 rather than 400 ( is this true ) .	St
1.1.8	So , Im wondering if I can get a significant performance gain by 1 .	St
1.2.1	and see what that shows about the CPU options and their performance with ganes and other apps .	St
1.2.2	2GBs DDR400 is fairly cheap if the games in question load and run faster with 2GB vs 1 GB .	St
1.2.3	The other thing is there are some 'transition ' MB ..like the one from ASRock VSTA ( see review at Anandtech.com ) that allows you to run a Conroe with DDR , DDR2 , AGP or PCIe .	St
1.2.4	And it 's very modestly priced .	St
1.2.5	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Hello , I just upgraded from a 3000+ to a 4000+ & it is a substantial improvement .	St
1.3.2	It 's like a new computer .	St
1.3.3	Not that it was n't fast before , it 's just noticeably faster now .	St
1.3.4	I got the San Diego core from NewEgg for 135 .	St
1.3.5	2.4GHz tooling along at 2.7Ghz & it 's not even breaking a sweat .	St
1.3.6	I did n't opt for a dual-core .	St
1.3.7	I just do n't think there are enough applications out there to support it yet .	St
1.3.8	I believe multicore is the way of the future , but the benefits do n't justify the cost , at this time .	St
1.3.9	Your memory is fine , for now .	Polite
1.3.10	Take the extra money & put it towards a new video card .	St
1.3.11	You can use a video card in your next PC .	St
1.3.12	Look into the 7600GT , 7900GT or a X1900XT .	St
1.3.13	My PC games like never before .	St
1.3.14	Enjoy !	St
1.4.1	athlon 64 x2 4200+ , $ 199 inc. shipping ( zipzoomfly ) radeon x1900gt , $ 202 inc. shipping ( newegg ) if you prefer nvidia , an xfx 7900gt is $ 240 inc. shipping after rebate now .	St
1.4.2	if you wait a week or two , the 7950gt will be out and the 7900gt should drop to $ 210 or lower .	St
1.4.3	both the x1900gt and 7900gt will be faster than dual 7600gt .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814142063 It should come back in stock soon .	St
1.5.2	If you do n't want to wait , then that X1900GT is good ; this X1800XT is a little better : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814195019	Ques
