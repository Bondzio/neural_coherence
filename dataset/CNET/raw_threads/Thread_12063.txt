Just caught it on something the wrong way I guess and POP it came right off. I guess it doesn't happen all the time, but i feel like it happens more than it should. Does anyone know of a good sturdy cable that maybe doesn't have a tab to lock it in?

I was pretty rough with my cables and the tabs always popped off in my bag on the way to class. Now I get my network cables from www.tendonusa.com They have a tab protector thing that works really well. They were inexpensive too. Try them out, you won't be sorry.
