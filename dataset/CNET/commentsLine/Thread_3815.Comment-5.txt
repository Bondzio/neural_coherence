kodak has a line of photo scanners marketed towards businesses that are similar to the auto-feed ones on target photo lab kiosks, just without the kiosk.
these are nice because they have a straight path for feeding the photos and soft rollers, so the originals are much less likely to get scratched up.
you will still need to clean the lenses of the scanner periodically as you scan photos so that dust does not cause them to have small streaks in the scanned image.
the early model was the s1220, which was replaced a couple of years ago by the ps410 and ps810.
at 600 dpi resolution, the ps410 and ps810 operate at almost the same speed.
at 300 dpi, the ps810 is much faster.
- 300 dpi ps410 vs ps810 speed comparison  - 600 dpi ps410 vs ps810 speed comparison the ps810 is a bit more expensive than the ps410.
in addition to the bumped hardware specs at 300 dpi, it includes some more software options, including for file naming.
both scanners can output batches of photos to named folders.
if you want advanced file renaming options and go the ps410 route, i'd check out the freeware bulk rename utility program for windows (google it.
awesome little utility.).
the kodak photo scanners mentioned above are not through their consumer division, so they aren't going to be found at a best buy.
they are actually manufactured by the company's document imaging division.
a google or amazon search should turn up resellers.
there are also some places out there that will rent them if you're just looking to do a one-time project instead of owning one.
