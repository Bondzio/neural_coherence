but power supplies never run at there stated power and realistically you only get about 85% efficiency of that number.
so keep that in mind.
also, stock psu's typically do not come with the 2 4-pin connectors.
they barely come with sata power.
you can easily pick up psu's cheap these days, so it may be within your means to pick one up with your card.
that way you pave the way for future upgrades.
also, if it's a stock dell, i do not recommend adding an aftermarket psu as dell has been known for it's proprietary hardware.
