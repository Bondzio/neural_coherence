<s> I can only support a graphics card which fits in a pci slot because my computer is a bit older and it is hard to tell the difference between the bad and the good and the best. </s>
<s> so what is the best for a pci slot? </s>
<s> preferably under 150$. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP BECAUSE I NEED IT SOON! </s>
<s> Just read about it the other day, it's easily the best pci graphics card out there. </s>
<s> Good luck finding one, though. </s>
<s> Supposedly costs about $130, but there's probably limited availability, if you can find one at all, so prices might be a bit steeper. </s>
<s> Look at CC and BB, Newegg's supposed to carry, but isn't available yet. </s>
<s> i can't find one so far that fits in a pci slot are you sure that it isn't only for pci-e or agp? </s>
<s> i just found one! </s>

<s> I could be wrong, but I didn't think that there were any X1300 cards for PCI. </s>
