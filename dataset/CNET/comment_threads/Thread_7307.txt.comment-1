Installed a new Seagate Sata hd in my wifes tower for more storage space, BIOS is as current as possible,so is windows xp.
Bios will not recognize hd, as I did not install sata raid drivers last time I installed new ide hard drive.
Is there a driver for the ASUS motherboard of her a600n hp tower, I can install, without reinstalling windows.
only added hd for storage.
computer has 2 ide hd's now, but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd.
Hd is a Seagate SATA also.
Thanks in advance.
