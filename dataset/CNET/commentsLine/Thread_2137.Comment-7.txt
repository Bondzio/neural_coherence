if you're not a builder, and don't plan on building, dell is not a bad choice.
i've had 5 and had good service.
i have just completed an e 6300 build.
1 gig will be fine as long as you choose a very good video card with whatever system you choose.
don't choose intergrated graphics as your option.
in my benchmark tests, i have found that onboard graphix will utilize a little too much ram and elevated the cpu temperature with the c2d systems.
the 6600 is the sweet spot.
you won't be overclocking for two reasons: intel and dell.
believe me, you won't need to overclock with a c2d.
