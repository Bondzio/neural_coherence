184	4	510644	5050605	5050300	puredeadradio	12/21/10 7:21 AM	1.29291606E12	I think the manufacturers were in LAZY mode	There's a lot I don't know about networking, but can I ask what may be a couple stupid questions? I'm attempting to join these two routers with my existing wireless router - Qwest 2Wire 2701HG-D (which is also my modem). The reason I'm trying to do this is I would like my network to be connected to the entertainment center, but I can't move my Qwest router out there because there are no phone jacks in the living room. I was thinking if I could wire the 2Wire to one of the Tendas, I could wirelessly bridge to the other Tenda that would be wired to our entertainment center. I've scoured the internet looking for help everywhere I can think, from the manufacturer's website (which is about as helpful as the manual), to the MicroCenter's tech website (which was more helpful, but didn't solve the problem), to Googling all versions of this problem I can think of and following various how-tos. Either I'm overlooking something very simple, or the problem is more complex than I'm realizing. Here's a couple of my recent attempts - keep in mind, I found how-to instructions on each of these methods online, so forgive me if they are flat-out ridiculous. I've tried configuring all three routers onto the same wireless network - SSID, channel, etc. I've tried configuring the two Tenda routers onto their own wireless network that would only bridge between the two. My question now is if I assigned LAN IP addresses to each router, but all wireless settings are set to dynamic IP, would that affect the bridge? If I want to strictly bridge the two Tenda routers, would they have to be on the same channel? I've swapped MAC addresses between the two - am I missing something? Any/all help is greatly appreciated - We tried calling the Tenda US support hotline and got a busy signal. Thanks

I read that manual and even armed with my knowledge from writing router software years ago I came up with no sure fire way or new instructions for you. With such a poor manual I bet the support lines are jammed. -&gt; But when I want to bridge, I never have to configure my first wifi router in any new or different way than all the usual setups. I wonder if you are tripping up yourself here. That is, set up the first wifi router just like any other wifi router then try the other as a bridge. Now if you have some other gear that was not noted, I would not know that. Bob

I have but have yet to have success finding it

I finally used Google cache to read the deleted post in this tree, which said an older version of the firmware works. I couldn't find the version mentioned there, but I decided to use the one on the website (V3.2.5e-W268R): http://www.tenda.cn/downloads/list.php?catid=11&pdcatid=22 I then followed the method described here (even though it's a different model, the steps are the same): http://www.strayed.co.uk/2010/04/15/tenda-wireless-n-150-router-unboxing-setup-review/ The only difference is I left both of my WDS modes in Bridge and put the other Router's MAC address in as described for only one of the routers in his post. Lazy mode might work as he suggests, but I'm not changing mine now that it works. Also, the routers don't show up when I 'Open Scan' for them now, but that might be because they're already in the access list. If you can't find yours, you might try manually entering them. Thrilled this finally works. I can now reach the internet from my computer connected to the wireless router that isn't directly connected to the WAN port. Yay. Incidently, I'm not sure that the firmware is different between these models. I did a binary diff of one of the versions between the 311 and 286, and they were identical. I even tried updating using one of 311 firmwares on my 286, and it looked like it was working. I'd stick to the 286 3.2.5e firmware, though, as I know that one works.

Greetings- From what I've read here (thanks) as well as on the link you posted from strayed.co.uk, I know that downgrading my router firmware to 3.2.5e is the key to getting this to work. ...but I can't get the darn thing to take the firmware change. I'm connected directly between a computer and one of the yellow LAN ports, and I can navigate to the Router's web interface by browsing to 192.168.0.1 and successfully change any settings there, but when I tell it to &quot;upgrade&quot; the firmware to the 3.2.5e .bin file that I've unzipped, it appears to go through the &quot;upgrading&quot; -- &quot;rebooting&quot; process, but even after a manual reboot the thing still says it has &quot;Firmware Version H1_V3.3.6g_EN&quot;. I've tried literally half a dozen times, using two different computers, two different browsers (IE and Firefox), and even two different downloads of the firmware. Any suggestions before I tear all of my hair out? Thanks in advance.

184	22	510644	5211731	5211658	knagl	10/2/11 5:12 PM	1.31757552E12	I've tried other versions and it still won't change	Thanks for the reply, Bob. For the Tenda W268R, the oldest firmware they offer on their site is 3.2.5e (the one I've been trying to use). I tried a different one (3.3.6d) and again the upgrade wouldn't take -- after reboot, it still showed that it was running 3.3.6g. It's as if the router is either not willing to flash itself to another version, or something is preventing it from changing. In my frustration last night I did try it via Wi-Fi which also didn't work. As soon as the update process started it dropped the connection. The router didn't seem any worse for wear, though -- it still showed 3.3.6g after the &quot;upgrade&quot; attempt. I'm curious if anyone with one of these cheap POS Tenda routers ever encountered the issue I'm bumping up against, and how they got around it?

Updates are done over ethernet. 2. I've encountered a few that fail to update unless I use Internet Explorer. Best of luck, Bob

184	26	510644	5212034	5211727	knagl	10/3/11 11:07 AM	1.31764002E12	And I noted that I wasn't using wi-fi to update	As noted in my original post (10/2/2011 at 2:54pm), I was connected directly between a LAN port on the router and my computer via an ethernet cable. After you mentioned that &quot;some try to do this over wifi&quot; did I mention that as a last resort after a number of unsuccessful attempts directly connected did I try via wi-fi, with the same unsuccessful results. I also noted that I tried using both Internet Explorer and Firefox with the same results. With the new post yesterday by Yakub1 in this thread, it further confirms to me that there is a problem trying to downgrade the firmware on this router, and that I'm not the only one who has experienced this issue. As Yakup1 said, it would be very helpful if someone who has this router and managed to downgrade their firmware would see this thread and post how they did it. Regardless, I've pretty much given up. I found an older ASUS WL-330gE 4-in-1 adapter/gateway/AP/repeater that I managed to configure in repeater mode and was able to accomplish what I've been trying unsuccessfully to do with the Tenda W268R.

What version of firmware did you have on the router before? The 3.2.4.02s firmware has a warning screen on the download page that says, &quot;version V3.2.4.02 can't upgrade the firmware verson beginning with H1 or H3 -- the wrong upgrade will damage the router.&quot; I didn't want to try that on my router (which has firmware beginning with H1) for fear of bricking it. If you could post the version of firmware your router was using prior to the upgrade, that would be great. If I can actually go from H1_V3.3.6g_EN to 3.2.4.02s_EN, that would likely solve the issue.

Unfortunately, the post from GreyWanderingRogue has a link to www.strayed.co.uk which cannot be reached. What do you set your repeater's SSID as? Does it have to be the same as the primary router? What about IP address for secondary? Should I change it to something different from primary? Please suggest. Also do I disable DHCP on secondary? Do I have to enter the MAC of secondary in the primary? If so where? Any help will be much appreciated as I have spent a couple of weekends doing this without success. Thanks in advance

Last but not least setup the same bat channels as above (although this is the last change to make... then it will stop working... unplug and replug and voila it works!) One can this way, if you are close the the first router, connect to it securely or closer to the second router, connect to it securely... Awesome. At my mom's house I can use the second router from the ground floor, while that router is in the 10th floor... I would love to be able to do this with the (actually two) W268R I just bought but it's refusing to flash to the lower firmware version known to allow WDS mode (also the very reason for buying the router). What's up Tenda? If it's not broken don't fix it... Looking for clever workarounds to the firmware dilemma. Also I believe I have the Ralink chipset not the Broadcom... Additionally Jimmy I have found no downloads for the firmware versions you mentioned initially in your post. Help?

There are at least two versions of this router (I own two). On the outside, one has a reset button next to the wps/wlan button which is accessible with a paper clip. The other has no such reset button (but it does still have a wps/wlan button). Router 1: This is the router with a reset button. In the system status page, it reports itself as anything between hardware version 0.65 and 2.0. Nonsensically, the hardware version it reports depends on the firmware installed. Mine shipped with the V3.3.6g firmware which reports as hardware version 2.0. Router 2: This is the router with no reset button. In the system status page, it reports itself as hardware version 3.0. I do not know if that changes with firmware version as I did not change the firmware on this router (it shipped with V5.07.25) As shipped, these would not connect via WDS. I tried downgrading the firmware of router 1 to V3.2.5e, however, I experienced the same difficulties as mentioned above where the downgrade would not 'take'. After downgrading, the firmware still reported V3.3.6g and WDS still didn't work. However, after much experimentation, I found that I could get WDS working after following this firmware upgdrade/downgrade path on router 1: V3.3.6g to V3.3.6h V3.3.6g to V3.2.4.02s At that point, I attempted to upgrade to V3.2.5e, however, it gives an error saying that the firmware is too big. But, with V3.2.4.02s, it was able to connect to router 2 via WDS. Router 1 now reports itself as hardware version 0.65. Again, I did not change the firmware of router 2. Hope this helps!
