<s> Here is my issue. </s>
<s> I work in an I.T. </s>
<s> office but our wireless guy left and we havent gotten a replacement yet. </s>
<s> This is probably a simple question but I have Googled it and cant find the answer. </s>
<s> I have a few doctors that when they take their laptops home and connect wirelessly, the laptop will not find our work wireless when they come back. </s>
<s> We are running Vista Business with Cisco G wireless. </s>
<s> Any basic troubleshooting tips would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dean </s>
<s> Is SSID turned on at work? </s>
<s> It's about half way down the page but you can google the setting I'm changing to get Vista to connect. </s>
<s> Here's the words -&gt; VISTA BROADCAST FLAG. </s>
<s> Sure you can argue that it connects at home. </s>
<s> All that will do is have me tell you to replace your wifi router, WAP or upgrade the firmware on the WAPs. </s>
<s> BTDT, hope you fix it fast now. </s>
