I know I know.
Backup backup backup.
To be honest, probably 1/4 of the pics are backed up on my PS3 and ofcourse I was meaning to finish them.....
But this morning I tried something for the hell of it....and it worked!
I set the attributes of the whole drive to hidden and then changed it back.....VOILA!
There was my name, with all the subfolders inside.
Weird.
Thanks for all the replies....guess you know what I will be doing this weekend.
