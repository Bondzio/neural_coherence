Both the power supply and mother board check out ok. Now the problem seems to be between the on/off button to the mother board. Is there a way to check for this or get around it? Where would I be able to fine a replacement if needed? I have check ebay (can replace the whole case) but nothing. Dell customer service takes to long and will charge a fee just to tell me that I should send it in. Any help will do thanks.

The power switch is a momentarty push switch. The easest way to check this out is to CAREFULLY short out the pins on the MB whet the power button plugs into. If it powers up then the switch is bad. then you can have fun getting a replacement from DEll. Or juryrig a small switch. John

I will check the switch myself and you are right about getting anything from dell. Ebay has a case and power supply for $50 that I am looking into. Have you heard of just removing the battery for a few minutes so the computer can reset?
