<s> Hi, We are looking to buy a new desktop urgently. </s>
<s> We use our PC for internet browsing, email, photos, watching videos/movies/live streams and Word, Excel, PP etc. </s>
<s> We are not technical people at all so are unable to for example, build our own PC or even install Windows by ourselves. </s>
<s> We recently moved to Paris so we don't know any local recommended shops who can build a PC for us. </s>
<s> It also seems uncommon here in France to find a PC with an English operating system. </s>
<s> We want a PC were the menus and dialogue boxes are in English, but that supports other languages that we use (incl. </s>
<s> French, *** and Hebrew). </s>
<s> Is Windows Pro the right choice for us? </s>
<s> This is what we were offered today in one shop. </s>
<s> If anyone has any advice on shopping for a desktop in Paris and/or in general what brand/specifications to look for and where we can find reasonable prices, kindly let me know. </s>
<s> Many thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The hardware shouldn't be a problem. </s>
<s> Your requirements are only moderate, so practically everything new would be fine. </s>
<s> Finding an English language OS might be difficult on a prepackaged system. </s>
<s> I just tried www.dell.fr and on the model I chose, they only offered the French version of Windows 7. </s>
<s> So you need to find a shop that can order and install the USA version on a custom built system, without having to pay twice for a license. </s>
<s> I'm sure they exist, but I don't live in France, let alone in Paris, so I can't advise you. </s>
<s> A very important detail is the choice of the keyboard. </s>
<s> In France, normally, they use the French keyboard, that is optimized for typing all those accents (like in ). </s>
<s> But the lay-out is different from the standard USA- or UK-keyboard you're used to. </s>
<s> And, as far as I remember, it's AZERTY in stead of QUERTY. </s>
<s> Gone are your typing skills. </s>
<s> So even with all that French accents, you might prefer a US- or UK-keyboard (even those are different). </s>
<s> What other languages are supported by the various applications you install on the machine, is dependent on the application and not on the language of the OS. </s>
<s> You can install the US version of MS Word with a French dictionary on either a French or an English version of Windows. </s>
<s> Finally, Windows 7 Home Premium is fine for you. </s>
<s> No need to pay more for the Pro version. </s>
<s> With Dell &quot;Windows 7 Professionel&quot; is an extra 50 euro compared with the standard &quot;Windows 7 dition Familiale Premium&quot; (the French version you don't want). </s>
<s> The difference in another shop should be comparable. </s>
<s> Best of luck with your new machine. </s>
<s> And a happy stay in Paris, of course! </s>

<s> I typed phonetically. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Kees, Many thanks for the reply! </s>
<s> yes, we plan to purchase an English (US I guess) keyboard. </s>
<s> We found this French page with some computers with the English version of Windows 7 (some are Vista but we don't want that): http://www.pixmania.com/fr/fr/19330/xx/xx/105/9/criteresn.html?s=19330&m=xx&t=xx&categorieid=9&cat=105&startrow=&sortBy=ASC&orderBy=Prix The one that caught our attention is: COMPAQ SG3-110UK (version anglaise) for 349 euro What do you think about this one or is there any other on that page you would go for? </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> Nothing wrong with that Compaq, I think; I looked at the &quot;fiche technique&quot; (technical specs). </s>
<s> It's not the latest of the latest or the hottest of the hottest, but it's all you need. </s>
<s> And pixmania.com is a trusted address to buy from here in Western Europe, No need to hesitate. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Personally, I don't see why most people who buy desktops, don't buy laptops. </s>
<s> With the advances in HDTV's these days, why not buy a laptop, hook it up to your TV, get a wireless keyboard and mouse, and use the TV as your main monitor? </s>
<s> The advantage to this is the portability of the laptop. </s>
<s> If someone want to watch TV while you are using the computer, you can take it into another room (or use it on the couch). </s>
<s> When you need mobility, say on vacation or such, you can take a laptop right along with you. </s>
<s> An advantage of having it hooked up to your TV is that you can stream movies from anywhere on the net or watch things like Youtube. </s>
<s> As far as which computer is right for you, that would be totally dependent on your price range and intended use. </s>
