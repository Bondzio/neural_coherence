i'm having a very similar problem, except i'm using adsl.
i've enabled connection bridging so that i can launch a seperate connection to dial into my office network.
now, everytime i start-up my computer, it's still automatically connected, and neither one of my connection icons are available.
this only happens on occasion, and normally fixes itself when i restart my computer, but i've done that 3 times already, and my icons are still not there.
if anyone has a clue, please help.
i can't currently get into my office network.
os: ms windows xp pro sp2 modem: adsl wi fi thanks
