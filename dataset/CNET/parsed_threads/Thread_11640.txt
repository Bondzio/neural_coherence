<s> Hi, I'm hoping that you guys can help me sort out a problem that is literally doing my head in!!! </s>
<s> Apologies in advance for being a complete novice, so if what I say doesn't make sense, then just let me know!! </s>
<s> I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 1200 laptop, which I connect to the internet via a wireless connection. </s>
<s> I bought with my laptop, a dell 2350 (number may be slightly wrong) router which is connected to my desktop pc. </s>
<s> The modem that I was using prior to having the laptop, was was incompatible with the router as it was a USB connection, so I have also bought a netgear modem. </s>
<s> The laptop has a belkin network card. </s>
<s> My problem is that I can access the internet using the wireless connection, but the connection keeps dropping, often as much as every few minutes Being the complete novice that I am, the only way I canget back online, is to disconnect and reconnect the power lead on the modem!!! </s>
<s> When the connection drops it loses the connection on both the desktop and laptop. </s>
<s> Its getting to the point where it is impossible todo anything online, because I can often only look at one page before losing the connection. </s>
<s> I don't understand at all how the router works, so haven't a clue if there is a problem with the settings that is causing this. </s>
<s> can anyone advise what I can do???? </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> Make sure the router's firmware is the latest. </s>

<s> In addition to making sure everything is updated, a common factor is other items sharing the air waves. </s>
<s> Do you have a wireless phone? </s>
<s> Often times when they broadcast, the wireless connection is terminated. </s>
