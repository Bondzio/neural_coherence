I was useing a DVI-D cable but switched out computers. Now i have the Dell and im useing a VGA cable but it says i have no signal. I most likely need to change the input to VGA but i dont know how. The few buttons that are on my monitor dont do anything cuz i have no signal. Any suggestions

The second hit was http://support.acer.com/product/default.aspx?modelId=834 Clicking on the FAQ (frequently asked questions) on the top tab bar I see this. &quot;How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor?&quot; Acer writes there: http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14950 &quot;How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor? How do I switch between the VGA and DVI input signals on my monitor? If you have one or more devices connected to your monitor you can switch between the VGA and DVI input signals. To switch between the VGA and DVI input signals follow the steps below: On the lower bezel of your monitor, press the MENU button to enter the onscreen menu. Use the arrow buttons to navigate to the Image icon and press the MENU button to enter the submenu. Select the input signal and press the MENU button to confirm. Use the arrow buttons to navigate to the EXIT icon, and then press the MENU button to save and exit. &quot; There is a graphic icon there I can't put in this forum. Bob

This is what I see in the submenu: 1680x1050 H: 64KHz V: 60HZ Digital Input then my S/N # - I even tried switching the Digital Input to Analog which did nothing.

I double cheked and I followed the steps the right way this time, and I entered the submenu and switched the input from digital to analog and the screen goes black for about 2sec and then goes right back to digital. Almost as if i dont have an AVG cable connected. Any ideas?
