I need to upgrade my motherboard, CPU, and RAM, there are SO many to choose from i feel lost.
My current system (For GAMING only) Windows 7 pro 64-bit Unknown motherboard (2 pci-e slots, 2 DDR2 slots, AM3 socket, built in sound, 4 USB 2.0 slots) AMD Phenom II Quad Core 2.4 ghz Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 1gb 4 GB DDR2 RAM Corsair 750w PSU cd/dvd drive 500 gb hard drive I am going to buy a new case, thinking about a full tower, and i want a new motherboard, CPU and RAM, keeping my graphics, psu, HD, and dvd drive My budget is $250-$300 for the motherboard and CPU, i have no preference between Intel or AMD I dont know much about CPUs as far as which is best, how many cores is optimal etc.
Thanks
