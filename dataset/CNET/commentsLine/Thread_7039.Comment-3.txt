...and just a search away too.
search : abit av8  listed specification shows support for an agp 4x/8x complaint graphics card, and athlon 64 x2 cpu.
x1300 comparison :  places it right at the bottom in almost every game, but as long as the &quot;few&quot; games&quot; are at low res, low aa/af, and a few years old..it might (just) scrape through.
ati x1600/ nv 6600gt offer far more power (and longer game lifespan) for a little extra outlay.
good luck, geebee.
