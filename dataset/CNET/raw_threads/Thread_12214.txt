My Linksys WRT54G v5 is a dog -- stops working, needs to be rebooted almost daily. I've read the reviews (and this forum) and I know I'm not the only person with this problem. It's lousy equipment, I want to replace it, and I won't be buying Linksys again. So -- can anyone recommend an affordable (&lt;$100) home wireless router? My criteria are, in this order, 1) RELIABLE (day in, day out, never needs attention); 2) FAST; and 3) EASY to set up and maintain. I don't need any high-end features -- just an internet access point with WPA+ encryption. Thanks for your help. I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs.

If your looking at $100 routers then you probably can't produce enough bandwidth to actually use a line speed router. Second...It needs to be rebooted daily? I've used nothing but modified linksys routers for my company of 100+ people and its the only thing I don't have to worry about. ''Thanks for your help. I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs.'' (Right....) ''Easy to setup.'' What easier than plugging it in? Do a little research. Walk though Best Buy. Don't trash a good product, maybe you should talk to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).

I have a mac ibook, but my friends come over with there peecees and they have never had trouble connecting. If you don't want an open network, very easy to close it up too. That is all I have to say, hope is helps.

All of them seem, from my vantage point, to work as advertised. As such, when someone asks me which one, I tell them to buy which ever is on sale that week and I'll help them get it up and running. Following Bob's advice about upgrading the firmware has resolved almost every issue I have come across, except the occasional &quot;doa&quot; that can happen to any vendor.

One of your responses reminded to check my firmware, and I did -- sure enough, Linksys had posted an update on 9/22. I updated and, to their slight credit, the worst of the problem has ended -- I have not had to re-boot the router since I updated. HOWEVER, Linksys isn't free and clear -- this was the third or fourth firmware update I've installed since I've had the router, none of which solved the problem I described in my original post; AND the darn thing is still buggy -- sometimes I have to try several times in order to establish a connection. If I take the router out of the loop, the problem is gone. Linksys still has some 'splainin to do. Thanks gang for the suggestions.

If you are having problems you may want to try a simple flush. Open the command prompt and enter: ipconfig /flushdns. This may clear some old stuff in the cache.

In all the crap that I put it through, even with self-inflicted errors what I would get when I 'tweak' it, it still runs like a charm. I will admit, there are times when I flash to new BIOS, the router would crap out. I simply re-flash it to it's origional state, and works like a charm agian. Added Hi-Gain antennas when I get crappy signals, and it works even better than I thought. If you are still experiencing internet issues, you may want to try the hi-gain antenna option. Assuming all else fails. Good luck

The problem that sticks in my craw is that the logging/emailing function is not operational. This thing does not log at all. My old 614 did it flawlessly. I spent three months trying to work with Netgear support only to find out about a class action lawsuit against them. They offered me $10 off my next online purchase through them. I also bought their MP101 to wirelessly stream music. It looks pretty there gathering dust. It has never worked although I think it is the server software. I have negative feelings about a company that their gear fails out of the box.

However, the 634M is much faster, with MIMO and a greater range. I've had it for at least three months, and I may have rebooted it once since getting it set up originally. Both were easy to configure with a reasonably simple &quot;G&quot; home network.

After several weeks, and no resolution from Verizon, and a ton of frustration, called LinkSys Tech Support. Result, return unit (defective) for exchange. With the exchanged unit, setup ran smoothly and without any problem. No problems since. Regardless of the brand, anything can fail out of the box, or have problems. The model Linksys I have is the SpeedBoost model. I turn mine off daily after use, as well as the computer.

I added a Belkin Wireless Access Point and I've had not a single problem. The interface to the AP control panel is a bit clunky but it does the job. I've had Belkin kit for other projects in the past and never had a problem with any of it. It's cheap too - at least here in the UK! Good luck. Z

Searched through the web for solution and found that its better to update the linksys firmware to a Linux DDWRT. Am now a very happy owner of the router.

You should note that this is a VERY common problem with v5 of the firmware for this router. Linksys does not deserve your business if they allow such ridiculously lousy firmware to become public without the proper testing. Check Wikipedia if you don't believe me.
