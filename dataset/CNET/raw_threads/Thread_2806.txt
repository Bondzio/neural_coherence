I've tried a new cooler (Corsair H70), it's def not a CPU cooling issue. I've tried clocking it down to standard (2.8 from 3.6), still shuts down. It'll do games and burn in tests etc without problems, then when its not doing anything, it'll shut down! Any ideas folks? Any help will be very gratefully received. Cheers Smifo
