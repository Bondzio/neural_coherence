and i bought a tandy that actually had a hard drive, which i guess not every computer had in those days!
i really loved the deskmate software.
it was easier to use than dos and the early version od windows; however, they had knowledge that windows was on it's way - when i inset\rted a disk with a microsoft program, i got a message saying something like: this product is not equipped for windows.
