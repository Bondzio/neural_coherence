i am looking to collect some ideas before plopping down a large amount of money for a machine that can keep up with my graphics work.
i work in publishing and i use applications like adobe indesign, photoshop, and illustrator often.
i find that i need to run at least two of these applications simultaneously along with the standard outlook and internet explorer.
at times, my system slows to a crawl (p4 2.8, 768mb ram, 128 nvidia ti4200, 50gb hd).
what suggestions would you make to help me modify this?
i have tinkered with the idea of dual processors but then there is the p4 extreme edition.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
robert
