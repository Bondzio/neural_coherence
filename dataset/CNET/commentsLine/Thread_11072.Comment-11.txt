as your mobo can handle the prescott consider that it would be best to consider a bigger psu if you indeed only have the 250w.
also be aware that the p4 prescott runs a bit hotter than the celeron so you might also consider upgrading your hsf.
a good copper core hsf would be well worth the small investment.
don't forget the thermal grease.
as mentioned before, it is not optional.
this is a pretty good combination.
good luck.
