Well!
My flash drive of 2GB stopped writing at under 1GB and I got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet.
In the end I started the PC in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it.
It started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message.
Having restarted the PC normally I right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally.
Problem solved I hope!!
