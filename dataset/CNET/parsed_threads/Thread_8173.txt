<s> Hey guys Our company is starting a new project and our clients will be going digital with their records. </s>
<s> They will have 24 iPADS that their clients/customers will be using. </s>
<s> My question is -- what is the best security out there (software and hardware) for the iPAD. </s>
<s> IE - if it is physically stolen. </s>
<s> I have heard of MobileMe and GadgetTrak. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of anything better or recommend one over the other? </s>
<s> Our main goal is to make sure they aren't physically stolen (if they are we would like to have gps capabilities - like MobileMe). </s>
<s> The iPADS will be moving around alot so they can't be stationary (no chains, wires, etc to hold it down). </s>
<s> Thank in advance for your help </s>
<s> Each security software company should answer that question or you should remove them from your list. </s>
<s> BUT I too am looking at pads for a new system. </s>
<s> However we need Bluetooth SPP (you can google that) so we are looking at the new and arriving Android pads. </s>
<s> These are showing up at a much lower price. </s>
<s> Even the fully loaded 10 inch is 399 with the next wave looking to fall to 199 bucks. </s>
<s> Any reason to stick with the iPad? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Will still not stop them taking the info, all they have to do is turn off the GPS, delete the app or use a faraday cage. </s>
<s> You want too set the password lock on the units & look into something like DataVault, also do not let the users use any IM, there are backdoors hacks for the iPad using IM. </s>
<s> In the end the safest thing is never put very important info on any networked computer or a computer that can be taken home/out of office. </s>
<s> hey, I just randomely came across your post, the company I work for actually has a product for Ipad security management. </s>
<s> It's a console that enables company to centrally manage its mobile devices. </s>
<s> So you can use it to wipe your iPad remotely to protect company's confidential data. </s>
<s> And it's quite flexible in scales, so does suit varied company size. </s>
<s> There's a brief introduction on our website: (the product is iPhortress) http://www.mobiquant.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=2&Itemid=3 Please email me if you are interested to know more, please contact me (email shan.liu@mobiquant.com), will be very happy to give more information! </s>
