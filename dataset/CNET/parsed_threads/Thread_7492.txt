<s> I wanted to learn more about the insides of a computer so i ordered an Emachines W3609 that seemed upgradable. </s>
<s> I already installed additional ram 1.5 gb..and a wireless adapter sucessfully. </s>
<s> my question is can I install a SATA DVD burner (there are 3 unused SATA ports) instead of an IDE (like the existing one) to avoid the whole master/slave issue of sharing the one IDE port...and is SATA plug and play or will i have to get into the BIOS and other settings that I don't yet understand...thanks in advance. </s>
<s> No OS noted so my advice is to plug it all in and go for it. </s>
<s> See what happens. </s>
<s> Some are thinking we'll know the future. </s>
<s> The light in my crystal ball didn't show a flicker because all the clues are unknown (the words in red were unheeded.) </s>
