<s> I recently hooked up an external monitor to my ASUS laptop (running Windows 7) and it's now going to sleep at times as I'm working on Word, viewing a video, or without me doing anything. </s>
<s> I've changed the power settings, had the PC checked out at the shop, switched out the monitor and the power chord, and it will still go to sleep. </s>
<s> It usually does it with several programs running (Quickbooks, Firefox, Word, Outlook, Itunes) at a time and late at night after it's been running all day. </s>
<s> It often does it when I'm streaming video. </s>
<s> I added RAM to it and that didn't help either. </s>
<s> (It never goes to sleep like this if I'm using the laptop's monitor only.) </s>
<s> Here are its specs: The chip type: Mobile Intel (R) 4 series Express Chipset family Adapter string: Mobile Intel (R) GMA 4500 M Total available graphics memory: 1326 MB Dedicated Video memory: 64 MB System video memory: 0 MB Shared system memory: 1262 MB Last night just before it went to sleep I noticed I could hear the fan running and it sounded like it was working pretty hard. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I can't find the exact model but I'm finding many folk reporting &quot;it's going to sleep&quot; because the monitor shows such a message. </s>
<s> What's really happening is the laptop shut down and the monitor shows a &quot;going to sleep&quot; message so let's move on. </s>
<s> Given the GMA I have to guess the age but let's check if you are using the canned air to clean every few months. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply, but I've tried the canned air inside the laptop and the PC still goes to sleep, usually after I start streaming video. </s>
<s> And I'm definitely sure it's just going to sleep and not powering down. </s>
<s> I just hit the enter key to bring it back to life. </s>

<s> Given the claims above I'd have to see the unit. </s>
<s> I'd be checking all the sleep settings from BIOS or OS. </s>
