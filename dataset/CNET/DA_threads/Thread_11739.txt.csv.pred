1.1.1	Last night I went to download the update for WoW .	St
1.1.2	Anyway , my hard drive and fan seemed to be spinning very high .	St
1.1.3	Towards the end of the download , I heard a & quot ; whirring & quot ; or & quot ; whistling & quot ; sound , which sort of faded in , got a little loud , and then faded out .	St
1.1.4	It did it about 3 different times , but has n't done it since .	St
1.1.5	Is this an indication that something is wrong with my hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.6	Or could it have been the cooling fan ?	Ques
1.1.7	My first hard drive that crashed would give me a clicking sound , but this was a high-pitched whirr or whistle .	St
1.1.8	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	You need to remove side cover of system case and follow your ear .	St
1.2.2	Locate the source and proceed from there .	St
1.2.3	Fans typically are the source of much noise or new source of noise as they fail .	St
1.2.4	Observe the fans ( any fan ) for inbtermit operation .	St
1.2.5	A good cleaning helps as always if not done in awhile .	St
1.2.6	For the most part , HD omit a constant noise or lack of one ( very quiet ) , so do n't jump too quickly on a failing HD , but if apparent *backup* as a safety precaution ASAP , regardless .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Maybe , drive is about to go !	St
