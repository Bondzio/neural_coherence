1.1.1	I have been looking into moving my hard drive from my computer to my network.	St
1.1.2	I am also in the market to purchase a new router.	St
1.1.3	I am trying to decide if I should purchase a router with a usb port or a separate storage device for my network.	St
1.1.4	I don't want to spend too much since all the NAS devices I have found are at least $200, but I have read bad reviews about accessing data through a routers usb port.	St
1.1.5	Thoughts?	St
1.2.1	I find most try this and immediately return the HDD back to the USB or other port on the PC.	St
1.2.2	The reason is that almost every time the drop in speed has the owner fuming.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	That was my big concern.	St
1.3.2	I was not sure about the reliability of setting up a system like this.	St
1.3.3	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	I find most NAS to be reliable because folk don't move the units around.	St
1.4.2	The most common reliability issue with external drives is that they are dropped.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Is there a brand or specific product that you would recommend?	St
1.6.1	As a NAS is all over the map with some offering features that some would demand and others will not, it's a shop, shop, shop till you find the unit that fills the bill.	St
