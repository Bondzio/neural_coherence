PC2700 runs slower than PC3200, but since you already have a PC2700 stick it doesn't matter which you choose as it would be forced to run at the slower PC2700 speed.
As far as price is concerned, that varies.
There are frequently sales that make PC3200 cheaper than PC2700 or vice versa, so just shop around for both and snag the best deal.
