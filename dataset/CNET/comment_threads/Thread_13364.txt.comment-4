&quot;I've only tried a combination of PCI cards and I thought this should work because I know others who have used a setup like what Im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?&quot; Yes.
I did have a few dual PCI card setups.
All were combos like a pair of ATI cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of Matrox Millenium cards.
Been there, done that.
It's all in the cards and drivers.
