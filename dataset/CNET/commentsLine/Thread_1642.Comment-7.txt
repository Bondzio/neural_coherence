in order to determine what the best computer would be for your money, we have to know what types of things you do with your computer.
are you a gamer, or like to edit photos or videos, or do you just run home office type apps?
a good local system builder could help you determine exactly what your needs are and design a system to meet your needs.
i.e., if you don't need high end graphics, and an on-board video chip would suffice, you could spend the extra money on memory, hard drive or faster cpu.
spending extra on memory is better than pinching your budget on memory for a faster cpu.
just a few thoughts, hope this helps.
