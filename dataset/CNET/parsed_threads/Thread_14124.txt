<s> I am researching components in while I save up for my first PC build. </s>
<s> The goal is to build a budget/low end HTPC. </s>
<s> I don't know if I have a need for an HTPC and really just want to do the build for fun/curiosity. </s>
<s> It may end up as a general purpose desktop when it is all said and done. </s>
<s> What would be desirable specs for a processor in a build like this?&lt;div&gt; I sifted through processors on Newegg and made a list of processors with 65W or less, most current sockets, and $100 or less with up to $125 as a grey zone. </s>
<s> This leaves the Celeron G530/540, Pentium G600 &amp; G800 series, Athlon II X2 series &amp; X3 400e series, AMD A4 APUs and the A6 3500 APU. </s>
<s> The i3-2100 is in the grey zone. </s>
<s> I currently am leaning toward the A6-3500. </s>
<s> Are there any big downsides to going with it vs an Athlon II X2/X3, Pentium G800 series, or i3 2100?&lt;div&gt; I purposely left out discussing form factor to keep this post shorter. </s>
<s> I plan on starting a thread when I look into motherboards. </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> I wanted to mention, my second choice right now is the Athlon II X2 250. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if a discrete graphics card would be needed with something like this, though. </s>
<s> One has to know if it will be transcoding content on the fly. </s>
<s> If so, you need about double that for CPU power. </s>
<s> If it's just to play content on some HDMI 1080 display, then pair up any CPU you listed with the fanless ATI 5450 card and you are there. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply, Bob. </s>
<s> You'll have to forgive me, I am new to some of these terms. </s>
<s> They way I understand it, transcoding on the fly would be taking a video file saved as one format and convert it to a different format so that a certain program can display it all while the program is playing the video and the file would not be resaved in the new format? </s>
<s> Would transcoding not on the fly then be converting the file to a different format, saving it, and then playing the newly saved file? </s>
<s> Is it common to need to transcode on the fly? </s>
<s> Wouldn't you be able to get around this need by choosing a program that could display the original format? </s>
<s> I think I would mostly use the machine for streaming HD video and playing saved DVD/BluRay content. </s>
<s> It would be unlikely, at least early on to transcode on the fly. </s>
<s> If I get into it that much, I would likely just look into building a new machine. </s>
<s> Final question: What level of processor would do away with the need for a discrete graphics card for 1080p viewing? </s>
<s> I was under the impression they were not needed with any A series APU. </s>
<s> I'm not against a discrete card, just trying to get a feel for cost/benefit. </s>
<s> Thanks Dylan </s>
<s> Because you would be the one creating or supplying the content. </s>
<s> As to streaming, if the file is to be streamed, then we don't need that powerful card or CPU. </s>
<s> We're moving bytes down the pipe and not much else. </s>
<s> I think the CPU and the 5450 would be a great solution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I am sure I will have many more questions. </s>
