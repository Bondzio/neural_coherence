At my workplace, we use the Netgear 814MR router, so I already have the appropriate wireless card for my laptop.
I just moved into a new apartment, and I bought my own 814MR router, as my plan is to set up a wireless network there using the same security configurations (server name, encryption key, etc) as are in place at my office so that my connection settings will never have to be changed.
With the router in my possession, and a working DSL connection in my apartment, what order of steps should I follow to get my home network up and running?
Specifically, if step A is installing router software on my computer, step B is downloading upgrades/patches from the Netgear website, step C is physically connecting my router to my internet connection, and step D might be a step that I am not aware of, in what order should steps A-D(or others) go?
Thanks for your help.
