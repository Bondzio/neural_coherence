1460	0	260389	2562775	NR	The Crook	8/14/07 1:08 PM	1.18709688E12	Is this video card compatible?	So I was helping a friend of mine get a computer and we found this computer( http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3231140&CatId=2629 ) and this video card( http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2568900&CatId=1826 ) I know they are both PCI Express but just to make sure did I miss something, or is the card compatible with the computer? I'm pretty sure that everything will go together, but if anything goes wrong it all gets blamed on me.
