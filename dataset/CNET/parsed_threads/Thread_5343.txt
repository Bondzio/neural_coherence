<s> Hi, I can't seem to figure this one out. </s>
<s> PC specs: Asus P4S800 motherboard Pentium 4 2.8Ghz 512MB DDR Memory I don't think anything else is relevant. </s>
<s> It was a barebones kit. </s>
<s> I put everything together back in april I think and everything was working fine. </s>
<s> I haven't experienced any problems until recently. </s>
<s> Suddenly one day the computer would not boot. </s>
<s> I would turn it on and it would power up but nothing happened. </s>
<s> No beep, it would just hang. </s>
<s> So, I opened it up and started disconecting parts(HD, CD drives, etc) one by one. </s>
<s> No change. </s>
<s> Then I started to check connections on everything else(video card, memory, etc) and nothing. </s>
<s> Now for the part that really confusses me. </s>
<s> I unlocked the CPU fan to try to take it off. </s>
<s> I had difficulty getting it off so I decided to give up, reattached the fan and just for kicks turned it on. </s>
<s> It booted and went straight to system BIOS with a message next to CPU external frequency(i think). </s>
<s> It said something about the setting being too high. </s>
<s> I think it was at something like 200/33. </s>
<s> I could be wrong about that value. </s>
<s> I have it written down somewhere. </s>
<s> Anyway there wasn't a lower setting. </s>
<s> So I left it alone and exited for the BIOS and let the PC boot. </s>
<s> After this, anytime I wanted to use my computer I would have to unlock the CPU fan, lock it again then boot. </s>
<s> Otherwise the system would just hang without booting. </s>
<s> Also, the computer would freeze if I had it on for too long. </s>
<s> Now it will not boot no matter what I do. </s>
<s> Could this be a problem with the power supply unit? </s>
<s> I thought it might be the processor overheating maybe. </s>
<s> I am really lost here and hope someone might be able to help. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> hear much more details about this locking / unlocking of the HSF. </s>
<s> Describe exactly what you are &quot;unlocking&quot; and why you can't get the fan off. </s>
<s> Separating the HSF combo from the CPU should be simple, the heat sink compound may cause them to stick together a little but should still be easy to separate. </s>
<s> Also it is a combination of a heatsink and a fan. </s>
<s> Are you trying to remove the fan from the heat sink???? </s>
<s> Any chance that you are unlocking the ZIF connector lever??? </s>
<s> [zero insertion force] that allows the CPU to be put in or removed without any insertion force?? </s>
<s> Had a case in the forums where someone was doing that and caused the CPU contacts to get burned due to poor contact because the lever was not locked. </s>
<s> Well this is going a little beyond my knowledge. </s>
<s> I have been learning alot as a result of this problem which is great. </s>
<s> Anyway I probably could have gotten the fan off but I really didn't know what I was doing and was afraid of accidentally damaging something. </s>
<s> There are two levers that lock the fan in place atop the heatsink. </s>
<s> All I did was open the levers, found the the fan came loose but did not come right off and because I didn't know what I was doing I locked the fan back in place and tried to boot up. </s>
<s> Even if I did something wrong at that stage it wouldn't explain the initial problem. </s>
<s> Although it might have made matters worse. </s>
<s> I do not think that is the case. </s>
<s> I was trying to be very carefull. </s>
<s> As for the ZIF connector lever, I am not sure what this looks like. </s>
<s> The levers I was touching were about 1.5 inches in length, laying horizontally, one the top and one on the bottom of the heatsink(at least I think they were connected to the heatsink). </s>
<s> Up until about a week ago I had no idea what a heatsink was. </s>
<s> My guess is that you are describing a Pentium 4 fan and heat sink. </s>
<s> After you loosen the leavers the metal clips have to be moved to remove the fan and heat sink. </s>
