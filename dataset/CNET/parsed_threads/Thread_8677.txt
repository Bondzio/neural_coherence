<s> I brought back a stick of 256MB PC133 SDRAM to Future Shop for an exchange (since my motherboard wasn't detecting it and the AzenRAM website stated it should). </s>
<s> Upon returning it, there were two girls there. </s>
<s> I told them it was defective. </s>
<s> One of them said: &quot;It probably got scanned by a barcode scanner. </s>
<s> They make these things defective.&quot; The other said that wasn't true but the girl seemed pretty sure about it. </s>
<s> Now I don't know what kind of merit this has, but I was wondering since it would explain why I've gotten two different sticks of AzenRAM that don't work. </s>
<s> (The second one was scanned despite the other girl's warning.) </s>
<s> So I don't know. </s>
<s> What do you guys think? </s>
<s> Is the barcode scanner really messing up the RAM? </s>
<s> My thinking is...BULL. </s>
