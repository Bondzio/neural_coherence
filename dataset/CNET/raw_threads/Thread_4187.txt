Having moved from the US to UK we forgot to flick the switch on the back of our Dell Inspiron desktop (basic 2004 model) from 115v to 230v! We knew it had to be done but somehow in the confusion of looking for a plug adaptor it got plugged in! There was a loud bang and a smell of burnt components!. Can I assume the computer is now only worthy of the bin, ie. will there be damage to other more expensive components than just the PSU? Is it possible or economically worth an amateur attempting to replace the PSU in case it is just the PSU? Any help greatly appreciated
