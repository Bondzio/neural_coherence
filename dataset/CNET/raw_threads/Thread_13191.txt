Does anyone have any experience with it ? Also, how would I capture the sound from the VHS ? The only sound output is an RCA jack. Thank you.

I used the ATI and Hauppauge cards for the CAPTURE step with the AUDIO plugged into my PC's audio line-in jack. After the capture I used Ulead.com's (demos are there) for the video to DVD creation. The downside to this is that you can count on 6 to 10 hours of work for each 1 hour of DVD. Not that you sit there for each hour, but that's the usual time it takes for the PC. Bob

Is it possible that I could get you to duplicate yours for a fee? Please help me, all I want to do is copy some camcorder video to digital. jgreaves42@hotmail.com
