Something like a sound card must be left out for a future upgrade.
Right now there more important things in the budget of $1500 like RAM, optical drives, case, and the list goes on.
The X-Fi is a great sound card because I have it in my desktop and the games work on it like magic.
Sound is great........ but anyways leave the sound card out for now and later it can be a great addition to a pc.
