i noticed the screw up, but figured i'd answer it anyway.
i assume the question has to do with hard drives and my answer would be that maxtor has to be the worst.
i have had a couple of them.
one failed six months later; the other failed in less than a month.
i've always preferred either seagate (they've been around a long time and good experience) and western digital (good experience with them).
i have little experience with the others.
