i ran a defrag/optimizer on my second hard drive.
now i am getting a message that says that i might have some sort of failure.
i talked to the computer tech's and they said to unplug the second hard drive, restart the comp, and press f1 to enter the bios set-up, and reset the bios.
the problem is nothing happens when i press f1-f12.
is there any other means of resetting the bios?
