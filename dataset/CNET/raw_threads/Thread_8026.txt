I need to configure/setup the router without the internet. The setup CD seems to require internet access. Is there a way to connect my computer to the router without connecting to the internet? Thanks for any help!

Don't get confused by the way you address a router -- the setup pages are in firmware in the router -- not on the internet. Log in to your router via Internet Explorer (or similar) using its IP address -- usually 192.168.0.1 but see the manual for precise details of default IP address and Username Password for accessing interface pages.

Go Start, All Programs, Accessories, Command Prompt At the black and white screen type IPCONFIG /ALL this will show you the IP address of all connections including the gateway which whould be the address of the router. Failing that you could press reset button on router to get it to revert to factory default IP address -- but this may default all other settings in the router too.
