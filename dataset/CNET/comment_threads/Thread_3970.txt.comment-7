Research your GPU.

Locked pipes are sometimes present in 'baby-brothers' (next-to-the-top-of-the-line products) and product line 'refreshes' since they often use scaled back versions of the same GPUs.
For example, the X1800GTO (product line refresh) has locked pipes but it's the same GPU as an X1800XT.
Unlocking those pipes effetively turns a cheaper video card into its bigger brother.
Pipes are unlocked with a 'soft-mod' that usually consists of flashing your card's bios with either a bios from another card or a hacked bios.
A bad flash/bios can sometimes render a card useless, so watch the hardware sites and let others burn their fingers and figure out how to do it right before you jump into soft modding.
