here's an article about OC'ing a q6600.
with an asus p5k, the overclock to 3ghz is almost automatic.
the p5k reached a higher final OC than the 680i based xfx board and 680i board required more tweaking.
http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2007/07/25/overclocking_intel_core_2_quad_q6600/1 as for a cooler, if you don't plan on OC'ing agressively any good heatpipe unit will suffice.
if you don't OC at all, the intel stock cooler is fine.
