<s> When I bought my PC in May it played my DVD movies. </s>
<s> Then about 4 months later it stopped working. </s>
<s> Today I went round and round looking through the trouble shooting, Windows Media, Power DVD and LITE-ON (DVD RW Drive maker) and it seems the DVD decoder went 'POOF'. </s>
<s> I was at CyberLync (Power DVD) and Windows Media trying to update or find a decoder. </s>
<s> Graphics card; VisionTek ATI Radeon 1300 (Installed today) OS; Windows XP SP2 Media; Windows Media 10, Power DVD 5 DVD; LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1633S Windows Media Player only has the option for CD audio under &quot;Play DVD/CD&quot;. </s>
<s> Anyone have any idea where the decoder went? </s>
<s> Power DVD or &quot;other.&quot; Check you CD software collection. </s>

<s> Hi, I use Power DVD, it works well. </s>
<s> But probably you have some programs data lost or corrupt? </s>
<s> BTW, check the DVD drive, it can be broken. </s>
<s> The only CD that came with my eMachines T6212 is the Windows XP. </s>
<s> I had &quot;Interactual Player&quot; on here and that would not play either so I figured the drive was bad. </s>
<s> I forgot I bought a Geek Squad contract so I called them. </s>
<s> They had me uninstall the DVDRW drive in the device manager and restart my computer. </s>
<s> WinXP detected it and reinstalled the drivers and now it works. </s>
<s> Thank you for your input. </s>
