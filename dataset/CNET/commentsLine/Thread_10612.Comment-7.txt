in my mac network which should be the same as any 802.11g or n network i have an old airport snow router that i use as a slave to a new airport extreme---you simply configure the routers with the configuration tool.
you used to have to configure the remote node first as a slave endpoint (not a repeater as a repeater requires yet another end point router).
so then you have your main router---then you have the extending router some 60 feet away, if you have an 802.11g rouiter simply upgrading to 802.11n likelyu doubles your range but i still use an old 802.11g to serve my bedroom pc as its upstairs from my office 802.11g router and its better to dedicate that router to then tandem switch my data over to the 802.11n than contend with my daughter's and wife at night...keeps the airwaves segmented better and isolates any issues i have to the extending routers.
antennas?
well the fios 802.11n routers they give you are mega powerfuil and i do not use them as i don't like them as they don't autoconfigure with my mac wifi net as well so they blast wifi in my house and i should disable them as its not good for other wifi or anyone sitting near it who is male and under 35 planning to have children.
forget antennas.
go with a newer better updated front end router--some come with antennas if you don't want to go macintosh but imho mac is the bomb--its now idiot proof but was not for 8 years until now...
