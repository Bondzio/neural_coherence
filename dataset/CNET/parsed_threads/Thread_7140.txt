<s> I am in the market for a netbook for my nephew that's 10. </s>
<s> He's in 4th grade and is looking for a netbook for homework. </s>
<s> I don't want to get a notebook cause he's still young and dont think he will take care of it. </s>
<s> I am trying to get something that's 300 or less. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I went to Walmart and picked up a sub 300 netbook. </s>
<s> My nephew was thrilled. </s>

<s> Bob Can you kindly tell me what model you got from Walmart? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I bought my nephew the Emachine EM250-1162. </s>
<s> That's not the point here. </s>
<s> You need to see what is out there today and see what folk think. </s>
<s> That model may be out of stock or not at your local stores. </s>
<s> At the office we have a few too many netbooks. </s>
<s> They all perform about the same. </s>
<s> The lesson is simple. </s>
<s> One is much like the next. </s>
