<s> I recently bought a 20&quot; flat panel and I want to improve my video performance. </s>
<s> These are the specs on my PC: Pentium III 800 MHz 512 MB SDRAM 100 MHz NVidia GeForce DDR 64 MB AGP 1X/2X/4X Would I see any noticeable improvement if I just added a mid-level video card like the ATI Radeon 9600 128 MB w/ DVI out or would the CPU/RAM require upgrading as well? </s>
<s> Thanks is advance, P|&lt; </s>
<s> By video performance, do you mean gaming (I think not with a 800 mhz system)? </s>
<s> Upgrading a video card for better &quot;video-quality&quot; is almost useless, unless your current video card doesn't support your monitors' native resolution. </s>
<s> You may get more options such as brightness controls or such, but that won't warrent the money for a new card. </s>
<s> It's a marriage arrangement, that they have to be in par with each other for optimum output. </s>
<s> If you can find a Geforce with increased ram of 128 or better of the same type video card, that's your best chance. </s>
<s> YES, you will need to increase the system speed(cpu) to keep up with one of the newer cards. </s>
<s> However, you can throttle down a new video card with its setup s/w for a less demanding but certainly better than old output. </s>
<s> Check their support website for details. </s>
<s> Also, newer AGP video may outstrip(added connection) the power supply as now they require 30W+ where as older units are 20-25W range, take that into condiration. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Before I opened my wallet I would look into free stuff like finding the proper mobo and vid drivers that mated to the OS I was using and gave me the best perf. </s>
<s> Don't assume the newest drivers are best, you must test. </s>
<s> I don't know what type of vid perf your looking for but I suspect that 800cpu and 100memory are going to be a problem. </s>
