ok, so i have a hp with vista home premium, and i'm trying to record a bunch of lp's to digital.
the desktop has 2 l/r composite audio jacks(one in the front, one in the back).
i have searched everywhere trying to find out how to record through the composite jacks, but everything says to get an adapter and record through the 3.5mm jack.
but i don't really want to buy an adapter when there are already 2 composite jacks on the computer.
i don't know why they're on the computer if they don't have a purpose.
does anyone know how to access these ports for recording?
