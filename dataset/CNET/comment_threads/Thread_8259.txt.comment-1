I am setting up a small office ie.
4-5 workstations and wireless network.
I need to have printing capacity as well for all workstations.
I am wondering if it is better to buy smaller printers for each station or to network them all to one bigger printer.
Does anyone know how I could best research answers to this question?
thanks.
