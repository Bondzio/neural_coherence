Erased CD-RW with CDBurnerXP.
Put CD-RW in another computer running Win XP Pro.
Message: No CD in drive.
Put new CD-RW disc (from same box, but never formated as UDF) in drive and Windows has no problem recognizing it.
Windows XP will not recognize CD-RW with previous UDF format.
Am I missing something here?
