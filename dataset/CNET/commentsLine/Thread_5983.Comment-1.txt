i'll try my best to make sense of the situation.
i have a brother laser printer which i have connected to my router wirelessly, and a desktop connected to the same router via ethernet.
yet, when i go in windows to add a printer, it cannot find it.
i have the drivers installed, and it works via usb.
any advice?
thanks.
