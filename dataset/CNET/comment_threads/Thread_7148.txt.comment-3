One possible investment might be a battery backup/surge protector.
They have small enough batteries for them to be almost as big as a regular surge protector.
But with the added bonus of monitoring how much power your computer needs.
They have this so that they can calculate how long the battery will last before shutting down your computer.
Some of them will even shut down your computer automatically.
And with that software you can see for yourself what wattage your computer uses.
I guess theres those &quot;quality watts&quot; verses those &quot;cheap watts&quot;.
Unless your computer is crashing, I'd leave it be.
