I keep getting a timeout page every time I try to access a domain I recently purchased ( www.ledotax.com).
I assume that since the first time I tried to access the domain it was unresolved the router cache the domain as being unassigned and so this is a simple issue of clearing the DNS cache, but I cannot figure out how to clear it.
I have tried resetting to factory defaults, updating firmware, and telnetting into the router (which apparently is not an option with this router), I even tried using a hacked DI-624 firmware because it supposedly gives you more options in the control panel than the 524, but I still can't find anything useful.
Removing the the router and connecting directly to the modem yields no problems at all so I am positive the error lies with the router.
Below is my set-up.
Any help would be appreciated.
