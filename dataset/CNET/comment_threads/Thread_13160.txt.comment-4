I loved my old Brother laser printer -- I'd gotten used to it at work, and I could get high-yield house-brand toner cartridges for it pretty cheap from Quill (the other office-supply chains all seemed to carry house-brand toner for it, too).
I'm curious as to which Brother multifunction machine you got; my local Pamida store carries 2 different models (plus a current-model Brother monochrome personal laser printer).
None of the Brother printers are currently on sale at Pamida; however, since they usually put one printer on sale each week, I can get one locally at a decent price if I'm willing to wait.
(Maybe their price-matching policy would stretch to same-model printers on sale at those out-of-town office supply chain stores, too!)
I'd like to match the scanner size of my current standalone scanner (the Epson 3490 scans originals up to 8.5&quot;x14&quot;); I also like the idea of having separate cyan/magenta/yellow cartridges instead of a single multicolor cartridge (sounds less wasteful that way).
It sounds like you got a &quot;tabloid-size&quot; multifunction machine; where did you get it, and how much did it cost?
