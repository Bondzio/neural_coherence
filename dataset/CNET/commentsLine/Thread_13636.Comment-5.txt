hi, i have had similiar problem with my pc but mine is hard wired connecting with a netgear router.i tried everything you can think of,new nic,replaced cables,anti virus/spyware scans in safe mode, including re-installing the op system xp pro and after 6 months and with help from other guys.i gave up and tried a usb to rj45 adapter and i am online no problem all for the sake of 14 .wished i had tried it earlier.so i would recommend borrowing a wireless usb adapter first to try it.
good luck.
