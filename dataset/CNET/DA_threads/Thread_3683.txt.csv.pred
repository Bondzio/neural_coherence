1.1.1	Hi All, I recently bought a Maxtor External Hard drive (One Touch II, 250gb) and ever since the first day, I cannot seem to copy a file onto it, if the file is larger than approx.	St
1.1.2	4 gigs, is this normal, or should I get it check out?!?!	St
1.1.3	What are my options ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks in Advanced Bristowlicious	St
1.2.1	The drive is supplied in the widely compatible FAT32 format but with that comes a 4GB file size limit.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have alot of important data on the hard drive and need to possibly transfer files larger than 4gb, as I work with video and film.	St
1.3.2	I also use Mac and PC.	St
1.3.3	It is in FAT32 format where the limit is 4Gb as you mentioned, what is the format that will work with both platforms and support &gt;4Gb files, will I have to reformat and delete everything?	St
1.3.4	Thanks Bristowlicious	St
1.4.1	Sorry, but I don't know of a solution for you except to use a file splitter.	St
1.4.2	-&gt; Did you just reveal that you don't have a backup?	St
1.4.3	In the latest version of MacOSX it's supposed to work better with NTFS than ever before.	St
1.4.4	But ask in the Mac forums before you convert the drive to NTFS.	St
1.4.5	While conversion is not supposed to wipe the drive, imagine that a few were surprised with a clean, empty volume.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks Bob, you've been a big help.	St
1.5.2	Will look it to splitting the file, or the NTFS format.	St
1.5.3	Thanks Again Bristowlicious	St
