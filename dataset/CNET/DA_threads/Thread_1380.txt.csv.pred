1.1.1	A couple of days ago I bought the HP Media Center bundle m7267c .	St
1.1.2	Right out of the box I started experiencing problems with it .	St
1.1.3	More specifically the system never did a successful restart , forcing me to do a hard-reset on the box each time .	St
1.1.4	The 'shut-downs ' on the other hand were working fine .	St
1.1.5	I spent a couple of hours with HP Technical Support trying to solve the problem but nothing worked .	St
1.1.6	Eventually they had me do a 'destructive ' system recovery and even that did n't fix it .	St
1.1.7	Out of frustration I put the entire system back in the box and brought it back to where I had originally bought it .	St
1.1.8	They gave me another one on the spot - no problem with this one so far , I am keeping my fingers crossed .	St
1.1.9	Let me just tell you that I was glad I did n't buy this thing on the Web or from eBay .	St
1.1.10	There is something to be said about being able to drive to a store and get a replacement the same day .	St
1.1.11	Other than that this is a very nice system and I love the f1905b display !	St
1.2.1	I agree with those last few sentences : The simplicity of buying local .	St
1.2.2	Its glad to hear a success story once and while .	St
1.2.3	But , alas , alot of buyers ( me included ) sometimes will cave in for the cheaper prices on eBay .	St
1.2.4	Just wondering : Is that an AMD version or Intel ?	Ques
