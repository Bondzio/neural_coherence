For a video card youd probably want to opt for a 7800 GT OC because you can find those online for around 325 dollars.
Also i highly recommend you get one of those new X-fi sound cards from creative.
Its way more powerful than anything else, it has a 3.6 ghz procesor just for sound.
The base version of it goes for around 125.
Not only will things sound better but you will also get higher performance out of your computer.
