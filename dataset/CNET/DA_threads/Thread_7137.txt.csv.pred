1.1.1	I am setting up a home network.	St
1.1.2	I am currently using a wireless net work.	St
1.1.3	I would like to hard wire 5 PCs using Cat 6.	St
1.1.4	I am not presently concerned w/ internet speeds but I would like to have fast PC to PC speeds.	St
1.1.5	Can I attach a Gigabyte switch to my router and get wired gigabyte speeds of transfer from PC to PC?	St
1.2.1	each PC supports GigaByte speed.	St
1.2.2	If each PC only has a 10/100 NIC, that's all you'll get.	St
1.2.3	Since all switched PCs route through the router, the router must support GB also.	St
1.2.4	In short, all devices must support GB speeds to get what you want.	St
1.3.1	The wired path between the PCs all needs to be gigabit capable.	St
1.3.2	Since the whole network could run just fine without a router, it doesn't need to be gigabit capable.	St
1.3.3	The switch routes via the addressees MAC address all by itself.	St
1.3.4	It doesn't need to hand off the data packets to another device.	St
1.3.5	The router could be Cat5 and so could the cable to it.	St
1.4.1	Thanks.	St
1.4.2	Every component supports gigabyte but the router.	St
1.4.3	will the communication ( video streaming) from PC to the server be sub gigabyte if all pcs are hooked up to the switch?	St
1.5.1	In the old days we had HUBs and that rule about the lower speed setting the speed on every port was true.	St
1.5.2	With SWITCHED HUBS or &quot;Switches&quot; (use that name you want) the packets are switched with a store and forward scheme so speeds are switched up, down as needed.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	and the 100 mb limit between your switch and the router isn't going to matter.	St
1.7.1	1,000 Mb/s speed, it'll never happen.	St
