It had some drivers inside(200MB) and when I checked the available space, it was showning 931GB. I checked with the vendor and he said &quot;the acutul and the available capacities are always different and moreover it is having some space reserved for backup&quot;. I do not have the access to the 1024-931=93GBs and the moment and I feel confused. I can see two partitions /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 but only one is accessible to me. Also I am using Fedora 13 and the speed I am getting is 1MB/s which is very low. Pls advice.... Thanks in advance|adarsh

When selling a disk generally the one giving the largest number is used. In the OS usually the other. Nothing wrong with that. Don't know why it's so slow (unless it's connected to a USB 1 port).

Can you please clarify in &quot;There are 2 definitions of GB&quot; ? Also, is Thoshiba the one holding the most space than other manufacturers ? If yes who is the most efficient ? Is 7% a standard rate ?

An OS....such as Windows...rates capacity based on one K-byte equals 1024 bytes. If you think about that for a moment.....and then get out paper and pencil and expand it to one T-byte.....a whole bunch of space is going to vanish.

If it is a case of 1000mB to 1GB, then it around 7%. You are right. But still searching for a way to make it faster. On windows I get 55KB/s. In linux it literally slept.. But will find a way for sure

So here it is, some front USB ports fall back to USB 1.0 speed and while it is well discussed why, after years I found one person to fix it. This means my advice is to use the rear ports. But without make and model, how can I give that advice? About Fedora. Nice but I'd try Ubuntu next. I find its hardware support to be a little better. Bob

It does not have USB ports on the back, but three on the right side and one usb/eSATA port on left, whcih can also used as a USB port(I did not try on that one). And also with windows I can see the transfer rate upto 57MB/s with the ports on the right. Yes I agree with that. Ubuntu has better support and also easy too, than Fedora. But I love fedora !!.

Sorry but I don't write on work on Fedora (just some embedded Linux) so let's let Fedora folk address that OS. http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=261015 seems to echo your post here. Bob

I am afraid it is not a problem with sony, because I am getting reasonably good speed while on windows. Seems like some driver issue in fedora.
