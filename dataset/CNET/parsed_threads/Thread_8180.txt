<s> My parents may get Comcast high speed internet and if they do I want a desktop computer in the room next to mine. </s>
<s> SO is it possible to hook up wireless internet to it. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> You can use some USB Wifi device or even a PCI Wifi card. </s>
<s> Have you seen the linksys.com web site? </s>

<s> This may sound stupid but whats a USB Wifi device and a PCI Wifi card? </s>
<s> Is it a card that picks up he internet. </s>
<s> And could you help me with my post at Desktops. </s>
<s> It's my choice not to duplicate web content. </s>
<s> Your answer was in the website noted. </s>

<s> The difference is the connection. </s>
<s> Both are Wifi. </s>
<s> USB Wifi connects to the USB port of your computer, (any computer that has a USB port - like a laptop or a desktop) PCI Wifi is a PCI interface board, that plugs into any open PCI slots of your computer, which usually rules out a laptop (unless you have a laptop docking station that provides PCI slots for you). </s>
<s> ------------------- For the portability you should go with the USB, but that means it is one more thing you need external to your PC. </s>
<s> Most times that USB device can pull power from that USB connection (another point, if on a laptop, that is going to be one more drain on your laptop batteries). </s>
<s> For the convenience when connecting to a desktop the PCI Wifi might be the way to go. </s>
<s> The caution here, though, is the the antenna, which is usually on the metal back-plate of the PCI card, might not have the range or position to get the best signal from your wireless access point (probably your router). </s>
<s> Check out your options, on that website that Bob mentioned. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
