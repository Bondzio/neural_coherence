i'm always wondering why people leave out the make, model in posts.
why is that.
-&gt; but tell me what date driver you are using.
i see the drivers at  and the date looks to be 2/15/2008.
again, for completeness i'll install the latest chipset and graphics drivers when i see this issue.
your posts never revealed if you did that.
