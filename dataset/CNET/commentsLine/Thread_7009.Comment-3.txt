i agree on the setup.
are all the units the same?
my set up is now a motorola modem from a cable company and a cisco 800 gateway.
now i would like to find a router under $200 that will give the best and reliable results on today new technology, under that price.
i realize there are better quality unit at a higher price.
i need to replace my old linksys router.
do you or any one else can share their results with their router?
