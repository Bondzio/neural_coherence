I have recently bought a new monitor and i'm looking at using it on either an ATI firepro V8700 or a Nvidia Quadro FX4800. Both these cards support display port and DVI. However when i looked at a cable that goes dvi to HDMI for my monitor it says that it only supports up to 1080i. How then can i get a picture in full 1080p if there isn't a cable to support it.
