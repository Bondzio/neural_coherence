1.1.1	I have a 2.4 P4 with a 865 perl board and 1 gb of 400 memory I am satisfied with the computer speed even with PSCS2...but I would like more speed with Nikon NX.	St
1.1.2	Everyone seems to think adding another gb of memory will help me.	St
1.1.3	I am looking for more opinions and also do you think adding a SATA hard drive will help.	St
1.1.4	If 200 dollars will give me a fair improvement ....that will do me much better than spending big bucks for a new computer.	St
1.1.5	I use XP pro and I do no gaming.	St
1.1.6	Thanks for anyones time that tries to help.	St
1.1.7	Gene	St
1.2.1	If this is Nikon's editing software what most find is miniscule gains past 1G of ram.	St
1.2.2	The hard disk is rarely a speed factor during a photo since everything is in RAM.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you would really like some help, we will need some more information.	St
1.3.2	Where do you find the biggest waits now in the software?	Ques
1.3.3	Is it in applying effects or cropping images, or while opening / saving files to your harddrive?	St
1.3.4	The former would point toward RAM / processor preformance.	St
1.3.5	Hard-drive speed mainly dictates the latter.	St
1.3.6	To decide if your program is ram-starved, lets try this.	St
1.3.7	Before opening your Nikon software, pull up your task manager.	St
1.3.8	You can get this by right clicking on your taskbar and selecting 'task manager'.	St
1.3.9	Go to the performance tab and write down the number next to Available Physical Memory.	St
1.3.10	Now open up the Nikon software and note the available memory again.	St
1.3.11	Try opening an image and note this number a final time.	St
1.3.12	You will want a few hundred MBs of ram available or your preformance will fall off drastically as your system starts to swap memory to and from the hard-drive.	St
1.3.13	Feel free to post your numbers back here for review.	St
1.3.14	1GB of ram might be plenty of ram if most of it is free, but if you have several other programs and background processes running, it may not be enough.	St
1.3.15	As far as adding a new hard drive, this will not improve your performance much, unless your current disk is a dinosaur.	St
1.3.16	Adding RAM might be a good step, but it would be worthwhile to check your numbers before going out to make the purchase.	St
1.4.1	Its a little slow opening (rendering)and slower saving( if lots of edits were made)...the edits themself are not too bad.	St
1.4.2	Available memory closed------704684 NX open ----671204 NEF open----324428 I am defragging now to see if that helps.	St
1.5.1	You have more than 300MB free RAM after loading the program and opening a NEF file.	St
1.5.2	That looks good, and I doubt you will see any improvement by adding another gig.	St
1.5.3	The two possible bottlenecks for saving files are processor speed and hard-drive speed.	St
1.5.4	As you might be aware the Nikon NF software doesn't apply the edits to the original file, but saves the edits seperate, keeping the original file intact.	St
1.5.5	This is great in that the original file is undisturbed, but not so great in that a file with several edits becomes a resource hog.	St
1.5.6	Defragging your drive can't hurt, but again you can do a simple test to see which is likely slowing your system the most.	St
1.5.7	In task manager if you click the preformance tab, you can watch your CPU usage while saving a file.	St
1.5.8	If it goes to 100% and stays there for the majority of your wait, you can assume that the processor is the bottleneck.	St
1.5.9	If it stays considerably lower than 100 for the duration of the save, you can assume that your hard-drive speed is to blame.	St
1.5.10	If you need quicker disk-access, your best bet is two SATA disks configured in a RAID-0 configuration.	St
1.5.11	If the processor speed is the bottleneck, then an upgrade to P4 3.0E for about 90 dollars would be your best option.	St
1.5.12	Neither of these is quite as easy as plugging in some more ram, but if you're up to it, there is still some more preformance hidden away in your box.	St
1.6.1	From what you are saying it seems my CPU is OK Now the defrag seems to have helped...still no speed demon but its faster.	St
1.6.2	When I opened NX it hit 60% for about 1 second and then dropped to less than 30% when I opened a NEF it hit 100% for a second or two at most, and dropped to almost nothing until I started editing but never went above above 50 % again even when saving.	St
1.7.1	Yes, it seems that your CPU is sufficient for the work you're doing.	St
1.7.2	Also, the fact that the defrag helped enforces the idea that your harddrive is the culprit.	St
1.7.3	A SATA RAID 0 arrangement will give you the most improvement for the buck.	St
1.7.4	Newegg sells 80 GB SATA Seagate 7200.9 harddrives for less than 50 dollars each.	St
1.7.5	If you buy 2 and hook them up in RAID 0 formation, you will get a 'virtaul' 160GB drive that reads and writes twice as fast as each drive would individually.	St
1.7.6	If you then save your NEF's to the new drive, you would see some improvements.	St
1.7.7	Keep in mind if you decide to go this route, that OEM drives are shipped with just a drive.	St
1.7.8	You should pick up 2 SATA cables for a few dollars each while you're shopping.	Sug
1.7.9	Not being a user of Nikon NX, I really can't say how much imporvement you would see, but if you are willing to invest 100 dollars and an hour of time, you can find out.	St
1.7.10	I would guess that your MAX improvement would be 3 times the preformance of your current setup.	St
1.7.11	The Seagate drives are both quiet and fast.	St
1.7.12	I think you'd be happy with the setup if you decide to go this route.	St
1.8.1	I read &quot;for about 1 second and then dropped to less than 30%&quot;.	St
1.8.2	I know one owner that was complaining about speed and once the application was open the load and save times were only a few seconds.	St
1.8.3	Upgrades were only going to shave a second off here or there.	St
1.8.4	Where is the long times noted?	St
1.8.5	Bob	St
1.9.1	I cannot quantify how much time will be saved.	St
1.9.2	Program load times will not change much if at all, but when reading / writing large files such as NEF files, a faster drive is helpful.	St
1.9.3	In this case, we are looking for a 'fair' improvement.	St
1.9.4	Two Seagate 7200.9 drives will give a preformance increase over anything you could buy a few years ago, and this is what we are looking for.	St
1.9.5	Genece is looking to get a little more performance from an aging computer, and given all the info, and a budget, I believe this is the best that can be done.	St
1.9.6	If you have another suggestion, please contribute.	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	Lets say I do the SATA hard drives and get another 1gb of 3200 ram......and I still have problems.....I am sure I can use the drives , but can I use the memory if I need to get a new MB and processor?	St
1.11.2	Or will I be very limited to the processor I will be able to use ?	Ques
1.11.3	Or I will need to scrap the memory?	St
1.12.1	You will have a few options for upgrade in the future.	Sug
1.12.2	Even with your current motherboard, there is a bit of room to get a faster processor.	St
1.12.3	You can go as fast as 3.4 G on your current board.	St
1.12.4	http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/rl_proc.htm If you decide to go to a new processor / mb combo in the future, my recomendation would be the Core 2 Duo.	St
1.12.5	This can be a costly undertaking, but the good news is that your ram will not be obsolete in the near future.	St
1.12.6	There are motherboards that support DDR ram and Core 2 Duo, and there is little to no loss in speed by not running the latest DDR2.	St
1.12.7	http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2813 I'd say go for it, add the ram and SATA drives.	St
1.12.8	I think you'll be pleased with the results.	St
1.13.1	One more question ....I have been watching the task manager when NX is open and it seems the Page file is the problem....what exactly is the page file?	St
1.14.1	But I've seen zero pagefile activity on 1G RAM machines even with a &quot;GIANT&quot; image file being loaded.	St
1.14.2	Be careful how you measure.	St
1.14.3	As to the RAM being compatible with the next system I'm going to call it as scrap.	St
1.14.4	Or something you sell off with the next system.	Sug
1.14.5	Have you used one of the new Core 2 Duo systems?	St
1.14.6	Very nice.	St
1.14.7	Bob	St
1.15.1	if I save a couple files from NX the page file reads about 800mb used....I really do not know if thats good or bad..	St
1.15.2	But at about 600MB I see strange effects regardless of what the CPU or available memory report..	St
1.15.3	I really have no problem with the speed of this machine with PSCS2 but it drags with NX.	St
1.15.4	Especially if there are a couple files open even though they have been saved.	St
1.15.5	I bet a new machine will solve the problem but I was hoping to find a less expensive fix.	St
1.15.6	There are many at the Nikon forum that claim 2 gbs of memory really help NX but I hate to waste the money if its not going to work.	St
