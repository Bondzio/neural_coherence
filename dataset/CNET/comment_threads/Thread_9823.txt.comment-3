Thanks Willy.
Toner is one thing but now that I have to replace the image drums on 3 of the 4 colors all priced at $165 or more, plus the toner drums on each color, wow.
That hurts.
Is there any place you'd recommend that image drums or toner for Oki' laser printers are not so darn high?
I agree the Oki printers print extremely well but money is tight.
I do appreciate any advice for this area is not my expertise.
Thanks
