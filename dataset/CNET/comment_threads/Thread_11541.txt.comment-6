Thanx for your reply.
I don't have an HP.
My PC was built in local shop.
Has AMD Athlon 1.8GHz processor.
WinXP Home, 512MB RAM; Don't know what MOBO it has or where to find Model#.
Tried removing all PCI Cards as someone else suggested, but no results.
Any other suggestions.
I didn't really want to pay over a hundred bucks just to have it looked at by local Circuit City or Best Buy.
Thanx.
