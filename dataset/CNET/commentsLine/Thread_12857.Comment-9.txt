bob, you said, &quot;i usually have the printer dhcp at first then latter if i have time set it to some known address on my lan.&quot; my printer currently has an ip address of 0.0.0.0. that can't be good.
otherwise, i don't know how to &quot;dhcp&quot; a printer.
is that &quot;automatic&quot; or do i have to go to a command prompt or something?
&quot;you write about using the epson cd but for setting the printer settings on the printer i use the controls on the printer to do that.&quot; i can set ink, maintenance, etc, but the &quot;setup&quot; menu has nothing to do with an ip address or making a connection.
apart from the setup menu button, there is a network settings and a wireless network setting.
but i don't know how they work or how they apply to my printer ethernet-linked to my router.
you said, &quot;and again about the espon cd.
i've found such cds to be out of date even on a new printer.
i always head to epson.com and get their latest.&quot; the cd install worked fine a couple of months ago when i linked the epson to my wireless network.
why should it not work now?
thanks, bob
