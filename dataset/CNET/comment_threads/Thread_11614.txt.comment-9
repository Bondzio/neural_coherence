How old is the computer?
This could be another power switch or power supply problem.
Yes - You should have a surge protector to protect your investment.
No - I seriously doubt it would fix this problem.
In fact, if you believe there is over voltage, that may have been what messed up the power supply if that turns out to be the problem.
If you are having such wild power fluctuations, you should get one of the protectors with the battery backup.
You are probably getting under voltage when it swings the other way.
If this is your home, I would have an electritian investigate this.
It is probably going to mess other things in the house up as well.
