From the looks, it seems like your USB ports are under-powered by the PC.
Check the USB power distribution in your USB hub in device manager.
Ensure it don't go to power savings and try it out.
Given when you plug your speaker to the UPS, have you tried plugging your desktop and speakers to the power mains directly instead?
If it still persist, next is to test your keyboard and mouse with another system to see if similar problems occurs, followed by plugging in a external card-reader or maybe try using your mobilephone connecting the desktop.
If all, except mobilephone works, you have a USB poweroutput issue.
