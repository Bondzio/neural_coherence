You didn't describe in detail what doesn't work.
But to give a little push, FDISK from Microsoft only lets you delete and add partitions.
But once you made that 2GB partition, then you limited what could be done.
You would have to delete all the partitions and start over.
Some don't find FDISK easy enough and pay for PARTITION MAGIC.
I never use PARTITION MAGIC since I learned too long ago how to use FDISK.
