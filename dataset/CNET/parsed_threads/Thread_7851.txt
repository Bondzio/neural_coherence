<s> I'm planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current HP ZT3000's monitor does not work properly (works 1/50 times the laptop is turned on) so it's constantly hooked to an external and... well, no longer a laptop (costs around $600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard). </s>
<s> I remember when I bought a desktop 6 years ago I went with an AMD because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums, and performance-wise they were almost the same. </s>
<s> With all this new intel dual-core, Inter core duo and AMD dual-core, I'm kinda lost now. </s>
<s> What's the best option out there? </s>
<s> What metric do you use to determine &quot;best&quot;? </s>
<s> If it is performance then the Core 2 Duo would be the winner while if it is bang for the buck then it may vary a bit. </s>
<s> I would suggest a dual core laptop, e.g. </s>
<s> Intel Core Duo, Core 2 Duo(which is the successor to Core Duo) or AMD Turion 64 x2, if you do any CPU-intensive tasks. </s>
<s> I would likely stay away from Celeron or Sempron laptops unless you don't mind having a low power processor as these are for low-end systems which isn't the same as saying they use less electricity. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> definitely go with a dual core laptop. </s>
<s> there are 3 main flavors: intel core duo, intel core 2 duo, and amd turion 64 x2. </s>
<s> sometimes you'll see &quot;pentium dual core&quot; which is really a core duo. </s>
<s> the turion 64 x2s are about as fast as a core duo at the same processor speed (GHz); core 2 duo is about 12% faster at the same processor speed. </s>
