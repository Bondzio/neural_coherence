I'm thinking you should install the latest drivers all around from the makers (no Microsoft involvement!)
&quot;after about 5 minutes of use the screen goes blank,&quot; This sounds heat related.
If this was my machine the case cover comes off and and stays off till it's fixed.
I dust it out, hit the heatsinks with compressed air and retest WITH THE COVER OFF.
Good luck, Bob
