Since, you now know the MSI model#, visit the MSI support website.
There locate your model# to determine the specs of your mtrbd.. You can decide what if anything can be saved or xfered to another mtrbd.
and/or be upgraded to yet a newer and better class mtrbd.. Circa 2003 seems to be too old to keep the ram and cpu as mtrbds.
have progressed.
In this light pick one, it need not be MSI but should be should be adaptable for the latest cpu and ram now available to keep current for some time.
Since, you have a custom system, it shouldn't be too hard to go forward.
Though, I suggest you look into &quot;dual-core or multiple core cpu&quot; for best outcome of a typical system now.
If you like check eBay for older and/or used system if you want to keep within the level you're now at determined by the specs you find.
