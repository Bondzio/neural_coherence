i happen to visit officemax and office depot today and gezzz, i didn't know they had so many &quot;shedders&quot; now.
these aren't the little basic shedders neither that you can place atop a trash can, but come far better in motor and cutter ability.
they offer to cut those plastic and cds as well provided you pay enough for such a model.
i just looked them over, i wasn't interested but thought to mention it.
the local stores here has at least 7-8 different models to review.
check them out first hand rather than a catalog or such.
but, i'm sure those with large amp motors(specs) tend to work better(imho).
good luck -----willy
