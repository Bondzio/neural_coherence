I agree with Robert, bundled s/w isn't a given to work on other drives, but you can try. Now, maybe a good time to try a &quot;retail&quot; versions and understand they offer alot more than when you got your older s/w. The most notable are Roxio and Nero. I lean towards Nero, but you can check your CD/RW burner support website they may provide an OEM for your use. If you like a very cheap retail version(older), try this website: http://www.pcliquidators.com/ and look for CD Creator v3.x, I believe under s/w area. good luck -----Willy

If it is name brand burning software, it probably won't recognize the newer drive. You may be able to upgrade the drive recognition part of the software for free. If you have saved burning profiles, some burning software is NOT backwards compatible (yes roxio, I mean you!) The new drive doesn't have decent software?

I still have it running in a win 98 machine. no muss, no fuss. I miss it. with these new programs, I always forget which of the 200 buttons does the one thing I want. I actually have to write little notes to myself to remind me how to do some simple task that took an hour of digging around in menus to find. I can't decipher the program that came with my creative sound card. --fj
