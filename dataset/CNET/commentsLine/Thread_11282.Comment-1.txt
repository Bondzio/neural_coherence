hello; my system is: amd sampron(tm) 2200+ 1.50ghz, 192 mb ram; hard disk 30gb, window xp sp2.
i would like to upgrade the system by adding an extra internal hard drive and replace 192 mb ram to 500mb.
i wonder if if i could do it myself , i haven't done this before.
will i have to reset the whole setting again after installing ?
any advice will be very appreciated.
thomas
