I need to buy a new one soon, but I can't afford a high-end system. I would like to be able to connect a stereo to my new desktop to transfer old vinyl and cassettes to CD. I would also like to transfer digital video from my computer to a VCR. It seems everything I can afford has integrated audio and most have integrated video also. If I buy such a system, can audio and video cards be bought and inserted later? (I'm particularly interested in the audio in/out.)

Upgrading the audio in a system with integrated sound is somewhat easier then upgrading video with the same parameters. A lot a integrated video motherboards do not offer an AGP slot to upgrade, but most have at least one PCI slot available for sound.

It is very easy to make those changes in the BIOS set up on your motherboard. I purchased an integrated motherboard recently and didn't like the on board sound, so I disabled it and I am using a Sound Blaster Live card, which takes up one PCI slot. The same thing can be accomplished with your on board video.
