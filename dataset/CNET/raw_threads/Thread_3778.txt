9565	10	150787	1682118	1681789	GoreRanger	1/18/06 6:55 PM	1.1376105E12	hmmm	lack documentation walk through troubleshooting silicon image raid controller terms chip board controllers their separate sata connections arent mixed using silicon image connections controller saying intel controller somehow messing silicon image controller
