If I were to get a new mobo, and I had an ATI Graphics card, what mobo do you guys think I should get? It seems pretty useless if I bought a SLI Mobo, but I saw some non SLI mobos with 2 PCI-E16 ports (one of the DFI mobos), would it be possible for 2 ATI cards to be used for a SLI like effect?

U wont see a difference in gaming. only in benchmarks, the scores are higher.

Has anyone heard of this? Can this feature be used with ANY graphics card? How does the performance compare to SLI?

4728	8	106401	1216900	1215258	ozos	5/30/05 8:27 PM	1.11748482E12	ok, to explain this to you guys	A) ATI's tech is called AMR, ATI Multi Rendering B) it's release is unknown, but supposedly it comes with R520 (their next gen) which should be out around January C) Dual Xpress is for running 2 video cards for 4 monitors D) currently only certain nVidia based cards can run in SLI and aside from that just get a darn nVidia they support SM3.0 (DirectX 9.0c) while ATI does not, and cannot w/o softawre emulation (Which makes the game run super slow) i'd get a 6800GT and be done with it if you really wanna spend the money, just get a new 512MB 6800 Ultra from BFG, should set you back around $860 but personally, i say 6800GT, decent Athlon64x2, and you should be fine for a while

The reason I'm looking to see if there is a NVIDIA board is because ATI doesn't support Shader 3.0 yet... Is the difference between Shader 2.0 and 3.0 even that big/important? If not, maybe I'll just get the ATI board.

4728	15	106401	1220218	1220100	ozos	6/1/05 4:13 PM	1.11764238E12	your price dif is WAY off	ok, i'll answer the ohter Q's too Shader Model (Pixel Shader and Vertex Shader) 3.0 vs 2.0 it's not a performance thing, unless you don't support it SM 3.0 on GeForce 6 means they can run SM 3.0 stuff smoothly (i've run Half-Life 2 in SM 3.0 on my 6800GT, and it never skipped a beat (at HIGH settings, on a comparativly slow CPU)) while ATI supports SM 2.0 you can software emulate it, BUT it will cut performance down A LOT (it takes a lot of oomph to emulate parts of it) ok secondly nVidia has no competition for the X800XL which is why ATI put it out X800XL is basically a cut down X850XT card it has a full 16 pipes in performance the 6800 Ultra is about 5-15 percent faster, and the 6800GT is about 5-15 percent slower depending on the game/benchmark/who you ask (and in Doom III nVidia cards just whip the stuffing out of that game) personally i'm going to suggest a 6800GT which is about $30 cheaper and more easily avliable for AGP if you want a PCIE card the 6800GT will cost more so that could be where your getting your dif from (the X800XL was released for PCIE first, and AGP second, so it's more expensive on AGP, while the 6800GT was released on AGP first, and PCIE second, so it's more expensive on PCIE (basically the ATI has to convert to AGP, and the nVidia has to convert to PCIE, and the conversion doesn't hurt performance at all)) hope this helps

I was looking at PCI-E these are the prices I saw AGP X800XL - $500+ 6800GT - $400-$500 PCI-E X800XL - $400-$500 6800GT - $490-$600 But now I'm going wait a bit, cause I think the current card prices might drop this summer with new technology possibly coming out.
4728	17	106401	1220515	1220480	ozos	6/1/05 8:00 PM	1.117656E12	oh, it's coming out all right	it's not a possibility it's a definite the question is more so WHEN between now, and July and usually the prices go UP price a 5950 Ultra i gurantee it'll cost over $350 new also where are you shopping? an X800XL for PCIE should cost $300-$350 and for AGP around $325-$375 and a 6800GT for AGP should be $275-$350 and for PCIE around $399-$425

Is this true? cause I think I heard Far Cry or some other game is using SM 3.0 code...
