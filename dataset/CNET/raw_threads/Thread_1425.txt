I also understand the last few years have been a downward spiral for quality and customer service, which used to be their strong suites. I need a new desktop and wondered if Dell has pulled their heads out of their butts yet to keep other makers like HP from taking away their market share further. I'm trying to take some of the current bad stuff written about Dell with a grain of salt. I realize they sell a lot of computers, so they're going to get a larger number of complaints, but percentage of machines sold that are problems are more important than sheer numbers. Besides, unhappy people are more likely to post than satisfied ones. Given the state of things here in June 2008, would anyone recommend an XPS 420? I understand they are supposed to have their own support division.

The market has called for ever lower prices so this means support must transition to non-humans and underpaid staffers. We also have Windows itself to contend with as it's issues continue to this day. Then is no panacea and nothing that appears to be changing this trend. But the hardware looks to be no better or worse than any other maker as I am surrounded by a few hundred dell laptops at the moment. Bob

The last I read for desktops had HP/Compaq and Acer/Gateway as top. They all flip-flop and aren't all that far from each other. Dell's pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality. World-wide they retain good marketshare. My problems with Dell were more a symptom of being mail-order, getting DOA computer and having to ship it back, wasting a lot of time I didn't have. The XPS 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value.

The point being, it really doesn't matter in the long run, so read the fine print and have any problems act on them quickly and note them down. Often, you can do slightly better buying or doing DIY project or have a 3rd party build one. The parts are generic enough across the board so buy what best fits your needs As for XPS systems, they are nothing more than warmed over basic systems. They offer nothing really special other than maybe support and the package deal. Again, 3rd party builders pretty much offer the system. If available in your area, Best Buy, Fry's, etc. offer OEM type systems and at least if a problem crops-up you can return to the store before the real OEM warranty kicks-in. Heck, even Wal-mart offers systems that have prices hard to beat and offer similar specs as well. good luck tada -----Willy

I looked over a few tutorials and parts over at Newegg. I think I could build one just fine, my problem would be being my own Tech Support. The idea of syncing RAM, configuring a RAID setup, and a couple other things freaked me out a little too. I may drop into BB and see what they've got. Another route I thought of was Costco, which sells Dell with I believe a 90 day No Questions return policy.

If something goes wrong, you're left troubleshooting and putting humpty-dumpty together again. Best Buy has Geek Squad right there, so they'll be able to help with stuff. I dunno if they have any XPS 420, but I'm sure they've something comparable in Dell or another brand. You won't even necessarily pay more than you would for DIY. But the advantage of DIY is you build it exactly the way you want it, rather than settling for the configurations that are supplied in a store. My car needed its oil changed. I know how to change my oil, and could have gone to an auto-parts store. But instead I went to Jiffy Lube and got some reading done as they did the job in 1/4 of the time it'd have taken me (not to mention I garage-saled my jackstands and all that junk years ago).

Then we bought a 4Runner and my wife wanted to go to a Jiffy Lube type place, so I thought what the heck, one less vehicle to mess with. Now, with a 3 1/2 year old I love bringing the car into someplace and let someone else climb under the thing, not to mention getting rid of the old oil! I digress...point well taken. I just wondered at the beginning what people's experience has been with Dell's quality of hardware and tech support (if needed, and I'm sure with Vista I'll need a little!) were like in current terms, not the awful stories I heard a year or more ago. I would probably enjoy a DIY (if I really had the time, but when thiings go wrong is where I know I don't have the time nor expertise.
