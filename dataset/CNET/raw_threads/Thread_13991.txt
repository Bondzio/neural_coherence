Using both the motherboard and case manuals i connected the cables for the USB to my motherboard and doublechecked that the pins were correct, but the ports are not working. I did not connect the audio ports and left the pins jumped. I am running Win XP SP2; this is my first case with front USB.

There is no real test other than a voltmeter and that only does voltages. if everything else works, you should have enough for the USB. USB doesn't need that much to run. Since, this is a new build, you have to recheck before you start elsewhere. Don't take things for granted. tada -----Willy
