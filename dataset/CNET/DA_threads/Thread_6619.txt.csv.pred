1.1.3	I want to get a DVD writer & am not sure if I should get an external or internal writer.	St
1.1.4	Which is best?	St
1.1.5	Which is easiest?	St
1.1.6	And which do you recommend?	St
1.1.7	Please, please help me.	Ques
1.2.1	That is a small forum factor PC.	St
1.2.2	While it came with a DVD as an option, it seems unless you buy the unit expressly made for the SFF case, it would be much easier to use an external drive.	St
1.2.3	If you do buy the internal, here is how you install it.	St
1.2.4	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim5150C/en/sm/parts1.htm#wp1075764 High speed USB (2.0) would give you close to internal speeds, so assuming you do not want to go the internal route, I see no real reason to be concerned.	St

1.4.1	If your power supply can handle the extra load then go internal if not external is just fine	St
1.5.1	existing DVD.	St
1.5.2	Here's an IDE DVD-DL by Pioneer that's getting good buyer reviews at Newegg.	St
