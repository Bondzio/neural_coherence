In a notebook, it matters that the OS is known (you didn't tell) and who installed the OS (unknown.)
I'll share one possible fix and not dive into driver discussions until you tell more.
-&gt; Look up WINSOCKXPFIX on google.com to repair the usual spyware induced damaged networking that causes a lot of posts like yours.
Cheers, Bob
