Now this may seem a stupid question but what is a virtual CDRom driver? and what does it do? Does it have anything to do with the burner? I use to be able to burn DVD/CDs on my pc but I have kids and they messed up my system so badly that I had to have it reformated, now I can no longer burn I downloaded nero but I still can't burn. What do I have to do to get this going?
