Well, I read that you could use cat5 cable for phone wire, but I guess that maybe there are complications with using, I guess I will have to find out.
One last question.
I wanted to place the router (wireless) between the upstairs and the downstairs.
This is before I learned that I needed a router and a switch.
Can I connect a wireless router somewhere in the house in addition to the router that I would have with my switch down in the basement?
Seems that the basement is not the best of places to have the wireless positioned.
Or maybe I should run a wire from from the wireless router to the basement to connect to the switch and all my other connections.
Some other options?
