Actually, Windows has nothing to do with it.
Using the same SSID is common (think of when you're using a wireless service in a large hotel.
They have multiple wireless access points with same SSID.
Otherwise they'd have to publish the name of every single one).
I'm just not sure if I need to do something else since I'm using routers instead of dedicated wireless access points.
