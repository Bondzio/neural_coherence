Hi, I have a HP 5200C scanner attached to my ancient Dell xpsr400 puter.
I am a dufus when it comes to upgrades and I bought an OCR software program named OmniPage 10 a while back, but due to other issues only installed it to the computer and not to the scanner.
I try to use the program to increase the scanner's capabilities, but it doesn't seem to help.
What am I missing here?
How do I get better results with the Omnipage software if it is possible?
Any words would be a help!
