fellow members, i recently installed a new hard drive.
in my efforts to get the thing working i must have changed some setting in bios, which i had to fool with, because now the system is doing a tedious ram check routine on the black screen with each boot.
it takes a couple of precious minutes to count up to 512. fyi it is ami bios.
i cannot discover any changes to make in bios setup to disable it.
2. the setup shows the smart drive feature is disabled.
i would like it running.
