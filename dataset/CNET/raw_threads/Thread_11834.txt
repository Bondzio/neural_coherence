I couldn't find any reviews or info on this model so if u guys knew anything it would be greatly appreciated.

As for the gfx card, just get the x300se and upgrade yourself. It comes with 400watt psu, so get a 6600GT. Not sure if the psu can be upgraded though. Its cheaper if you build yourself. But if you too lazy or no idea, go to monarch, or cyberpower and customize it with retail parts instead of oem. Just my two cents.

Now keep in mind that HP will NOT give you the XP CD only a recovery partion on the hard drive. They use a non standard MB so you will not be able to upgrade that. I think of HP as a low cost alternitive to Dell. John
