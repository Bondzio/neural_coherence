For a few weeks ago I bought a new computer, ordered different parts and put it together But there seems to be an issue somewhere.. When I try to boot the computer everything seems fine but the monitor does not get any signal from the VGA card. The monitor notice that its connected to the card but there are no reaction on it what so ever. I have tried to check my wires but I seem to have done all in the right manner. I have tried to put the motherboard on its cardboard box and connect only RAM, vga/card and gpu and processor, but still nothing. This is my spec: Antec Two Hundred Midi Tower Sort Vifter: 1x 140mm Top, 1x 120mm Back, ATX, mATX, mI Akasa Amber 120mm Fan 120x 120 x 25mm, 1400 RPM, 4.8 CFM, 18 dBA, 3 Pin ASUS M4N75TD, Socket-AM3 ATX, nForce750a, DDR3, 2xPCIe(2.0)x16, GbLAN Corsair CX 430W PSU ATX 12V V2.3, 80 Plus, Standard. 1x 6+2pin PCIe, 4 Kingston ValueR. DDR3 1333MHz 4GB, CL9 Kit w/two matched ValueRAM 2GB DDR3 AMD Athlon II X2 250 Dual Core, 3.0Ghz, AM3, 2MB, 65W, Boxed ASUS ENGT220 GPU: GeForce GT220 Video Memeory: 1GB DDR2 Engine Clock: 625MHz Memory Clock: 800MHz (128 bit) DVI Max Resolution: 2560x1600 Bus Standard: PCI-E 2.0 DirectX 10.1 Support: YES HDMI Output: Yes (Native HDMI) Standard Output: DVI-I, D-Sub Output HDCP Compliant: YES Low Profile: YES As you see the speccs are not gr8. But I intend to use this PC as a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), and thats all. I have tryed to figure out what the problem is but I cant seem to find it. I wondered if you smart people of this forum could help me out here! Greetings from Norway: Andreas
