I've got a choice between these 3 configurations, but i can't make up what the best choice would be. 1: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ (dual-core) 2048 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GTX PCI-E (768 MB DDR 3) 2: INTEL Core 2 Quad Q6600 (FSB 1066) 4096 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GT PCI-E (512 MB DDR 3) 3: AMD Phenom Quad 9600 4096 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GT PCI-E (512 MB DDR 3)

AMD processors seem to load the os quicker and have overall faster response times. In addition,, choice 3. also has more RAM, and working with that quad core processor, you should have a gaming powerhouse!

I heard other people say that it would be better to take a dual core, because the quad core is quite good at multitasking, but the dual core performs better at gaming (single application) and in this setup it has a slightly better graphics card. Then again in other topics ive been reading that intel is now slightly better with Intel core 2 processors then AMD. So im getting confused and don't know what is true and or better.

While the two Intel Processors might be faster, when it comes to gaming, it's the GPU that really counts. This might help you decide: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-gpu-upgrade,1928.html good luck

But im also convinced that the GPU is very important. The phenom quad sunk to the bottom of my list at the moment . So i gues it's up to what is more important when gaming. The difference between the AMD x2 6000+ and Intel's CPU. or The difference between the AMD x2 6000+ and Intel's GPU. Today i will go to the store, see what the opinion is of the guys who will put em together. I bet they have some experience with customers buying them and how things evolved. Will report back later what they had to say . And thanks all for the advice, it did help me.

This is the setup i finally went for: INTEL Core 2 Quad Q6600 (FSB 1066) 4096 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Asus EN9800GX2/G/2DI/1G Geforce EN9800GX2 (1 GB DDR3, 256-bit, 2 x DVI-I)

4859	10	297051	2788229	2788191	daylightcnet	6/6/08 2:50 PM	1.2127638E12	Windows xp i think	Ive ordered the computer, i don't have it yet, i will have it tomorrow. The OS ill be installing will be windows XP, not that i dislike vista, but vista seems to take more resources that i don't need while gaming. Also if i check the official game webpages i often see that the minimal/requirement/optimal system page asks for a heavyer system when your OS is vista and lower when your OS is xp. So if they say xp needs less powerfull system to get the same results then im not going to run vista because it prolly slows the system down a bit. At least thats what my logic tells me, anyone let me know if i am wrong.
