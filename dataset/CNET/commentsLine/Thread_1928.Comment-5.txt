same thing.
wouldn't cloning a drive be better than using a file transfer utility?
pc mag on f.a.s.t.
pros: comes with windows xp.
transfers windows and outlook settings as well as files.
simple and straightforward.
cons: no-frills tool with primitive interface provides limited user control, no reports, no undo capability, no application transfer.
bottom line: provides bare-bones migration of essential data files and windows settings.
good just for basic transfer.
