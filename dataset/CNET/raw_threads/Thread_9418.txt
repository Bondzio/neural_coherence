On the front, it has a &quot;save&quot; button. I assume this is to save, or lock the settings. Does anyone know how to unlock, or turn the &quot;save&quot; function off, when I try to adjust the settings, it says &quot;saved&quot;, and won't let me change anything. I don't have the manual, and have not been able to find any info on thier web site. Thanks
