i'm putting together my first pc pretty soon, and am trying to figure out which type of processor to go for.
i'm not looking for top of the line gaming monster, but i am trying to build a solid machine that will keep me playing new games (fallout 3, prince of persia, left 4 dead, etc) for a couple years.
so i'm trying to decide, should i go with a tried and true dual core processor such as the intel core 2 duo 3.16 (  ) or perhaps one of the newer quad cores with a lower clock speed?
i'm a little hesitant since recommended gaming specs are already hitting 2.6ghz, which will be my starting speed if not less if i go with a quad core.
but will the extra cores make the difference?
also, i'm going with intel on this one just because it's familiar and i'd prefer to stay on fairly stable ground for my first build.
just saying.
advice appreciated.
if anyone has any more comments on my box as a whole (also debating graphics card) you're more than welcome to check over the tentative parts list:  .
