Who would want a Windows tablet now?
Well OK.
If you want to shell out $1500 for a slate.
But for iPad level ( hardware/price point ) MS has spent a decade proving it can't do a good job in that arena.
Maybe when Win 8 has been out for a while, but not now.
As for iPad, given the hardware you will be overpaying.
What's the matter with Android?
