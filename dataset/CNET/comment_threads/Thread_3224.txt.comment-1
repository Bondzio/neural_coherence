Anyway I am having a problem with the computer power switch.
I have an emachines W3080 and it's about two years old.
Lately the power switch seems to be getting stuck in the case a lot.
When you push it to turn it on, it's not coming back out it stays there for some reason.
Not all the time but a lot.
I was wondering if anyone else had this kind of problem and what they did to correct this issue?
Thank you.
Michelle
