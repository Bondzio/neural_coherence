and i agree in principle with mrmacfixit - but to claim &quot;exactly the same way&quot; *could* be inaccurate.
fonts are different (though nearly all map between the platforms); *some* formatting may be a little different.
viruses from the pc will not infect the mac (if you are using osx and not windows) - but if you send the infected file to windows uses, they *could* be infected.
i use an hp/compaq laptop running windows xp and the microsoft suite for work... and transfer files to my personally owned home osx mac using neooffice... and everything i need seems to transfer back and forth between the machines just fine... since we don't know all your real specifics (use of macros what software loads you are expecting to use, etc.
), it is a little tough to say &quot;exactly the same way&quot; - but it will be really close... for the most part, the compatibility issues have been gone for several years - and if there is something truly windows-only, you can always run that os on the mac...
