look at  where i'm doing a daily or more backup of a project directory using what windows gives me.
it's just a right click and to a zip file which i can elect to copy off to usb memory stick, other hard disks or other places.
i don't bother trying to backup just this or that.
i get the whole set and am never held hostage by a proprietary backup program.
try simple.
