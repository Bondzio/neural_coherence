it is a good thing your acer hasn't given you any problems.
when i bought mine last month, it had a bad sound card.
in order to repair it, i would have to mail the entire computer to the depot and then they will take 7-10 business days to repair it, so, with using priority mail (i live in the us virgin islands), i would be without a computer for a month.
this is no way to run a business and i will never buy another acer; consequently, i can't recommend acer to anyone else.
there were other problems, too, with the pre-installed software.
frankly, i found acer to be a nightmare unless you live in the same town as the depot.
