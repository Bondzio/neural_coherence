My problem is that it is not Vista compatible and HP's response is &quot;upgrade&quot;.... Any ideas???

It's a little rough on some but the gist is that many linux printer drivers take in postscript, render it to the raster that the printer wants and that gets printed. The longest I found someone to take setting this up is a few months. But they really wanted to save the printer. Bob

You can get printout from Linux noted at http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-OfficeJet_Pro_1170C So set up a Linux box and print from there. Bob
