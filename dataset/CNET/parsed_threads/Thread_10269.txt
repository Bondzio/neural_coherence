<s> I will soon be purchasing a new desktop pc and a new 50'-60' HDTV (I do not know what of the above I am purchasing yet...). </s>
<s> I would like to be able to sit-down and watch cable tv in full 50'+ HDTV. </s>
<s> I also want to be able to play games/work on the full tv. </s>
<s> Finally, I would like to be able to watch TV on half of my TV while playing games/working on the other half of my TV. </s>
<s> I also also like to take advantage of some video cards' abilities to act like Tivo (record/pause live TV). </s>
<s> I do not intend to purchase a DVD player and plan to use the PC's DVD reader to play any movies I wish to watch in HD format, therefore I probably need a kick-ass sound system coming from my pc...... IS THIS REALISTIC????? </s>
<s> If so, can someone point me in the right direction as to what to buy or hardware requirements? </s>
<s> I'm hoping to be at or below $5,000 (I assume approx. </s>
<s> $1500 for a good desktop PC (im thinking a 64-bit Athlon with Windows Media Center), approx. </s>
<s> $2000 for an HDTV, and approx. </s>
<s> $500-1000 for sound system/installation/incidentals. </s>
<s> THANK YOU for any advice or direction you can provide!!! </s>

<s> This depends on a lot of things. </s>
<s> But it will be a TV or monitor, not both at the same time. </s>
<s> Now your MCE PC can have a HDTV tuner in it, using the TV tune and playing games at the same time??? </s>
<s> Also keep in mind that most HDTVs are just a monitor and do not have a HDTV truner in them, this is changing and soon they all will have the HDTV turner in them. </s>
<s> The best ones I have seen are the Apple cinamavison LCDs. </s>
