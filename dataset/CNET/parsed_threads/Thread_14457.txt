<s> Mu computer, a Dell using XP Pro, is completely screwed up by the Trojan I received from someone. </s>
<s> It has blocked my ability to access the internet,task manager, copying files or installing any software to find the virus. </s>
<s> Please, your assistance would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> try to install super anti-spyware http://www.superantispyware.com/ if that doesnt work let me know </s>
<s> Please try to scan your computer with updated &quot;Malwarebytes&quot; and &quot;Superantispyware&quot; programs in safe mode. </s>
<s> If you do not have the recommended software to scan your computer, and you are unable to download it because you can't get on the internet......... ...then you will have to download it from another computer and move the install file to a portable media device that connects through USB or SD or 1394 (etc). </s>
<s> And then move or copy the install file to your computer that is infected, open the file to install the software, and run the scans...... </s>
