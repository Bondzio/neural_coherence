13727	0	146768	1639968	NR	mhst	1/1/06 3:53 PM	1.13613078E12	wired vs. wireless print server	I use a wireless network at home with a linksys broadband router. I would like to have wireless access to my HP 1012 LaserJet printer, which is located next to the router, but there is no PC connected. We use 2 laptops and only the one printer at home. I am unsure whether to use a wired print server such as D-Link DP301-U to connect the router to the printer or to get a linksys wireless print server. Which would be easiest in terms of use and configuration? I'm a novice at networking. Thanks.
