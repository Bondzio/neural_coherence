<s> I have a HP Pavillion mx70 monitor on a HP Pavillion XT983. </s>
<s> I had a power surge at home during a storm. </s>
<s> The first time I turned it on, it was fine and then it just shut off. </s>
<s> If I unplug the monitor from the back of the computer it will come out of standby mode and say check cable. </s>
<s> I have hooked up another monitor to my computer and I get nothing. </s>
<s> The computer will come on but I don't think it is booting up because the light doesn't keep flashing as if it's booting up. </s>
<s> I have the stupid recovery cd's (although I don't wanna wipe out my computer) but the first step is turn the computer on and press F1 at the blue screen, you only have a few seconds. </s>
<s> WELL I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE BLUE SCREEN APPEARS CAUSE THE MONITOR DOESN'T COME ON SO HOW CAN I!!! </s>
<s> And I have certainly tried to just start pressing F1 after I turn it on and go through steps of re-whatever the BIOS but it hasn't worked because once again THE MONITOR DOESN'T COME ON SO HOW CAN I!!! </s>
<s> Maybe I just shot the video card or something? </s>
<s> Found directions to delete and reinstall the video card but once again THE MONITOR DOESN'T COME ON SO HOW CAN I???? </s>
<s> Get the point Sorry but I'm frustrated! </s>
<s> Can some one please please please please help me?! </s>
<s> Don't wanna take it to no &quot;PC Dr&quot; cause they're as expensive as me going to the Dr! </s>
<s> THANKS FOR ANY HELP!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Have you opened the case and unplugged the video card and re-inserted it??? </s>
<s> Calm down and lets do some logical troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Re installing is NOT part of logical troubleshooting. </s>
<s> The power surge may have done damage to more than one thing. </s>
<s> With the cover off and you hit the power button, what fans, drives, et al turn on or???? </s>
<s> Give us some detailed symptoms. </s>
<s> You could have lost part of the power supply. </s>
<s> Diagnosing a no video scenario is a matter of stripping down the machine to its basic components (Motherboard/Power Supply/CPU/HSF/speaker). </s>
<s> If you get no beeps the troubled hardware is one of the four. </s>
<s> If you get any beeps you can add RAM, more beeps add video. </s>
<s> I'm calm now I had been searching the internet for a few days and getting no where. </s>
<s> I don't know what to unplug. </s>
<s> I'm not computer savy in the department of hardware but a friend of mine may be able to help me do that. </s>
<s> The fan in the middle by the power button comes on, however the fan behind the cd drive doesn't come on. </s>
<s> computer that it is tough to help. </s>
<s> Knowing the vintage of the system and what CPU and memory is used can be very helpful. </s>
<s> Does the CPU have a HSF on it [heat sink & fan]? </s>
<s> That is the key fan to be rotating. </s>
<s> The others should work also, but with no cooling for the CPU, the system may not boot or will shut down quickly. </s>
<s> Try your friend, if he could use some help have him work with you replying to this thread. </s>
<s> It may take some back and forth dialog but we usually find the cause. </s>
<s> [and sometimes fix it. </s>
<s> LOL] </s>
