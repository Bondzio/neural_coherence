<s> I'm very successfully using a Sprint Sierra broadband card as an ISP. </s>
<s> It is connected to a Cradlepoint mobile wireless router. </s>
<s> My two home PCs each see the connection just fine. </s>
<s> But they are not networked to each other. </s>
<s> How can I get them to see each other and to be able to add other items to the network through the router? </s>
<s> Or learn about firewalls, shares and accounts. </s>
