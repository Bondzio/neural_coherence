If you restart your computer everytime you use it, you can write a 'batch file' that is placed in your startup folder that can copy data from one drive to another.
That other folder could be another computer accessed through a network.
I don't have that great of memory, but I get by through using a dvd burner every month.
Thats all I need becuase my data doesnt change dramitically every few days.
A raid 1 will only help if your computer crashes becuase of bit rot, or a defective drive.
Usually data is lost becuase of user error, an incomplete backup before an OS reinstall.
You want a backup solution that is out of the case of your computer and most preferably off the same fuse (In case of electrical surge).
Good luck finding an easy way to backup data.
