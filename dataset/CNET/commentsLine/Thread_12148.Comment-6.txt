*i would guess that no additional ports need to be added to the installed printer in the vista printer and fax folder unless i was trying to connect it to a printer on the xp machine; for instance, if i moved the printer to the xp machine.
obviously, the xp machine would be the source of the server and printer names to be entered into the port being added to the vista printer found in the vista printer and fax folder.
