<s> Should I buy a G4 powerbook now or wait for the G5 to come out? </s>
<s> I'm trying to maximize my money spent. </s>
<s> I'm willing to spend for the top of the line, just would like to know if anyone knows G5 release dates, etc. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> The G5 laptop is still a myth, rather like the 3Ghz G5 processor, and it's release date is anyone's guess. </s>
<s> No matter when you buy a computer, there will be a bigger, faster, better machine on sale the next month. </s>
<s> Go get your G4 laptop and enjoy it. </s>
