I have bought an ipod touch and tried to connect to my wireless router. However it would't connect even though I entered the correct wep password. Looking at other forums I turned the security off on the router and my ipod then connected. However I would rather have security on my network, so I decided to change a couple of other settings using my computer. One of these was the MAC address filtering. I decided to enable it! However as soon as I did this the computer disconnected. I am now unable to connect with the computer or a laptop because of the MAC address filtering and can't connect my iPod because of the security. Any help would be appreciated with these 2 problems. The most important is getting internet connection back, and secondly allowing my iPod to connect with security still enabled. Thank you very much for your help. Anything will be appreciated.

Figure 2 to 5 minutes for today's tools to crack and connect or at least interfere with your connection. It's why our forum sticky offers another setup. Bob
