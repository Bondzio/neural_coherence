I clicked on the printer icon in the control panel which brought up the printer. When I right clicked on the printer, it displayed the words 'paused - deleting'. I un-paused the printer, the documents in her queue printed, and the printer disappeared. I re-installed the printer but could never get anything to print. The first item in the print queue would have a printing status of 'error-printing'. Running the Windows troubleshooter yielded nothing. I could not print a test page, print from DOS, etc.. I then did a system restore to get her system back to a week ago. The printer once again said paused - deleting, only the documents were the new documents I'd tried to print after the re-install. I un-paused and the new documents printed. And the printer again disappeared. I can't seem to fix this. Any ideas?

The heading on the Peripherals Forum declares that 'CNET's Forum on peripherals is the best source for finding help, troubleshooting, and getting buying advice from a community of experts. Discussion topics include laser printers, inkjet printers, external hard drives, Webcams, monitors, keyboards, and mouse questions'. I posted this question over a month ago and have had zero responses. Is there something wrong with the way I phrased the question?

My thought is the old stop and start the print spooler issue or fix. I make no apologies for Microsoft leaving this unfixed and decline to dive into a dissertation about it. So the short answer is that its still buggy. You can improve it sometimes with the latest service pack and HP's drivers but even then, I'll have to open the command line up and stop the spooler, delete a few files and restart it. In closing you may not know this so let me add the video driver is used to render some content. This means we want the video driver to be current too. Good luck, Bob
