if these drives are going to be used for storage and what's currently on there doesn't matter, then i highly recommend you just wipe 'em out.
formatting is fine, usually, but there's always bits of info strewn about and they still might cause security concerns.
the best option is to just wipe 'em out using either freeware software like dban or paid software such as wipe drive.
(i use wipe drive, actually.
i recommend spending the dough, it's worth it.)
it will wipe every sector of the hard drive, ever piece of data, every virus, all of it gone.
replaces it with random, empty 0's and 1's.
when you put the drives back to use, they'll need to be formatted as the system will see them as brand new hard drives.
like you had just pulled them out of the box.
it's time consuming, i won't lie, but it's worth it.
