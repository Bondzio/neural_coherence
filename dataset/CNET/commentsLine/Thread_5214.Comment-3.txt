ok, as per cpu-z, model : p4i65gv chipset: i865p/pe/g/i848p (whatever that means) it's a home build.
power supply: quantum hi-tech.
model no.
piv-300t it doesn't list any wattage, but gives a chart of volatge and current outputs.
does that help?
and oh, i have two hard drives.
by the way, aren't consoles a better solution to the ever increasing &quot;upgrade&quot; demand of computers?
