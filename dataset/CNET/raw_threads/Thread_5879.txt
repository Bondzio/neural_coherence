Thinking that I had managed to clean it up succesfully, I switched off the computer and went to bed, big mistake as it would seem. When I came to restart the machine, an error message appeared saying: &quot;Windows could not start because of the following file is missing or corrupt: \windows\system32\config\system&quot; I tried repairing this through the windows XP cd but the cd could not find the OS to repair it. I have another computer that I thought I could install the hard drive to, clean it up and use it as a slave HD. When I connected it, the computer recognised that there was another HD connected but in My computer I could not open the drive, but instead I would receive a message for me to format the drive. Does anyone know of a soloution to this? If possible I don't want to format this HD as I have some very important stuff on there. I'm thinking that maybe I have done something wrong when I plugged in the HD in to the other computer, maybe I have to do something else?? Any advice is will be very helpful. Thank you

You might want to get the driver manufacturer's utility program and do a diagnostic and full erase proceedure with that before formatting. As such you might be able to rule out possible problems with the magnetic media on the platters.
