1.1.1	Hi - I 'm looking to purchase an external drive enclosure that works with Windows 7 .	St
1.1.2	I would thought that this would be fairly easy .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately I am finding out that they spec in for windows XP , Vista , but very few for Windows 7 .	St
1.1.4	A few that have advertised for Windows 7 in the buyers ' reviews will mention that the ads are incorrect and they do not work with Windows 7 .	St
1.1.5	Hoping someone here can provide some recommendations .	St
1.1.6	I 'm hoping to find an enclosure that holds the entire drive as opposed to the drive just plugging in the top of the drive enclosure .	St
1.1.7	Thank you .	St
1.1.8	Have a Great Day , Jim	St
1.2.1	why an external hard disk should work with XP and Vista and not with Windows 7 .	St
1.2.2	So find your local computer shop , let them show that it works with any of their Windows 7 PC 's ( they wo n't have anything else in the shop anyway ) and let them assure you that of course you can return it if it does n't work with you .	St
