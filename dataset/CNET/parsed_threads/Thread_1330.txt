<s> Does anyone know how to restore a file after emptying the recycle bin (not how to restore one that's currently in the bin)? </s>
<s> I accidently deleted something and didn't realize my mistake until after I had emptied my recycle bin. </s>
<s> I know that windows doesn't actually erase the data until something else needs the space (or something like that), so I stll have hope. </s>
<s> There is a prog called Directory Snooper (dirsnooper.exe) that can do this. </s>
<s> But it is not freeware, but will be useful during the trial period. </s>
<s> http://www.undelete.com used to have a demo so you could tell if you wanted it. </s>

<s> If you are using XP, Excutive Software sells a program called UnDelete. </s>
<s> Their website is http://www.executivesoftware.com . </s>
<s> You are correct in assuming that windows does not delete a file when you have deleted it from your system. </s>
<s> The first character of the filename is changed to a ? </s>
<s> and windows no longer recognizes that the program exists. </s>
<s> If you have NOT written or deleted anything to your hard drive, you may be able to recover it using a program called Win Hex and change the ? </s>
<s> back to the original first character. </s>
