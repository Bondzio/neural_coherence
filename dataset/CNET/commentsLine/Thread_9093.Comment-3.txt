you need to give a lot more info to get this right.
what brand/model server do you have?
is it a brand name or a clone?
is there even room inside for more drives?
are the existing drives scsi or ide (many servers use scsi drives).
you might consider adding a snap server to the network to add disk space instead of adding more drives to the system.
