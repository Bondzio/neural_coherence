i just added a new 100 gb hard drive to my dell desktop computer because i ran out of storage.
i need to know how to transfer all files and data from my old drive to the new.
i specifically tried to transfer my itunes folder to the new drive, since it was the largest folder, and it didn't work.
i suspect it has to do with system files being on the &quot;c&quot; (original) drive and the programs don't know to look for the songs on the &quot;f&quot; (new) drive.
should i just &quot;disk copy&quot; or purchase a transfer utility program?
if there is an easier solution, i would be gratefule for the tip.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks.
