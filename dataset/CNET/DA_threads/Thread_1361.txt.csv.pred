1.1.2	Fan1 and Fan2 on the motherboard are not working any longer.	St
1.1.3	I used a tester on the three prongs and this is what reads: Fan1= prong1 11.1v, prong2 .91v, prong3 is the ground Fan2= prong1 3.5v, prong2 9.53v, prong3 is the ground My BIOS has nothing for fan settings.	St
1.1.4	I haven't found any program that controls my motherboard fan.	St
1.1.5	The only trouble shooting was plugging an exhaust fan into all 3 fan oulets off my motherboard.	St

1.2.1	before your PC posts hit the delete key to go into the bios then scroll to the last tab and chose the option that says load defualt setup hit f10 to save then rebbot and try again if that doesnt work then you may need to reflash your bios with an updated version if that doesnt work it may be in fact a bad power supply or failing power supply meaning it is about to go bad 1-800-33qad;	St
1.3.1	I cleared CMOS went into BIOS and set it to default BIOS then tried Default Setup.	St
1.3.2	Gene Smith from Award BIOS told me there is an update for Bios, but that BIOS for my 7 year old motherboard has nothing to control or monitor fans.	St
1.3.3	He said something about my motherboard having no sensors for fans.	St
1.3.4	Is there any way to test my power supply, or trace for a short on my motherboard?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks for your input, -Joe	St
1.4.1	fan connector to the mobo, that voltage is provided by a separate chip [or two] on the mobo.	St
1.4.2	The voltages are modulated by a variable on/off cycle, thus the voltage readings cannot readily be accurately read by a Digital voltmeter [nor a D'arsonval movement.	St
1.4.3	Got an Oscilloscope???	St
1.4.4	The chip probably got zapped.	St
1.4.5	Get an adapter and run them at 12 Volts from a PS Molex.	St
