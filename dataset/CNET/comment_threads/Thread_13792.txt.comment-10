I believe that is the model of PSU I have.
Also, my point was that when I took off the heatsinks the first time, there was WAY too much paste on both of them.
It looked like they were trying to ice a cake or something.
So thats why I went ahead and replaced it on both of them with much less of a higher quality paste.
Chances are I just didn't put the heatsinks back on completely perfectly.
I should be getting a call tomorrow from the little shop I brought it to so I can pick it up.
I will update then as to what the issue turns out to be.
In the meantime.
I appreciate everybody interest in my issue and for trying to give me a hand!
