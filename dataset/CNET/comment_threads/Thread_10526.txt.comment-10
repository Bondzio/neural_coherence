I received my PLK200 and PLE200 last week and really gave them a workout over the weekend.
I tried them in every obscure location in my house and am extremely happy with the results.
No dropped signal; constant signal strength; and virtually no hiccups.
The set up wizard was extremely easy.
Hadn't thought about the encryption, so I'll go back and set that up.
The only complaint I have with the units is the ethernet cable that is included is only 3-4 long and barely reached from my router to the wall outlet, so I had to buy some longer cables.
