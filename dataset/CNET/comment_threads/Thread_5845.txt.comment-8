I agree, seeing that the drive is most likely in it's last moments of life, it is best to attempt to copy any needed data from this Drive.
( You may only get one chance) Any time a hard drive starts to make noise, it is a sure sign of inevitable failure.
Hint: Backup immediately!!
There are different types of data storage media available to the public.
Pick the one that is within your budget.
Hard Drives are relatively inexpensive to replace nowadays as well.
