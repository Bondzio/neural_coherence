I have a HP Pavillion 8756 that I just upgraded to XP from ME, I find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my RAM....
I have 2 x 126MB sticks and would like to put in 2 X 256MB sticks.
(There are only 2 slots on the mother board) Problem is that I'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...Probably 133MHZ but, how can I be sure before I go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks????
Is there a way to find out in the computer configuration?
I don't have my original books either!!!
