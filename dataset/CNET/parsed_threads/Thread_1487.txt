<s> I just have a quick question. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if these printers that say direct usb photo printing or pc-free photo printing will also print documents? </s>
<s> I've got no experience with this and can't confirm it either way. </s>
<s> I know the more expensive ones will print documents, but I am hoping to find a sub $200 multifunction printer that can print documents via a USB flash drive. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> It should certainly be in the specs if they were able to render an xxx document (for xxx read: pdf, .docx, WordPerfect 9, AbiWord, ODT, .xlsx etc) without a PC to tell them about the fonts and having the Word or Excel or WordPerfect or OpenOffice reader to do the rendering work. </s>
<s> Which means: I don't think it exists. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> It is not possible for DOC printing on such a printer today because the RENDERING of the DOC depends on the user's printer settings (in Windows), the fonts on the host machine that can affect rendering and more. </s>
<s> PDF can side step this so can you use PDF? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks that makes sense. </s>
<s> I did end up calling HP and Epson. </s>
<s> Epson said no, but the HP guy told me that their OfficeJet 8500Aplus can print pdf's and maybe doc files. </s>
<s> He said you can email doc files to the printer. </s>
<s> I don't know, but it makes sense about the fonts and other rendering issues. </s>
<s> If I get one and try it I'll update this thread with the results. </s>
<s> Thanks guys (or girls). </s>
<s> The main reason for these printers as I know it is to provide PC free access to print. </s>
<s> In other words, no PC is needed, it is a &quot;stand-alone&quot; device which is great as you to place some memory card or such and allow the printer to start a &quot;photo print&quot; from that source. </s>
<s> What you want or appears is basically a dual mode operation. </s>
<s> In effect a printer as always attached to a PC but has the provided ports to attach a memory card and start printing , again on its own. </s>
<s> What, if available is entirely should be explained in the specs of the printer reviewed. </s>
<s> If attached as a PC type printer you would think it still prints from the PC side as before but if on a memory card, will it? </s>
<s> That's the question you wanted answered. </s>
<s> This would be a feature they would want listed. </s>
<s> If all it provides is photo output when on memory card, then no docs, etc.., is supported. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
