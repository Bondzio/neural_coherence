I forgot to mention, that new HP pc only cost 500 bucks with tax at walmart, it has a celeron D processor at 2.93 gigs and ddr ram so its fast.
the thing to do, since it has windows xp installed is: disable the windows firewall and the norton anti virus and get Zone Alarm firewall and the AVG anti virus, theyre bothe free and have served me well since 2001.
The windows xp has sp2 thats why i would do those things, theres been no problem since x-mas, hope i helped ya,later.
