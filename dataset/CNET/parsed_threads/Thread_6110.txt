<s> I work in a law office, and we recently moved from paper files to electronic files. </s>
<s> Now we scan all of our clients documents onto an external hard drive. </s>
<s> The problem is that nobody but me can transfer those docs from the hard drive into the appropriate clients folder. </s>
<s> When anyone does, the following message pops up...&quot; &quot;Cannot copy file: Acces is denied. </s>
<s> Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; Is there any way to grant acces to other comps other than mine? </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out with this? </s>
<s> I missed which OS so I'm guessing XP. </s>
