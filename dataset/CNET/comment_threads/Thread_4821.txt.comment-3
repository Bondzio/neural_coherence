I've found a micro-switch that detects that the cover is in place.
When I manually activate the switch, the project lamp comes on.
It appears that some small piece of the molded plastic cover is broken off.
I'll need to fashion something and attach it with PVC cement.
That might work.
Looks like we'll make a teacher happy and maybe this finding will help someone else.
