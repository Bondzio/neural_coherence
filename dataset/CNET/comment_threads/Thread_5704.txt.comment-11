Called in to who?
(Dumb question?
lol) This is why I posted my problem here, hoping someone had the same issue and a fix for it.
It's quite a unique case, otherwise it would be known by Netgear.
There were a few previous versions of firmware that seemed to perform better -- but the problem was still there.
That suggests a flaw in the firmware, but there's thousands of people who use Netgear routers on the same ISP as me.
It would be known straight away if there was such a problem.
When I test it at my friend's house on his connection, if the result is fine, I'll ask for a new cable modem from my ISP.
My current one is around 5 years old and the modems they ship now are completely different.
