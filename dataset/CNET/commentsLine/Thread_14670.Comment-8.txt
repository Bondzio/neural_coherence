probably no harm in doing that.
however, doing anything to something that didn't need fixin' might make the problem worse vice better.
i'd rather research and pinpoint the problem more before executing unneeded fixes.
i like idea of checking temps first .. before tearing stuff apart and reapplying tp.
it could be something as simple as the cpu fan.
just my 2 cents.
