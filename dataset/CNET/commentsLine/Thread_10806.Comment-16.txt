now i think the real problem behind it.
yesterday i managed to connected to the router for 8hrs+ without a single disconnection but today after logging in for 4hrs it start to disconnected again and i went into the room where the router were placed and it was quite warm because my friend forgotten to on the air condition.so i guess when the router got overheat it will make wireless connection harder so any idea to tips or even a special cooler like those one used to cool the laptop with a kind of special cooler fan ?
