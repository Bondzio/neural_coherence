<s> I have a LAN with windows 2000 server and windows 2000 XP and Windows 2000 professional workstations. </s>
<s> I am not able to browse the network from my network places to pick shared items. </s>
<s> Suprisingly, I am able to ping all machines in the network, internet connection sharing is working perfectly and emails as well. </s>
<s> Any Help? </s>
<s> without knowing the physical layout of your LAN. </s>
<s> Assuming from your statement that ICS is being used, it's likely file sharing has been turned off. </s>
<s> Also check your workgroup names and disable any firewalls until the network is up and running. </s>
<s> This may be just a helluva coincidence, but it's happening, from one day to the next, on my home net and on the office net. </s>
<s> It started happening after I installed the latest WIN and IE security updates from Microsoft. </s>
<s> I can't browse the network (&quot;network unavailable&quot; warning) - yet the FIND command locates any computer on the net and grants access, as does the cd\\&lt;computername&gt; command. </s>
<s> Also, any previous links in Network Neighborhood work. </s>
<s> ICS works fine. </s>
<s> In other words, the networks seem to be working perfectly - I just can't browse them - and yesterday, they were browsing normally. </s>
<s> The nets are via Ethernet cards, mixed W98, Me, XP I'm curious if anyone else is noticing this, because I suspect a MS bug. </s>
<s> It happened to me in the last two days.. and have not resolved it yet. </s>
<s> I have several XP pro-sp1, XP pro-SP2, Win ME, Win 98se, connected via Ethernet LAN, ADSL Modem/Router + a couple of switches... (Latest MS Updates are Not installed in all XPs) -- that is the reason why I said its not MS Updates is the culprit.-- Everything works normally, then suddenly I can not browse the workgroup.. just like you described... '(network unavailable warning - yet the FIND command locates any computer on the net and grants access, as does the cd\\&lt;computername&gt; command.)' </s>
<s> Also printing via network is working normally. </s>
<s> -- So its not 'File and Printer sharing has been turn off too -- I would also like to know, if anyone know what is happening and how to solve the problem. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> In answer to your question... yes. </s>
<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> Last night all was well. </s>
<s> Today I could not acces my network. </s>
<s> I can get email over the network (via cable modem). </s>
<s> We have wireless (4) and wired - RJ45 cat5e/6 (6) systmes in our network. </s>
<s> Has worked fine for years. </s>
<s> Everyone has a version of XP (Pro, Home, Media. </s>
<s> I can use any previous links in Network Neighborhood work. </s>
<s> I can't even see my own shared drive on my computer. </s>
<s> If I use a previous link I can send files and run programs over the network. </s>
<s> If I try to click through on the same computer (My Network Places-&gt; Entire Network-&gt; Microsoft Windows Network-&gt; Workgroup Name) it says network unavailable. </s>
<s> Bull, I just used it through my prior link. </s>
<s> I tried to restore my system to a prior date but it did not fix the problem. </s>
<s> If anyone knows what to do I would love an answer. </s>
<s> I hate the idea of reformating my hard drive and starting all over again. </s>
<s> I had to use this wizard and share the directories before being able to access them in Network Places. </s>
<s> Also have to make sure that Logged in User has Network Admin Rights (I think)? </s>
