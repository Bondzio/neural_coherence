Thanks for all the fast replies guys!
OK, I found another PC on the market, so if you can tell me is this good?
Spec: CPU: AMD Phenom II X6-1055T 6-Core BOX RAM: DIMM 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1333MHz Apacer GPU: Gigabyte PCX GeForce GTX560Ti 1GB DDR5 HDMI/2xDVI Overclock HDD: 3.5&quot; 2TB Hitachi SATA3 64MB 7200RPM CASE: ATX Midi Tower Case Hantol 2881 POWER SUPPLY: PSU 685W Hantol Is this good?
The price is between the number 1 and number 2!
Is the CPU faster than the 2600k?
I emailed them and asked them how much Ghz is the CPU?
And how big the case is?
So umm, is this good?
-Thanks!
