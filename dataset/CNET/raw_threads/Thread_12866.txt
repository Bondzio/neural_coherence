I already know it makes it more accurate, but before I blow a hundred dollars on a mouse I want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother. I just bought a new graphics card (GTX 560 TI) and couldn't help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when I slide the mouse. When I run or aim I can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when I turn. It also looks a lot smoother with a controller. So can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher DPI mouse... or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there's no difference?

A mouse uses &quot;dpi rating&quot; in that it transverses the display it also counts on dpi to makes it movements. If not capable it will appear jerky or snappy, trying to catch-up. Also, since you have a better video grade you raise the level as all that follows must also be capable and/or measure-up. This is not normally a problem, but if you push the bounds, then expect it to push back because everything is suspect to an upgrade. What makes a $100 mouse, now you know and it may not always appear that way. At the same time, if the mouse needs extra attention it may suck some cpu cycles when you may need them for game play, then I'm not a gamer. Though, I fix many a gamer PC, only because they push them to the limits with a mix-match of PC parts, for what was the deal of the day purchase. No downplay on gamers, but if you want the best from your PC, then install the best into your PC. tada -----Willy

I borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out. Before I used a wireless mouse because I'm using it on a TV and across the room. It improved the performance about a thousand times. I've already ordered a Logitech G700 (5700 dpi) and hopefully it won't fail me because it's wireless as well...
