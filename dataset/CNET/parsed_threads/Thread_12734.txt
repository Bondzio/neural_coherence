<s> Hi everyone, I have a issue that I would like to get resolved. </s>
<s> I have minimal experience with capturing with this little handheld. </s>
<s> Anyways, I have some footage of my proposal of the hard drive on the camera and use Final Cut Studio 2 to do some hobby editing. </s>
<s> How can I capture the footage from the Sony HDR SR1 into Final Cut Pro 6? </s>
<s> Thank You and hope to hear from you soon. </s>
<s> Import from Camera? </s>
<s> (or similar) If that fails, import it into iMovie and then into FCS2. </s>
<s> Would have been nice had you told us what you had done so far to import the video. </s>
<s> With FCS2, one would assume that you were used to this sort of thing. </s>
<s> Note: If there are any still pictures on that camera drive, you will not be able to import the video. </s>
<s> Save the pictures, delete and then import. </s>
<s> P </s>
