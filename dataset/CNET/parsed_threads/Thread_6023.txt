<s> If you don't know what hpsetup is, it's the default name for an ad hoc wireless network connection. </s>
<s> It gets set up when you try and connect to a wireless printer or try to connect directly to someone else's PC. </s>
<s> It can be called anything but hpsetup seems to be the most common. </s>
<s> Ok...my question is WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE THIS RUNNING ALL THE TIME???? </s>
<s> I am just figuring out a problem with my conference rooms and WiFi. </s>
<s> It seems if you get two laptops broadcasting hpsetup, they sit there and crank out tons of RF apparently saying to each other &quot;Hey you want to connect? </s>
<s> No? </s>
<s> Ok how about now?&quot; Over and over. </s>
<s> That RF then gets picked up by the mics that are sitting directly in front of the laptops and it screws up the sound going to the other end. </s>
<s> This seem SO insecure. </s>
<s> Why is my IT department not freaking out? </s>
<s> It seems that if I had an open network connection broadcasting my MAC address all the time even with the lid closed in standby mode, that it could cause some issues. </s>
<s> I have done tests over the last few days and I can walk down the executive hallway and see about half of the laptops because they are broadcasting hpsetup. </s>
<s> Plus I can connect to the adhoc network without them ever knowing I did it. </s>
<s> Im not a hacker so I dont know what I can do, but Im sure one of you freaks could figure something out. </s>
<s> It just seems very strange. </s>
<s> Is there something I don't know? </s>
<s> What the heck else are people using this for? </s>
<s> safe computing all the time, hackers and internet security personnel would be unemployed would't they? </s>
