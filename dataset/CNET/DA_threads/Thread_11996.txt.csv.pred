1.1.1	I just bought a new Dell 9100 ( have n't hooked it up yet ) and I am wondering if I need to install the Norton Firewall software or not .	St
1.1.2	I am planning on buying the Anti virus , but wonder if I will need the firewall too .	St
1.1.3	If so is the Norton Security software good enough ?	Ques
1.1.4	I seen it on Ebay for $ 25 shipped .	St
1.1.5	Sorry for the simple question , but I do n't know alot about this sort of thing .	St
1.1.6	I only use dial up if that means anything .	St
1.1.7	Thank you	St
1.2.1	A firewall is your first line of defense ... it helps prevent viruses/trojans from ever being installed on your PC , from running/editing settings/causing problems , and from phoning-home with information it gathered ( including usernames , passwords , and credit card numbers ) .	St
1.2.2	Antivirus software , while it does help prevent the installing of malware to some degree , is only truly ment to remove the invaders ... after the damage may have been done .	St
1.2.3	While some might say that those on dial-up do n't need a firewall , I could n't disagree more .	St
1.2.4	While its true that those with & quot ; always-on & quot ; cable or DSL connections are more vulnerable ( you can be invaded faster due to the greater speed , and more frequently , as you 're online 24/7 ) , those on dial-up can still be hacked , and ths need protection just like everyone else .	St
1.2.5	Seven years ago , when I had dialup , I was hacked ... right through Norton Internet Security !	St
1.2.6	I switched to McAfee the next day and never had a problem .	St
1.2.7	( But I recently dropped McAfee when I found a better alternative . )	St
1.2.8	Windows XP comes with a built-in firewall , but it is very limited ... it only scans incoming data , not outgoing , and does n't catch nearly as much as third-party software .	St
1.2.9	Personally , I recommend ZoneAlarm Basic ( free ) .	St
1.2.10	Then , for antivirus , try Avast Antivirus 4 Home .	St
1.2.11	Believe it or not , these free programs provide better protection ( in my opinion ) than Norton , and do not hog system resources like Norton , which , along with McAfee , is known as & quot ; bloatware. & quot ; Then , of course , you can always upgrade to the Professional versions ( like I did ) for added protection/features .	St
1.2.12	Hope this helps , John P.S .	St
1.2.13	If the software is being sold on Ebay , I 'd be a little careful ... it may be pirated , damaged , etc .	St
1.2.14	Just make sure you know the risks prior to bidding .	Sug
1.3.1	Unfortunely , you need the firewall .	St
1.3.2	The good news is , there are *free* firewalls just as good as the commerical types .	St
1.3.3	They are Kerio , Zonealarm and SysGate to name a few , just google for them .	St
1.3.4	While Norton 's s/w is good , I try to shy away from it as when it starts to puke it tends to cause more problems plus its a resource hog , IMHO .	St
1.3.5	Up to you , though .	St
1.3.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I quit using Norton 2 years ago .	St
1.5.2	I now use AVG .	St
1.5.3	You can get the free version .	St
1.5.4	That 's what I started out with but I upgraded to the pay version .	St
1.5.5	I like it much better than Norton .	St
1.5.6	I also vote for Zone Alarm over XP firewall .	St
1.5.7	The XP firewall was probably turned on by default .	St
1.5.8	but check at Start/Control Panel/Security Center .	St
1.5.9	When you install Zone Alarm it will turn off the Windows firewall automatically .	St
