how should i go about doing this?do i delete everything(how?
)or just initialize,however i do that.i just bought this thing and tried to boot(do you still say boot?
)it from the instructions.how do i set up initializing the hd?i understand it's like talking to a child for you guys but it's all new to me.i'm learning a new language here and i was a disaster in french.i have an imac dual processor running 10 1 4.that's all i know except it's intel based.youre right about it being a mishmash of poorly functioning software.things are going wrong all the time.i really appreciate the help as i had no idea what a mess i'd made until i stumbled onto this site.
