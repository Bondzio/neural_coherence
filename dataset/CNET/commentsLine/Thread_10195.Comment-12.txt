high tech companies in general do not perform out-of-warranty hardware repairs on demand.
they do repairs for out-of-warranty hardware when the customer has purchased service contracts which are usually expensive.
since independent shops exist for repairs (in-warranty and out-of-warranty), go to them.
if the defective unit is under warranty, the vendor will pay for repairs.
i'm curious why you didn't ask the shop which serviced your printer to replace the memory.
