1.1.1	Hi , I have a 12 & quot ; G4 Powerbook ( 1.5 GHz PowerPC G4 , 512 MB DDR SDRAM ) running OS 10.3.9 , with one of those crap MATSHITA DVD-R UJ-835E Superdrives that I have n't had the cash to replace ( until now ) .	St
1.1.2	There are two places I 'm thinking of using : MacService ( www.macservice.com ) IResQ ( www.iresq.com ) Both companies install the Panasonic 8x dual layer , which I understand is what Apple also uses .	St
1.1.3	My questions : 1 ) Is the Panasonic as unreliable and prone to breakdown as I understand the Matshita to have been ?	Ques
1.1.4	2 ) Is there a better drive out there ?	Ques
1.1.5	I 've heard that Pioneer DVR-K05 is more reliable .	St
1.1.6	3 ) If you think I should just go with the Panasonic , do you have anything positive/negative to say about either of these companies ?	Sug
1.1.7	Thanks in advance for your help !	St
1.2.1	While you may call the UJ-835E carp I want to share with you a problem I see in the industry .	St
1.2.2	They did n't do a good job of relaying that all these low prices came at the cost of lower years of life in the products .	St
1.2.3	So I want to warn you that your replacement drive will likely last just as long as your UJ-835E .	St
1.2.4	That being said , I try to shop at the usual Mac outlets since they 'll get me the drive that will & quot ; just work. & quot ; I know I get to replace these things about every 1 to 3 years depending on a variety of factors .	St

1.3.1	Thanks , Bob .	St
1.3.2	You 're right on .	St
1.3.3	I think I 'm going with the Pioneer drive .	St
1.4.1	I hope I 've saved you from the RMA dance .	St
