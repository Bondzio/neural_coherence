my computer has started doing something odd.
it doesn't load &quot;num lock&quot; on boot.
i have to do it manually, or not be able to use the keypad(numbers,+/*,etc) on the right hand side of the keyboard.
while trivial, it is irritating.
i have found no way to change this short of re-installing the os.
it is a standard 101/102 ps/2 keyboard.
is this a sign of a dying keyboard?
doesn't seem likely.
while a dual-boot win 98se/mandrake 10 system, haven't been in linux lately to see if it is doing it there.
any ideas?
