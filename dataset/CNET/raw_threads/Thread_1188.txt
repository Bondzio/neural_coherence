Also that startup seems to be so low that I've seen those carts last a year even with multiple times on and off. Given the cx4300 is your typical 2 year lifetime printer why fret? Bob

I have a mono laser printer, but the CX4300 is also a copier/ scanner.The life of the printer has nothing to do with ink usage. I queried leaving leaving the printer running permanently. If you can't answer this, please do not post.
