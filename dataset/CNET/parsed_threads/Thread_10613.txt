<s> I have a 64MB SDRAM PC100 100MgHz on my Win98 pc and I tried to replace it with 256MB SDRAM PC133 168pin. </s>
<s> The problem is when I boot up my pc the screen starts to count up to 256MB then the screen becomes filled with coloured squares that are continuously flashing. </s>
<s> The brand of memory I purchased was AZENRAM. </s>
<s> Does anyone know the possible problem and how to solve it? </s>
<s> The memory is obviously not compatible with your system. </s>
<s> You should check with a company like Crucial (www.crucial.com) and put in the specifications of your system so you can get memory that is recommended. </s>
<s> Not all systems that use 100Mhz ram work with 133Mhz, most will, but not all. </s>
<s> Do try removing and reseating the memory as a final test before returning it. </s>
<s> Your description is typical of some machines I've seen with onboard video and a few others. </s>
<s> It's a sign the memory stick isn't compatible. </s>
<s> Just because it plugs in, doesn't mean it will work. </s>

<s> Thanks Guys, Now that I realize the memory I bought is incompatible. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any advice on how to figure out what type of memory I should buy? </s>
<s> doityourself </s>
<s> If its a brand name, look up crucial.com Your post neglected to share make/model/etc so no one can give a direct answer. </s>

<s> The machine is: Compaq Presario 7469 Win98 2nd Edition OS 64MB SDRAM PC100 100MgHz Bus Clock: 100MgHz Processor: 500MgHz AMD </s>
<s> That machine may need specific memory modules. </s>
<s> Look to vendors that have selectors that note your machine. </s>
