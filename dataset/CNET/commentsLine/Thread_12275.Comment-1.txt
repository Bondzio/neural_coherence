i have a motorola surfboard 6580 as my cable modem + router + 802.11n ap.
i wanted to add an ap on the second floor of the house for better signal.
i have read that aps from different manuafacturers are not necessarily compatible for seamless roaming.
i just want to see if anyone has experiences on it.
well, i guess the worst case is to turn off wifi on the surfboard and get 2 identical aps, but that's not ideal.
thanks for any suggestions.
