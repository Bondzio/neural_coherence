Ok, here's my problem, I think this is a sign but I don't know.
My Internet connection is not working as fast as it used to, and my other computer is a PC and it's working just fine, I feel like it is the wireless card in my laptop, because it connects ok, but when I hit Internet Explorer or Mozilla it lags and is very slow, any suggestions on how to fix this, or any updates I should know about, here are my system specs: Dell Inspiron 6000 2.0 GB RAM 50 GB HD Space Intel(R) Proset/Wireless Card, Windows Version 9.0.4.33 Windows XP Media Center Edition
