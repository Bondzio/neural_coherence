everyone's talking about duplexing on the 8560, i'm trying mine out, and the ink keeps flaking off the newly-printed side on any print quality setting.
it is slightly reduced by using the &quot;normal&quot; setting, but that doesn't give me good ink coverage or photo color.
i'm trying to print double-sided on the stardream card stock.
i've tried putting the setting on &quot;2nd side&quot; as well, but no real change.
anyone had this happen?
