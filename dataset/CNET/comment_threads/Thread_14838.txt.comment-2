If you mean &quot;doesn't show in My Computer and Windows Explorer&quot;, there are 2 possibilities: 1.
See if it comes up in Disk Management.
That means the fileystem is damaged somehow.
Delete the partition(s) on the drive, make a new one and format it.
2.
If it doesn't even show in Disk Management on several machines it's broken.
Throw it away then.
