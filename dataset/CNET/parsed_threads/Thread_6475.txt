<s> I recently got an IDE HDD back that I lent to my mate a while back, and have bought an external case for it from eBay. </s>
<s> I put it in the case, plugged it in correctly, and it wouldn't recognise. </s>
<s> Trying to fix this, I took out the drive and connected it directly to my PC via a SATA cable. </s>
<s> I reformatted the drive and created a single volume on it. </s>
<s> I put the drive back into the case, and it still won't recognise... [I am sure there's power getting to the drive.] </s>
<s> Any help // suggestions? </s>
<s> If other external USB HARD DISKS work then this case is bad. </s>

<s> it cannot recognize the drive capacity you are putting in the case. </s>
<s> The latter shouldn't be a problem but it could. </s>
<s> In either case it's not working and should be returned. </s>

<s> Tried the drive in a better quality case this morning [Vantec]. </s>
<s> Suppose I get what I paid for with that eBay one, $20... </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
