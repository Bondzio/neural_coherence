Hello All, I was just wondering which filesystem is best for DVD burning.
CDBurnerXP pro offers 3 files systems, namely Joliet, ISO-level 1 and ISO-level 2.
I found from Wikipedia that Joliet is Microsoft endorsed file system but if I am making DVD back-ups which file system I should go for?
that will run on PC, Mac as well as Linux.
Many thanks
