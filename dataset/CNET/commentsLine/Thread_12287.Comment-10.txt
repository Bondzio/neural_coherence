if you have a cabinet around you, drawer, etc & you want big booming bass, put the subwoofer in the cabinet, drawer, etc.
it will resonate the entire container...really amplifies the uph of any subwoofer, so long as you dont get any rattles.
thats what i did.
also, windows xp comes w/ a lil known program that you can access through the control panel (cant remember the name) but its a blue icon w/ a yellow cirle on it.
check it out, it allows you to turn your standard output/line-in/mic plugs into a full surround sound system sub & all check it out.
this is all stuff that i have done & i have a humongous 29 speaker surround sound setup connected to my computer
