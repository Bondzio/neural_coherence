<s> I posted this on a different forum and then came across the networking forum- any help would be appreciated thanks: &quot;I have two computers, and I use Linksys B wireless broadband router to connect Computer #2 to the internet from Computer #1. </s>
<s> Comp #1 is my primary cpu and I do not use Comp #2 that often. </s>
<s> I am going to be purchasing a new printer primarily for photos and will connect it to Comp #1 and take my old printer and use it with Comp #2. </s>
<s> Now, Comp #2 is on a different level on the house. </s>
<s> I plan on networking the two computers, so I can send a print job (documents etc.) </s>
<s> to the comp #2 printer. </s>
<s> Here is my question- is it possible to have the computer in power save mode and still send a print job to the computer? </s>
<s> By sending a print job, will the computer wake up and then print?? </s>
<s> My printer turns on by itself when a print job is sent to the printer. </s>
<s> Since I use Comp #2 very infrequently, I don't want to keep it on all the time- I would prefer to leave it on powersave mode. </s>
<s> Is what I am suggesting on doing feasible??? </s>
<s> I've never really networked computers except for internet access so I am very naive in this area. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help and suggestions!&quot; </s>
<s> Unless the OS is running on the remote PC, it's not going to be able to respond automatically to a print command but I'm not sure what you mean by power saving mode. </s>
<s> Anything like standby or hibernate is not going to work. </s>
<s> It might be possible use a WOL (wake on LAN) scheme but these are rather tricky and, in my limited experience with them, a bit flaky too...that's the best I can describe these as I've only used them with NAS hardware. </s>
<s> You can certainly just turn off the monitor and leave the PC running...perhaps even allow the HD to power down, but I have to wonder if another option might be just to use a network print server. </s>
<s> The downside of these is finding compatibility between printer and server. </s>
<s> They don't all work gracefully. </s>
<s> But, if that's an option, you can leave the other PC off and it will still have access to the printer when you do turn it on. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> By power saving mode, I really meant sleep mode. </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, can I send a print job to the computer when it is off, or in sleep mode and then print it when I wake or turn the computer on? </s>
<s> I am still not even sure how I network computers so I am probably jumping the gun here- but this is the reason why i want to network- so I would want to make sure it is possible before I go through the work of trying to figure out how to network. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> It may remain as a pending print job from the originating PC and keep trying but this might tie up other print processes. </s>
<s> So, no, sending a print job to a sleeping PC isn't going to work. </s>
<s> It needs to be on and ready to act as a print server. </s>
<s> Again, a network type print server is another option but you need to check printer compatibility with these first. </s>
<s> If you put together a network and want to share printers, having the printers on the network via servers (external or internal) is really the best way to go. </s>
<s> BTW, you'd still need to have your printer turned on using the remote PC as a server and it would be consuming a small bit of power anyway. </s>
