did you get your burner to work?
i replaced the cd burner with hp dvd840ri and now my 2004 compaq presario s5200nx (2.7ghz processor, 512mb memory,120gb hard drive) thinks the dvd burner is a cd burner.i have xp home.i've tried everything short of a different burner.
i don't like the nero program and want to use dvd architect.
any suggestions?
