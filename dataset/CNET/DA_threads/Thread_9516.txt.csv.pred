1.1.1	After spending several hours researching the archives Im ready to buy a DVD+Ram burner .	St
1.1.2	Searching my price range ( $ 50.00 ) I have found three brands im contemplating on .	St
1.1.3	1 ) -Asus 2 ) -BenQ 3 ) -LG Any users input as to pros or cons would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.1.4	I dont minding spending up to $ 100.00 if its really worth it so im open to other options as well .	St
1.1.5	Also many thanks to those hundreds of responses ( especially those including links to great spec sites ) covering everything I needed to know about DVD burners and thanks to CNET for its comprehensive ( 19 pages ) ''Burner Buying Guide '' !	St
1.1.6	Looking at other posts I plan on checking out Toshiba and NEC burners as well but absolutely want one that burns DVD Ram as my first priority is for my C drive back up .	St
1.1.7	Many thanks , Ken Ps : Whats the scoop on making sure I get drivers and software w/purchase ?	Ques
1.1.8	I read that some units do not come with these ?	Ques
1.1.9	( OEM bulk units ) ?	Ques
1.1.10	I understand the concept and wondering if I should make sure what I do and dont get w/purchase .	St
1.1.11	Will I need a cable as im replacing my CDRom with the new burner ( as the master ) and keeping my CD burner/DVD Rom as a slave .	St
1.2.1	No matter which I 've put in at home or office , they all seem to peter out after a few years .	St
1.2.2	At least the sub 50 dollar units are not a big bite in the budget anymore .	St
1.2.3	I will share that I always record at 1/2 the rated media speed .	St
1.2.4	I do n't want to debate why but feel it 's a key reason why I have so few problems .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I did read your reply elsewhere about burning at 1/2 speed .	St
1.3.2	Makes sense to me and when I burn im in no hurry anyway .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the heads up on that idea .	St
1.3.4	Mostly just wondering if anyone here has any pros or cons on brands LG , Asus , and Benq .	St
1.3.5	As I have found these 3 at comparable prices .	St
1.3.6	I will head back to the stores online review panel for more input .	St
1.3.7	BTW I did read here somewhere that someone said they did not have a problem w/less costly blank media for burning DVD Ram .	St
1.3.8	ie : Ram is not as picky as to which brand of media as compared to DVD R/RW media in general .	St
1.3.9	I ask because I have found blank Ram media from $ 14.00 each ( Memorex ) to $ 6.00 each ( unknown name ) both not in the cartridge form .	St
1.3.10	I did read a review on the more expensive Memorex label from a office tech who has used them exclusively for years witn never a single problem .	St
1.3.11	Thanks again , Ken	St
1.4.1	http : //www.cdspeed2000.com/ has some DVD test results .	St
1.4.2	The brands you listed are all quite common and I would buy , use such at the 50 buck mark .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	it 's still humming along .	St
1.7.1	Thanks but I want one that writes to DVD Ram which I havent found in NEC .	St
1.7.2	At least not in the price range of $ 50.00 .	St
1.7.3	Ken	St
1.8.1	I have my eye on a BenQ # DQ60 .	St
1.8.2	I found it for under $ 50.00 and it does everything I want .	St
1.8.3	Its also one of the few that will work with a slower processor .	St
1.8.4	( and the site I found it at offers free shipping ) Thanks , Ken	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Other than packaging what is the difference between OEM and Retail units ?	Ques
1.10.2	Also can the software for a burner be installed on an external HD and use that Hd 's storage room for operating the burner ?	Ques
1.10.3	The unit im looking at needs a min .	St
1.10.4	( .5G ) processor where as most of the others need a min .	St
1.10.5	1.2G speed .	St
1.10.6	What will this affect ?	Ques
1.10.7	My old computer which im on now is only a small .5G processor with a 6G HD so im wondering if I can use the extra space on my external HD .	St
1.10.8	I have a more recent unit which had a fatal crash and I havent restored it yet as I need to start from scratch but its bigger and faster .	St
1.10.9	( many lessons learned ! )	St
1.10.10	Do I need to wait untill I get my better computer back up and running ?	Ques
1.10.11	Thanks again , Ken	St
1.11.1	I would wait until the newer is fixed .	St
1.11.2	Depending on the crash , ( software or hardware ) you could either piece together the bad components with your other computer - or use your reboot disc - if software , to reinstall windows .	St
1.11.3	It is really easy to do with XP , but you will lose all your files .	St
1.12.1	Lite On seemed to be high up on performance according to your link .	St
1.12.2	Anyone willing to share experience with them .	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	My internal CD-RW drive was fried recently during a power surge , so I went to Walmart to replace it , shopping for , at minimum , just a CD-Rom drive .	St
1.14.2	The Lite-On DVD +/- RW SOHW-1693S was just $ 59 , so I purchased that .	St
1.14.3	( By the way , the same drive is just $ 44.99 at thetechgeek.com ) .	St
1.14.4	I have a dual boot with Windows ME and XP on an IBM Net Vista 850 mhz Pentium III .	St
1.14.5	My video capture device is a Belkin USB Video Bus .	St
1.14.6	I also have an Intel Pocket PC Camera attached by USB .	St
1.14.7	Whenever I try to capture video with my Nero software , I get a & quot ; blue screen of death & quot ; that flashes on the screen for about 2 seconds saying something about not enough memory .	St
1.14.8	So , if the purpose of your getting a DVD burner is to capture video , your limited memory may be an issue .	St
1.14.9	For capturing video , the standalone DVD recorders attached directly to your cable system/dvr/TV are much better .	St
1.14.10	I also have a $ 98 ILO DVD recorder which I got at Walmart , and it 's so much easier than using the Nero software that comes with the LiteOn DVD burner ... no 'blue screens of death ' .	St
1.14.11	But if you are just wanting to use it to burn data , the LiteOn DVD burner is very good from my experience with it so far .	St
1.14.12	It also plays back DVD in the formats burned from my ILO DVD recorder .	St
1.15.1	NIL	St
1.16.1	I use limewire , and I wish to burn to DVD to watch on a bigger screen .	St
1.16.2	Any suggestions on software/burners ?	Ques
1.16.3	Thanks	Polite
