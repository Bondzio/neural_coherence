well ok - didn't know there was such a thing.
i'll check it out.
thanks.
re your reference to permissions, etc - i wouldn't think that would be the problem since it was working before, and none of that was changed (unless something in a windows update changed them - they change all kinds of stuff...arrggh).
thanks for your time.
