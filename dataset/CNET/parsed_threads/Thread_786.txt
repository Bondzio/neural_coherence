<s> Hi guy's/ PC hardware Guru's. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt;Ok so I'm trying to build a new computer for the first time to play DCS and Battlefield 3 among others. </s>
<s> At the time of buying my last computer I was quite up to date with computer hardware as in i told the shop what i wanted and they made it..... however, not any more. </s>
<s> Please excuse my lack of understanding in this topic. </s>
<s> So this is what I'm thinking so far: Not a complete list yet. </s>
<s> maximus iv gene-z motherboard intel 2600K @3.40 GHz, 8MB Cache processor Nvida Geforce GTX 570 graphics card 8GB Kingston Hyper-x Genesis dual DDR3 1600MHz RAM 500GB WD5002AALX SATA 6 Gb/s, Hard drive CORSAIR 750W TX750 V2-80 PSU My current PC spec is: Intel Quad Core Q8300 @2.5GHz Processor 500 gig SATA - 7200rpm Hard drive 4 gig DDR2 RAM Asrock 4core 1600 GLAN Motherboard 1 gig nvida geforce 9800gt Graphics Card 620 WATT PSU My first question is: Can i rip any parts out of my old pc to use in the new one? </s>
<s> I'm thinking that PSU is worth swapping but I don't know if it's compatible or will supply enough juice. </s>
<s> And that hard drive looks good to swap but its slowly dying of old age so i think il bin it. </s>
<s> Second question: im not exactly the best with PC hardware or the pricing of it either... so can you see any improvements that are worth while, or any errors i've made in compatibility? </s>
<s> And finally: can you suggest any compromises to save money? </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your time. </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> Suggestions.....add links to the products to ensure we're looking at the right products...even if you don't plan to buy there, Newegg has good selection, product description and buyer comments. </s>
<s> Re reusable components... </s>
<s> I don't see much to move to the new system. </s>
<s> What 620W PSU are you referring to and how old is it ? </s>
<s> Perhaps you could use the old HDD as a backup. </s>
