<s> Hello -- I really want to upgrade my old PIII 700mhz dell computer. </s>
<s> I know that most I can jack it up to is 1ghz, but that's fine. </s>
<s> My issue is that my computer uses a 100 FSB, and the 100fsb model of the processor is more rare (and expensive) than the 133mhz. </s>
<s> Can I put a different FSB-speed CPU in my computer? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> might as well save up for a new pc </s>
<s> Don't, as the above says time for a new PC. </s>
