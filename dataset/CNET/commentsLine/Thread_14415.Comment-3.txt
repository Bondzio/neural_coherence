from microsoft... i would imagine the 2nd to last paragraph is where your issue is.
open network connections.
(click start, click control panel, and then doubleclick network connections.)
click the dialup, local area network, pppoe, or vpn connection you want to share, and then, under network tasks, click change settings of this connection.
on the advanced tab, select the allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection check box.
if you want this connection to dial automatically when another computer on your home or small office network attempts to access external resources, select the establish a dialup connection whenever a computer on my network attempts to access the internet check box.
if you want other network users to enable or disable the shared internet connection, select the allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection check box.
