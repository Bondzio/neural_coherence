I'm finding out only by physically looking(hard way) at USB what &quot;they&quot; mean by USB.
In some cases it's not the generic USB port as found on a PC.
The mini-USB or somehow differently *shaped* USB port takes only what the maker supplied or specific to that brand.
While the other end that connects to PC for sync is OK, it's the tablet port that causes all the fun.
I've started not to like tablets since you can't crack them open anyways(easily) or is it worth it.
