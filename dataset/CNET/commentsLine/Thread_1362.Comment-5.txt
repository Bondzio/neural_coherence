heat will be one factor, so putting it on blocks will help air circulation and cooling.
sixteen hours a day of use, will be about 100 per week, which is about 5,000 per year.
normal office useage will be less than 2,000 per year; so your drive will last less than half as long.
i haven't got a spec with me but 10,000 hours rings a bell for long life electroic products.
two years should see you through a hard drive if you leave it on all the time - and of course, longer hours of use will reduce its lifetime anyway (wear the same socks for a few weeks and they fall appart).
you could try having an alternate drive, so you aren't using the same one day after day - change drives every time you change socks and see which lasts longest
