1.1.1	Hi - I use my PC for everything from music creation (no great graphics requirement) to playing games (obviously, this is where things get more demanding).	St
1.1.2	I recently fitted an Nvidea GS7800 card which offers a maximum screen display of 1600 x 1200 (I currently have my 19&quot; CRT monitor set to 1280 x 960, which suits my purposes.	St
1.1.3	Games seem to offer a choice of resolution settings, but invariably have their own native setting which imposes itself, which is fine with my CRT.	St
1.1.4	However, I fancy replacing my 19&quot; CRT with a - you guessed it!	St
1.1.5	- larger LCD monitor.... From googling around, I see that there are 21 and 22-inch LCD monitors which seem very attractive, but depending on their format (i.e.	St
1.1.6	how widescreen they are) they max out at either 1600 x 1200 (perfect for my needs?)	St
1.1.7	or 1680 x 1050 ( a more widescreen format?).	St
1.1.8	Am I confined to monitors with 1600 x 1200 or can I still consider 1680 x 1050 with my current graphics card?	St
1.1.9	Also, is it likely that my games will find their own resolution whatever the monitor size?	St
1.1.10	I am not too clear about how LCD technology works under these conditions and would appreciate any advice.	St
1.1.11	Incidentally, how important is a really fast response time of, say 2ms, when it comes to gaming?	St
1.1.12	Will 5ms not do just as well?	St
1.1.13	I understand that measuring systems vary a lot, even within one make of monitor.	St
1.1.14	A number of points here, I know, but if they could be addressed individually or together that would be much appreciated (in fact if anyone can recommend a monitor that would work with my card then great!)	St
1.2.1	I took the simple MATH approach but it appears the makers lie about the numbers.	St
1.2.2	See what you think at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-10152_102-0.html?forumID=97&threadID=266305&messageID=2596675#2596675 Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for that.	St
1.3.2	It seems likely that quoted figured of 2ms are misleading...	St
1.3.3	Anyone got anything on screen resolution?	St
1.3.4	Any monitor recommendations?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I would be interested in hearing more discussion on the issues of LCD monitor screen size/resolution, as in my original post.	St
1.6.1	I have always found that resolution plays a part, however, refresh rates are just as important.	St
1.7.1	I have a Viewsonic 22&quot; widescreen multimedia LCD with a 7600GS graphics card and the games look and run very good with that combination.	St
1.7.2	As far as response time I could not see any difference with the 5ms response on the Viewsonic and the 2ms on the Samsung that I used for 2 weeks while the Viewsonic was being delevered.	St
1.7.3	I set the resolution at 1680 X 1050 and it looks great in very day use and also games.	St
1.7.4	The only thing I will be doing to improve gaming is installing a bigger power supply and a better, newer graphics card as that seems to be the key with the newer direct 10X games	St
1.8.1	Thanks for that useful advice!	St
