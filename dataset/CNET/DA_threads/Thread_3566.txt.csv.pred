1.1.1	I work on my computer usally 12 to 17 hours or more each day .	St
1.1.2	Currently I use a CRT monitor that is about 3 years old .	St
1.1.3	I really would like to update and get something nicer , and newer , but really not sure what is going to work the best and cause the least amount of strain .	St
1.1.4	I plan to purchase my monitor when I build my computer with HP .	St
1.1.5	So , I was looking at the 19 inch VS19D I think that a 21 inch is a little more than I need .	St
1.1.6	I like this particluar model because of the size and I also prefer having my speakers attached .	St
1.1.7	Is a flat panel monitor going to work good for me .	St
1.1.8	I know I have heard in the past that they are n't good for extended use and such .	St
1.1.9	Is there something else I should be looking into ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	... have n't you ?	Ques
1.2.2	Because TFT screens have a conintual glow from the backlight ( s ) , they do not suffer from refresh flicker in the way CRT 's do .	St
1.2.3	You can effectively use a terrible 60Hz refresh rate on a flat TFT , and see no flicker at all , where this is often noticeable on a CRT especially if you view peripherally , and easily is the biggest cause of eye strain .	St
1.2.4	The problems for TFT monitors is with response times .	St
1.2.5	This is basically how quickly the pixels that make up the display can flicker through various stages and positions .	St
1.2.6	If it 's slow enough , you see ghostly images as things move .	St
1.2.7	If you buy a cheap old tech one with a very slow response time , even scrolling up and down on a webpage blurs the lettering .	St
1.2.8	This is n't easy on the eye at all , and can be a headache to even find the mouse pointer on occasion .	St
1.2.9	This has largely been addressed by TFT 's in the last couple of years as response times of 20ms and lower are now virtually standard ( excluding Sony ) .	St
1.2.10	The closest CRT 's have to this is a low screen refresh rate , which you could always raise to fix , but you ca n't do anything if you buy a slow response TFT .	St
1.2.11	That 's it , you 're stuck with it .	St
1.2.12	By far and away the biggest confusion for TFT is something which is termed it 's ''native resolution '' .	St
1.2.13	Because a TFT screen is made up of a absolutely fixed number of indivdidual pixels wide and high , this is the one resolution it works perfectly at .	St
1.2.14	You can use other choices if you wish , but things go a bit odd looking , for obvious reasons .	St
1.2.15	Keeping numbers small ( multiply by 100 if you feel the need ! )	St
1.2.16	imagine you bought a TFT with 16 x 12 pixel display .	St
1.2.17	You use a graphics card setting of 16 x 12 , as each pixel provided by the card corresponds to a single pixel in the TFT .	St
1.2.18	This 16 x 12 is it 's ''native resolution '' .	St
1.2.19	If you change graphics resolution to 10 x 8 though ... .well problems start to appear , as the monitor now has to spread the 10 pixel width out over the 16 in the display , and the same to the 8 high , which do n't divide equally into 12 .	St
1.2.20	So what the monitor does is some graphic pixels will be sent to singles on the monitor , and some are sent to a couple of pixels ( it 's trying to spread them out evenly , which is impossible ) ... .this leads to odd looking fonts especially .	St
1.2.21	So the first thing you have to consider if you buy a TFT is , get one with a good fast response time that has no apparent blurring issues , and buy a size that has the ''native resolution '' you intend to use .	St
1.2.22	It 's no good if you buy a 19 '' TFT that has a native res of 1240 x 1024 if you plan to use an 800 x 600 res .	St
1.2.23	The graphics diplay and the monitor 's native resolution just are n't equally dividable .	St
1.2.24	However , one with a 1600x1200 native res , can obviously deal with 800x600 just fine .	St
1.2.25	Each graphics pixel would be displayed on 4 pixels ( twice as high x twice as wide ) on the monitor .	St
1.2.26	With that all said and done , you can read more on sites like : http : //www.techdot.com/doc/00169.html http : //www.p2btech.com/lcdvscrt.html http : //www.emedialive.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx ? ArticleID=4840 or ; www.google.com : lcd vs crt Good luck , GeeBee .	St
1.3.1	..the same question on a few of the forum areas , and I 'll waste my time answering the one here !	St
1.3.2	I do n't even know why I bother anymore ! ? !	Ques
1.3.3	GB .	St
1.4.1	I think you 're right .	Res
1.4.2	I had my thinking backwards .	St
1.4.3	But I swore I had heard that a few years ago .	St
1.4.4	Your answer was really helpful , though probably a little too advanced for my good Never the less , everything I needed to know .	St
1.4.5	Sorry about the double post .	St
1.4.6	I originally posted this last night and did n't get any responses , so I was thinking I had put it in the wrong forum ( I 've done this before ) So I decided to repost .	St
1.4.7	Thanks again !	St
