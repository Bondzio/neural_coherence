Like all other wireless thats out there in the market...these are 'interchangable', and will connect to eachother...but only as fast as the slowest component. Just like if you have a B wireless WAP with a G network card...you would only go as fast as the B network would go. If you get a Super G wireless card, in a regular G enviorment, you can only get up to 54 Mbs. Same thing with your MiMo and Pre-N. You can get them connected, but you would get the performance of the MiMo, and not the Pre-N. So, to make this answer simple.....YES. You can get the connected. Hope that answers your question and good luck.
