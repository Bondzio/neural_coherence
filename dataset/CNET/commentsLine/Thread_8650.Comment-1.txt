i just downloaded and used `speed fan' because i was concerned with the heat rising from the top of my rig.
a blackbird 002 01b.
the cpu and other temps are at 41c.
the ram is at 75c.
the ram is not liquid cooled and i believe this could be a fatal flaw in the design.
any ideas on this kind of thing?
seems like hp/voodoo did not quite get their homework right.
i could put the dominator ram fans in there, but this should be hp`s responsability.
thanks
