4098	0	313684	2891347	NR	psaulm119	10/25/08 11:11 AM	1.22493306E12	laptop shutting down at odd times	This morning I've noticed my Inspiron 1501 shutting down 3 or 4 times now without any cause on my part--no programs freezing, etc. I will hear a slight click and then everything shuts down. I keep the adapter plugged in all the time (it reads &quot;on AC power&quot;), and yes the adapter has a green light. Battery is at 100% power right now, has been all morning. This is the first time this has happened, and the laptop is only a year and a half old. The laptop is sitting on 3 coasters, strategically placed away from vents; I felt the bottom of the laptop and it was only mildly warm--its been very hot before (which is the reason for the coaster trick). Sorry if this has been covered before--for some reason the internet connection right now is horrid--2-3 minute page loads so I decided to skip searching.

I can unscrew these things---I've replaced quite a few keyboards in my day so I've got some experience in doing that--but I wouldn't know what was the CPU and what wasn't. I'll see if I can find a can of compressed air and hit the vents.

There were instructions on how to take out the RAM, the battery, modem, one or two other things but not the CPU or fan. I did try to just take off the bottom plastic tray that the innards sit on, but after taking out all the screws I could see it still wouldn't pop off so I'm not too sure how to manage that. Did a Malwarebytes scan (full scan, updated and booted into safe mode) and it found nothing. I was thinking it might be malware, b/c two of the times earlier when it shut down, I was in the middle of an av scan... that of course could be coincidence.

Malwarebytes actually found 2 infected files, both in Filezilla ftp client--something called RogueInstantAccess. one was in the Program Files directory, the other might have been in the registry but I'm not sure. MWB website didn't have much on this, dating its first instance to this month. I sure haven't d/l any rogue antispyware or anything like that. I hope it didn't jsut assume that something in my ftp client was malware. I never use it but if it goofs up I can always reinstall OK HJT log comes next.

Any &quot;no file&quot; line can be removed as it's dead leftovers from some pest or bad uninstall. 2. You have Copernic installed. For years I've had run into &quot;really weird issues&quot; with that. Your choice to toss but I always toss it out when a machine is misbehaving. 3. You also have Google Desktop and AskJeeves which works most of the time but then again you have Copernic installed as well. I'd toss all of them for now. 4. TWO clipboard programs? Sadly everytime you see more than one of any ilk program you toss both until you get stable. 5. TClockEx = OPTIONAL. Toss till we get stable. 6. Windows Messenger. Optional. Toss and kill for good measure until we get stable. 7. I see Avast, McFreeScan Class and Symantec AntiVirus scanner entries. Again, when you run more that 1 AV products you are asking for trouble. Make a choice here. 8. RoxMediaDB9. Iffy but I have had machines blue screen on this. While I know why, it's nothing I can fix and Roxio as well as MS will have to tackle that issue someday which they haven't so far. 9. Roxio Hard Drive Watcher 9. This is the second part I see bluescreens on. 10. Dell Wireless WLAN Tray Service and Broadcom Wireless Manager UI. I'd research which to use here. Having two can create issues and more. 11. Launchy. No real issue but as the machine is crashing we eject all optional items till we get stable. That's a lot to ponder but you can clean it up if you want. Bob
4098	16	313684	2891868	2891347	psaulm119	10/26/08 7:58 AM	1.22500788E12	Progress on programs with HJT	Oh man that's a lot to ask. Launchy has not been optional since I installed that program! OK lemme clear things up I don't want anyone thinking I'm a dork--- those av programs are for online, on demand scanning. Avast is the only malware ap that runs in the background. Likewise the only desktop search that has been running in the background is Google's. I'm not entirely happy with any of them but I like Google's best. OK back to serious stuff. I uninstalled Ask and Copernic, Roxio, and got Google Desktop search, Launchy, and xNeat Clipboard not to start up. I had already uninstalled PureText clipboard manager. Actually I have another one that didn't appear on the list(Ditto) but as you might guess by now it doesn't run in the background--I uninstalled that one also. I uninstalled TClockEx as well. I uninstalled Windows Messenger via the Add-Remove Programs windows components menu. I will uninstall Dell's Wireless (which wasn't managing my connection anyways) when I'm at school and I can verify that I can get online without it. OK Launchy, xNeat and GDS are still installed but do not start with Windows--unless you were suggesting to uninstall the entire lot?
4098	17	313684	2891870	2891868	R. Proffitt	10/26/08 8:05 AM	1.2250083E12	Why I noted all these.	Your choice here! But whenever I want to get a stable machine we eject, uninstall, erase, remove, obliterate, incarcerate and do whatever we need to remove all signs of such things. Once we get stable we can always restore such. But the biggest offender I see is where we mix and match antivirus products from various makers. I can't count how many times I see a lockup. -&gt; Again all this is your choice. I'm only sharing how I proceed and when it goes stable then we install just what we alsolutely need. Be sure to distinguish wants from needs. Bob
4098	18	313684	2891886	2891870	psaulm119	10/26/08 8:47 AM	1.22501082E12	Fair enough	As far as the av online scans are concerned, I googled and found ways to uninstall their programs (that are d/l and installed) but not any of the virus definitions and active-x controls that are installed for these online scans--apart from one link to such a tool for mcaffee was broken. OK I'll uninstall launchy and that other gunk, except GDS which I will keep on but not running or starting up with Windows. I do a lot of work on my laptop planning lectures and I need access to the information on the hdd. If I notice this occurring in the future (I plan on getting a cooling pad between now and Christmas) I'll uninstall GDS also. OK I'm trying to work the hardware angle on another forum. I have run Dell's diagnostics from the cd (I wiped out the diagnostics partition already) and it said that all my hardware passed the test. Yesterday morning I had 3 or 4 shutdowns, 2 or 3 when I was running malware scans. I haven't had anything since Malwarebytes cleaned up that (false positive?) file--and its been for over 12 hours or so since that time. I'd still appreciate some info on getting into the innards (if that is in fact advisable). Now that I have that compressed air can out I'd like to give it a shot.

There were several links on the page you linked to-- the first one was the OWNER'S manual (which I do have), the last was the SERVICE manual. I just decided that they were different formats of the same document. Ayways, the service manual has instructions for this. I'll get this taken care of later today and see what shape the fan/cpu are in.

I was told by re-sellers of computers that this was the best thing to do. Later I found out the exact opposite is the case--that you should keep it plugged in whenever possible and try not to drain it from 100 to 10 percent or whatever. Others here can verify (or refute) that, but how the laptop is powered should have some say in the life of the battery.

I was really hoping there would be more (so it would be a definite cause of the problems I was having yesterday AM), so I wouldn't feel like I had wasted an afternoon. At any rate, I did a quick diagnostic from Dell's cd and everything was good, so I must not have misplaced too many of the screws from inside the laptop. Well between the malware scans and the dusting and the programs, I'm sure this laptop will be ok. I'll post back if I get any more issues.

Run the Processor check and minimize the app...the app will minimize to the system tray and the CPU info speed, temp, voltage, etc., will remain on the screen in the upper right hand corner. Check the CPU TEMPs as you run the PC and see what it shows just to get a sense of how hot it's running. Good Luck. VAPCMD
