a thermal pad???
either way it shoul;d be thoroughly cleaned of from both surfaces.
if you make certain that the cleaning solvent only touches the heat sink base and the heat spreasder of the cpu, you could any mild remover product.
i simply do not recall that the bracket is difficult to remove when the black lever(s) [i remember two]are released.
with the mobo mounted in the case there is no support behind it, thus remove the mobo from the case and lay it on a piece of cardboard and the black antistatic pad that came with it.
that'll cushion the mobo so you won't damage it, if you really have to push that hard.
