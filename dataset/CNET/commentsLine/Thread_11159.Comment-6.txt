so even the bus is alot slower on the radeon 7200 that i have it will still perform alot better than an intel740 that is agp 2x?
what i basicly thought was that any agp cards will beat pci cards since like agp 2x is 533 mbps and pci cards are 133 mbps.
there is a difference you know.
if the intel740 had agp 8x then that would even be faster and better than radeon 7200pci right?
if there are others that are looking at this topic please reply back if you know about this.
thank you
