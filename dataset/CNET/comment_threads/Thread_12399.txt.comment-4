I think I see it's a Toshiba Satellite but with over a decade of models I can't say all will accept this drive.
As to the software, you dont have to buy that.
It's only needed for playing Blu ray discs.

Sorry if this upsets anyone.
But without the model or better yet a link to the model's home page you will have to figure it out.
