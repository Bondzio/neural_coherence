Since you give no information regarding your computer or the remote one, and since you appear to NOT be able to get into the remote one, I have to assume that you aren't the one who set up the remote computer and therefore you are attempting to do something you aren't supposed to be doing in the first place. This identical thread in the XP Forum has been locked I would think because it appears you want help to hack or spy on somebody else's computer, and CNET doesn't advocate this type of practice. So this thread will also be locked soon, giving you a chance to explain your actions before help will be given to you. TONI
