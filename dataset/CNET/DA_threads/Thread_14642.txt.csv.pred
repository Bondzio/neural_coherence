1.1.1	i got a RADEON X-700 PRO for my birthday the other day but is that the best card for for the price?	St
1.1.2	i have been looking around on this site, but just can't make up my mind... what other cards are good or better and what can $50 extra give me?	St
1.1.3	thanks.	St
1.2.1	HIS Radeon X1300Pro Platinum PCIe 256MB(Model H130PRP256; GPU RV515PRO; GPU frecv.	St
1.2.2	600 MHz; mem:256 MB(DDR2); bus 128 bits; memory frecv:800 MHz; DirectX 9.0c; VGA Output; TV Output; DVI Output; RAMDAC 400 MHz; passive cooling.	St
1.2.3	For the price you seek this is the best you can get.	St
1.2.4	And much more, you will have support for the last optimizations in games.	St
1.2.5	(sorry for my english)	St
1.3.1	You can get a X1300Pro cheaper but for around the same price as the X700Pro go for the X1600Pro.	St
1.3.2	The X1600Pro is comparable to a 6600GT, if not better.	St
1.3.3	My X1300Pro plays Call of Duty 2, BF2, Half-life 2, Age of Empires 3, and more on medium settings with no noticeable lag.	St
1.3.4	The X1600Pro will be even better with 12 pixel pipelines and a higher clock.	St
1.3.5	However I'd buy this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130263 $99 after $30 rebate.	St
1.3.6	Just look around at newegg.com and set yourself a budget and see what's the best deal.	St
