<s> I just built this computer. </s>
<s> Specs are below: AMD Athlon 64 3000+ socket 939 MSI Neo2 Platinum socket 939 Corsair XMS Twinx 2x512 ddr400 1024C2PT Leadtek Gefore 6800 GT TDH a400 GT Lite on CD-RW + DVD-rom Mitsumi Floppy Hitachi Desktar 60gb hard drive ata100 ALL up to date drivers + bios ver 1.41 Windows XP professional with all updates inc sp2 The computer runs and boots fine. </s>
<s> However, if left unattended, it will sometimes freeze. </s>
<s> Sometimes it will freeze when you use it but not as often as when left unattended. </s>
<s> Also, when I load the CoreCenter and DigiCell programs from msi, the computer freezes upon booting when the program auto starts up everytime. </s>
<s> So I removed those and the computer just locks up like usual, unattended. </s>
<s> Also, sometimes the computer will run lockup free for like a week. </s>
<s> Then one day, like over night, I will leave it on and i wake up the next morning and its frozen. </s>
<s> Also, sometimes if it is frozen, the computer will still be running, like the clock, but the mouse and keyboard don't respond. </s>
<s> If I hold in the power button to shut it off, the computer will go into the shutdown process, then freeze there once it says windows is shutting down. </s>
<s> This computer is like I said brand new. </s>
<s> Only a couple weeks old. </s>
<s> I built the computer, and no I am not a person who thought they could put together a person without knowing much about computers. </s>
<s> I have built several. </s>
<s> I e-mailed msi and they told me to try swapping out the memory. </s>
<s> So I just did that like 5 minutes ago and I will see what the results are </s>
<s> Do you have a 450 of larger power supply? </s>
<s> Is it on an uninterruptable power supply (UPS)? </s>
<s> If it is not on an UPS, then a minor AC dip can cause an issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a Fortron 400w power supply. </s>
<s> No, the computer is not hooked to a backup ups. </s>
<s> A ups shouldnt make a difference. </s>
<s> Without an UPS, a few cycles could go missing and the machine will lock up. </s>
<s> Your selection of the power supply is &quot;light&quot;. </s>
<s> Sadly, the tone of your post is &quot;it can't be that&quot;. </s>
<s> What has to happen is you need to collect more responses and decide what you wish to do about this. </s>
<s> Denial is not going to help you here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Would a bad AC line make sense if my previous computer worked fine on as well as the rest of the components on it ? </s>
<s> How is the power supply choice &quot;light&quot;. </s>
<s> Many reviews scored the power supply high reliability and overall output, especially in the voltage ranges used for an AMD processor. </s>
<s> The power supply helps ride out a few missing AC cycles. </s>
<s> And we always fit the UPS when people complain of overnight lockups. </s>
<s> It's a too-high percentage of cures so I write with certainty on that issue. </s>
<s> Hope you find it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It just produces a bad image. </s>
<s> Thats like saying, in order for your computer to run stable, you must hook up a ups. </s>
<s> I guess I am a little confused on how that could be the problem. </s>
<s> It's just one of the issues that is notable. </s>
<s> Having a just big enough supply as well as one that is over a year old doesn't let it ride out any AC power interuptions. </s>
<s> How about this. </s>
<s> Have you contacted the place that sold you these parts? </s>
<s> What do they suggest to do next? </s>
<s> All the usual other items are.. 1. </s>
<s> Latest BIOS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> BIOS defaults. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Only the RAM they suggest. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Case cover off. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> RMA it part by part until you find the bad part. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Recycled parts are suspect. </s>
<s> Remove them too. </s>
