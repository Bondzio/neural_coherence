I am going to Europe for 10 days and trying to decide between a netbook or a tablet so that I may check email in my hotel. I will have free wi-fi in the hotel, and checking email and some light web browsing are the only functions needed. I am looking to spend $200-$250, no more. Any suggestions? Thanks for the feedback.

I haven't taken mine on a trip yet, but I intend to this winter! It sends and receives email just fine. It holds it's charge for a long time, too. The only thing that I'll miss is the ability to transfer the photos that I take onto the tablet. My existing Netbook is sometimes a hassle to transport, but I love the ability to transfer my photos, evaluate them, and do a little basic editing before I get home, but this trip I know that I'll feel less burdened down with stuff. If we had the budget we could buy a tablet that could do all these things and more, but I'd prefer to spend the $$ on travel.
