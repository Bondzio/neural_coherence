Finally I found out that if I press in the adjacent button to the TURN ON button on the panel - then both - the screen would come on. I kept doing that for about 15 very long minutes. It would first stay on - then it just would turn off. Then I started getting weird PC problems. It would go into sleep mode, couldn't turn it on, then couldn't turn it off. Then it started REALLY slowing down. I said that's it, I probably have either a faulty video card/controller or I've got some kind of virus. I cleaned the machine 2x with AV's - one avast the other with F-Secure. Both times clean. Same with Malwarebytes. Then I took out all the plugs and just started cleaning the whole inside - thinking maybe there's a faulty connection or a dirty socket or something. Turned it on - same thing. Went into MSCONFIG and had a look around - took off some services not belonging to MS or anything important. Then cleaned out the systems file with Disk Clean. Then cleaned out the registry with a few programs. The PC is now on with the monitor - but because this is so out of the norm I want to know how I can pinpoint the problem if it's connected to the video card/controller etc. I ran a diagnostics with Everest but couldn't make much of what I read there. Any help - sure would be very much appreciated indeed. melamedet
