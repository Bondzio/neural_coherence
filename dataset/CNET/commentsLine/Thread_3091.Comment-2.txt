the promise add in cards had several possible uses.
they could increase the number of ide devices one could put in older pcs whose motherboards only allowed for 4. as well, some older motherboards couldn't take advantage of the size or speed of newer drives.
by now, this is all past.
if your motherboard specs say they support ata-133 which your drive can handle, you can yank the promise card.
there isn't much use for these anymore.
