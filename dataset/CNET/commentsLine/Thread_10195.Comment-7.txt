but he's waiting for the lowest price with free shipping to appear.
i doubt he'll get one.
but, no, i wouldn't call it a business class printer but it's price is quite reasonable and comes with several options that can double it such as network port, duplex printing and extra trays.
these printers will tend to be low end on basic memory might make heavy graphics an issue but certainly not text.
you can check the hp site for those more oriented to business use and they tend to run in the $1000-2000 range with monthly output capabilities of 200000 copies.
that's a lot of dead trees.
i agree with you about some of the modern printer designs.
they want to look like sports cars and not tractors.
that doesn't impress me at all.
