<s> I work in a school with the internet connection distributed to every room through ethernet ports on which every computer must plug itself to. </s>
<s> What is the cheapest/best wireless adaptor I can get that will just require being plugged into the ethernet port? </s>
<s> I want to use my laptop anywhere within the range of my classroom. </s>
<s> You need to get permission from the network administrator to ''plug in'' a Wireless Access Point (WAP). </s>
<s> Once you have a WAP (with the security settings your network administrator recommends), any computer that is to make a wireless connection to the WAP will need a Wireless Network Adapter. </s>
<s> The Wireless Network Adapter needs to be compatible with the WAP's broadcast standard (wireless-g, wireless-b, wireless-a). </s>
<s> Cheapest WAPs are often Wireless Routers that can be configured to function as a WAP. </s>
<s> It can be difficult to find a WAP that is simply plug-n-play because the existing network setup might not match the default WAP settings. </s>
<s> I have used small wireless routers as WAPs for classrom and hotel use. </s>
<s> They are usually called travel routers or compact routers. </s>
<s> You plug it in, configure it once, and pop it into your notebook travel bag when you are finished. </s>
<s> I have had success with the following compact/travel models: Linksys WRT54GC Linksys WTR54G Netgear WGR101 I usually travel with Linksys WRT54GC because it has a lot of functions and extra ports if needed. </s>
<s> You could cause a lot of problems on your school networks that would upset any network admin. </s>
<s> Believe me, it's easy to track too. </s>
<s> But, if you got permission to do this, the setup is simple. </s>
<s> Purchase ACCESS POINT and hook it into the port in the wall. </s>
<s> Broadcast your signal and voila! </s>
<s> Most of the time, this will not work because the Access Point needs to be registered on the network that is running on. </s>
<s> Chances are you will be able to connect to the network, but internet might not be allowed. </s>
<s> (Depends on the schools network.) </s>
