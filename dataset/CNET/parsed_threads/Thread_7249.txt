<s> Hi, I'm running Vista on my new laptop, and trying to connect to my family's secured wireless network. </s>
<s> It won't connect unless I reboot the router while my laptop is up and running. </s>
<s> If the connection is interrupted for any reason, including turning off or hibernating the laptop, I can't get back on unless I unplug the router and plug it back in again. </s>
<s> Two other computers on the network, 1 XP and 1 Vista, have no trouble establishing connection at all. </s>
<s> Has anyone heard of this problem before, and if so, how do I fix it? </s>
<s> I note one reason in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> But first tell us if you set it up as noted in our forum sticky. </s>

<s> ...but there are a bunch of stickies. </s>
<s> For future reference, how about linking (hopefully you know how) to the one you're specifically referring to. </s>
<s> And this discussion has so little detail about the setup that I can't offer much more. </s>
<s> That is, do you feel that a member should post no details, get asked, then begin or should the member go ahead and share the details and skip the first round? </s>
<s> In closing, did you try turning off Vista's Broadcast Flag? </s>
<s> And if you want a direct link, I'm going to bow out. </s>
<s> That flag on vista is widely discussed and quite a pain. </s>
<s> In closing, why dig up an old thread when you have a new issue? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Geez, just admit you don't know how to hyperlink and let it go. </s>
<s> You dug up an old post and don't have any network issue to discuss? </s>
<s> If so, please tell the forum that so folk know what your discussion is about. </s>
<s> About me hyperlinking. </s>
<s> Unlike some forums some moderators tend to teach how to find things. </s>
<s> That can upset those that want tech support. </s>
<s> This is all volunteer so the sooner you learn to use the forum and do the basic searches the less you need support. </s>
