1.3.1	According to the Service Manual is the average expected life .	St
1.3.2	Some will last longer and some less .	St
1.3.3	If you ever need to replace it I would recommend buying a printer with the same printhead { IP4000 } it would be cheaper then buying the printhead alone , plus you get a new set of carts .	St
1.3.4	Ebay sells the IP4000 pretty cheaply just make sure the include the ink and everything .	St

1.4.2	Just got off the phone with Cannon and a replacement is being sent under warranty .	St
