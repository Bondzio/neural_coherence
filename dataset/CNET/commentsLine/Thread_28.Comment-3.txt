but that wasnt really a answer more i fact i think... but this is a picture i made to show what exactly i am talking about.
the t1862 motherboard is a vc37  intel 845gl chipset, performance uatx mainboard for intel pentium 4 processor.
400mhz fsb, embedded graphics, ddr266, on-board audio, lan option, ultra ata100, usb 2.0 now im asking if theres a way that i can fix this or i could just buy one of these motherboards on this website.
im asking which motherboard out of the ones on that site is the best one to pick from?
