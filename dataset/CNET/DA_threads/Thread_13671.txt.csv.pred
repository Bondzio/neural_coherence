1.1.1	I am going to be training high school seniors on computer networking and I'm still searching for the perfect book.	St
1.1.2	I'd prefer to have (but not necessary) a book that also covers wireless and security if possible.	St
1.1.3	I obviously want to keep it on a level thats not too advanced but not for dummies either.	St
1.1.4	It should speak to the types of networks, OSI Model, etc.	St
1.1.5	Does anyone have any experience with this or have suggestions of a book I may want to try?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks.	St

1.2.1	The 'Dummies' series is good enough for 'not' so beginner.	St
1.2.2	As for more detail information, actually you don't need a book, because there are a lot of information on the internet that you can print.	St
1.2.3	Maybe you can give your student an assignment to go to certain website, take a note of any information they interested or need to know (+ the website address) and bring them to class to discuss it.	St
1.2.4	This way, everyone can collect as many information as they need, including you.	St
1.2.5	Then may be you can write your own book, specifically design for your class later on.	St
