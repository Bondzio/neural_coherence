i have a hd7770 and every time i have a game session after a while the video crash, the image freeze, i have black screen for a couple of seconds, and the game minimizes (display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered.).
i tried all latest amd drivers and with all of them i have this problem, i tested the video card on another pc and works perfectly, i tried to replace the 7770 with an nvidia 280gtx and the nvidia with its drivers do not crash, i also tried different psu on my pc but the problem persists.
could this be incompatibility between the video card and the motherboard ?
i also noticed it crashes more often with some graphic engines, less with others.
os: win7 cpu: i5 2310 motherboard: msi z68a-g43 video card: amd hd7770 ram: 8gb corsair ddr3 (2x4) psu: cx500w
