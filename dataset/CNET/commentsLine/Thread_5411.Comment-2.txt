why?
because most bd content is protected from such transcribing.
so a dead end there.
2. since we can't do item 1, there is no reason for question 2 but hd content has no known issue here on those players.
3. none.
you listed common solutions but not one will take bd content unless there is no copy protection and this forum forbids discussions about circumventing drm and more.
don't start that conversation unless you want it locked.
i do have a question for you.
if the maker or seller won't talk to you about your concerns, why would you buy their products?
