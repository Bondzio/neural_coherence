Hi I am trying to output to my TV using my laptop.
The problem is that I only have VGA out on my laptop.
I wanted a cheap solution so I tried using a VGA to SVIDEO cable using this cable on ebay.
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=3759&item=5150804185&rd=1 I tried using the standard rca jack and also the svideo jack.
My laptop does not have many features in the &quot;display&quot; link in the control panel.
I use the fn + f4 to output to my monitor and have been trying to do it with the cable while it is attached to my TV.
However when I do it all that happens is the tv flashes in black and white for a bit and I can barely see the text for about 2 seconds, after that the tv goes blank and my laptop screen stays on.
I don't know what I am doing wrong any ideas?
I wanted a cheap solution I have tried doing it with the tv plugged in while booting up the pc as well as plugging it in after the computer has started no difference.
