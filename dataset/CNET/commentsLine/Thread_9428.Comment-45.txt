there are so many computers on the market that look great, smell great, and look good on paper.
check for what you want though.
if you're a hardcore gamer, build one yourself.
that way is super cheap and not overpriced like buying a prefabbed one like hp, dell, sony, and gateway.
most of the computer distributers mark up the price by 200% or more and try to include &quot;free&quot; stuff when you buy.
besides the day you buy, it is considered old and almost priceless.
