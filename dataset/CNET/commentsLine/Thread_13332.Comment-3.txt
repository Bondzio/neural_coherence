i did actually find the problem.
it seemed that when i changed the settings that the wep key reset, so it wasn't the right one being used by my wireless network.
i found it out by accident as i was trying everything in my power to fix it, but hey, it worked.
have you tried that yet?
good luck on fixing your connection.
