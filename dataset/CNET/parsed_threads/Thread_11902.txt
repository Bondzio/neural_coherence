<s> Hi, I just formatted my HD and tried to install the VGA drivers downloaded from the Nvidia site. </s>
<s> the dowload goes ok but when running the setup it gives an error 'cant find drivers for your hardware'. </s>
<s> im certain i dowloaded the right drivers for my card. </s>
<s> i've done this 10 times or so and this has never happend. </s>
<s> any help apreciated. </s>
<s> the manufacturer of the card is Eagle. </s>
<s> system: pentium III 733MHz 256MB RAM Windows XP Eagle Nvidia GeForce2 MX400 </s>
<s> the motherboard drivers, It might need that to install the nvidia driver. </s>
<s> I have an old GF vid card. </s>
<s> As I played with nvidia drivers I got to a level where support for my card was dropped.....can't find drivers. </s>
<s> Benchmark wise...I find that I can't beat the old drivers from the maker. </s>
