I had a GBC shredder that worked okay for a year or so before dying, and these royals I see on ebay are not well reviewed. I want something that will handle all those credit card offers without having to open them. --and erase CD's too. any suggestions? thanks! - fj

I happen to visit OfficeMax and Office Depot today and gezzz, I didn't know they had so many &quot;shedders&quot; now. These aren't the little basic shedders neither that you can place atop a trash can, but come far better in motor and cutter ability. They offer to cut those plastic and Cds as well provided you pay enough for such a model. I just looked them over, I wasn't interested but thought to mention it. The local stores here has at least 7-8 different models to review. Check them out first hand rather than a catalog or such. But, I'm sure those with large amp motors(specs) tend to work better(IMHO). good luck -----Willy

Fry's a month or so ago had one on special, a &quot;Tech KO&quot; for $15 and I got it. Works fine and while I have never tried a CD, it does fine on a credit card. I am not sure it can take a whole CC offer unopened though as its rated 5 sheets at a time and the envelope plus 1 folded page whould be 5 thicknesses. I don't bother shredding the whole CC offer, just the one page you return to get the card which is usually the one page with my name/address on it. The rest goes in my paper recycle box. Rich
