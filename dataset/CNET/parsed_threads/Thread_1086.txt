<s> I'm planning on keeping this computer for years (5+). </s>
<s> Is this a good computer for gaming (would be be able to run today's games at acceptable speeds?). </s>
<s> And feed back would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Also, how are these i7 processors and am I getting good value for this price? </s>
