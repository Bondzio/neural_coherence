yeah, many modern mobos provide sata and ide connections.
at first, sata only offered marginal performance increase over ide.
but i hear sata tech is getting better and better so that'll be the way to go.
however, if you only have ide as of now... stick with it.
it really ain't worth upgrade just that fo sata.
instead, switch to it when you do a major upgrade.
many months ago, i had the choice to get a 120gb sata hd over a 160gb ide for the same price.
posters overwhelmingly suggested the latter citing the extra capacity would do me more good.
