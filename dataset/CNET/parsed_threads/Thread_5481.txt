<s> Hello, I got this specs from someone I know, and I want to know if these are good enough to run heavy games like Battlefield 4, Planetside 2 etc... </s>
<s> Please note that the budget is around 1120$. </s>
<s> Intel Core i5 4570 3.2Ghz (3.6Ghz Turbo) LGA1150 Tray Intel Original LGA1155-1150 Copper Core until 95W Gigabyte GA-B85M-D3H for 1150 2xCrucial 4GB DDR3 1600Mhz 1.5V CL11 Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 1TB SATA3 Sapphire 7950 3GB GDDR5 HDMI RETAIL DP with Boost DVDRW LITE-ON x24. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You have a leading edge list that is going to be in the top 1 percent of all PCs on the planet so why is there any doubt? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is there some reason you chose cl 11 ram? </s>
<s> I see cl 9 ram in the same price area. </s>
<s> The perf difference may amount to squat but.....it's your bucks. </s>
<s> That gpu is a 200w unit. </s>
<s> Given any thought to the psu? </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick answer. </s>
<s> I have a Seasonic ECO 500W psu, is that enough? </s>
<s> At 200 Watts the +12V rail would need at least 200/12 Amperes. </s>
<s> But you know to have 50% reserve so 200/6 = 33 Amperes and this PSU http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151024 if that's it has a paltry 17 Ampere rail. </s>
<s> It might be fine to get the machine up but I fear it is not good enough for the gear selected. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> With that gpu and gaming.....round numbers gets me to a 600w quality single rail unit. </s>
<s> Bigger won't hurt. </s>
<s> Your going to be pulling some serious power over long periods of time. </s>
<s> You don't want that psu to get hot/over worked and go wonky. </s>
<s> Is the Seasonic ECO 600W psu will be enough? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Shop for a quality &quot;single&quot; rail psu. </s>
<s> I don't know what country your in but that Eco thing seems to be a 200/240v input. </s>
<s> I don't really know what you mean by &quot;single&quot; rail psu, can u explain it? </s>
<s> I'm buying a case that the shop says it comes with a Seasonic ECO 600W psu. </s>
<s> Is that good? </s>
<s> I'm not sure, but I have found this: http://www.ocfreaks.com/imgs/seasonic-eco-600/seasonic_eco_spec.jpg I think it says it has 46 amperes, but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> Can you check it out? </s>
<s> https://duckduckgo.com/?q=single+rail+psu Can you share a link to that product so we can check it out? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'd go with that one. </s>
<s> http://www.tms.co.il/product/12156 Some of it are in Hebrew so I'm not sure if you will understand it all... </s>
<s> You supplied the specs above. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> But at this point I fear for your PC. </s>
<s> It met the needs and then you ask this. </s>
<s> Sadly this means to me you may be in over your head. </s>
<s> Is there some buddy that works with you on this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The links I'm seeing show that psu to be a dual rail unit with 18 amps per rail. </s>
<s> Your link seems to show a single rail unit with 46 amps. </s>
<s> Perhaps ask the shop what it is your buying. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if this unit is made different for different countries. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
