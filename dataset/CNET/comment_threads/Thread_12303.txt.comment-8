Thanks for taking the time to find/type that link for me, Bob.
I entered the settings from that URL, and found that I am using the newest firmware and using WPA.
I changed it to WPA2 because it said something about stronger connection with it.
So..
I guess everything looks good now.
I hope so anyways.
Thanks again for your help.
