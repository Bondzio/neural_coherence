The netbooks are starting to look attractive to me as a replacement for an old laptop that has roughly the same speed processor and a much smaller hard drive than comes with the netbooks. How practical is it to use one of these with Skype (including video on both ends) while having perhaps a web browser and Outlook open at the same time? Howard

Programs as in a web browser without playing a video at the same time? Sure. And if I was unclear. FORGET SKYPE VIDEO! Just the phone feature for now. When the dual core Atoms arrive my answer may change. Bob

Daughters IBM ThinkPad with XP Pro (fast machine, heavy on RAM) took forever to boot, forever to open a web page, slow all around, had to click Shut down twice to get it to power off. I worked on it for a couple of days then noticed Skype. Uninstalled it and BAM! Boots in less than two minutes and all the other speed problems are gone.

Skype does take a lot of resources, but it is a service that is great for my needs and is an &quot;always on&quot; program for me. I use it to communicate with family, friends, and business contacts on three continents every day. Thus my questions about its use on netbooks. Okay, enough of my free advertising for Skype ...
