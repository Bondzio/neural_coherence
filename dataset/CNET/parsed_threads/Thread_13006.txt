<s> Hi, I am trying to access two servers remotely from a computer off my local network. </s>
<s> Both servers get their Ethernet connection by both connecting to a switch and then connecting to my Belkin router. </s>
<s> One of the servers is a microprocessor with Ethernet connectivity and the other is a video server. </s>
<s> As an initial test, Ive successfully been able to connect to both the video and microprocessor server at the same time while connected to the same network. </s>
<s> Ive learned some about port forwarding and I configured my router to forward port80 using the microprocessors private IP address. </s>
<s> As a result, I was able to access the microprocessor server remotely. </s>
<s> The processor has stored a webpage that has a frame that retrieves the video feed from the video server. </s>
<s> So I tried configuring my router to forward another port (I selected and arbitrary port other than port 80) to the video servers private IP address. </s>
<s> Question 1: Am I allowed to arbitrarily assign another port (other than port80) for the video server or are theyre only certain ones I can use? </s>
<s> I tried this http:// &lt;routers public IP&gt;:&lt;port number&gt; to access servers video feed, but it didnt work. </s>
<s> Question 2: After assigning a port to forward for the video server, what would be its URL so that I can access it remotely too? </s>
<s> This will be used for the URL written in the HTML code on the framed page that accesses the video server. </s>
<s> Thanks so much in advance for your help! </s>
<s> Windell </s>
<s> But for 1 and 2. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Allowed, but newbies seem to hand troublem with port mapping and more. </s>
<s> I will not duplicate ready web content on port mapping and port forwarding. </s>
<s> Besides you didn't supply the model number so you made a choice to hamper others help. </s>
<s> I can't check if your router was a good choice for this. </s>
<s> Sorry if this sounds crass, but you must make a good post if you want a &quot;do this on this router's page.&quot; Your post was clear enough but neglected a key item. </s>
<s> Who and what I do. </s>
<s> I also design and program embedded devices. </s>
<s> Some are on ethernet and are remotely accessed via the internet so I've done this mapping. </s>
<s> What devices? </s>
<s> Cameras, access control, doors, temp, counts, etc. </s>

<s> Dear. </s>
<s> Mr. Proffitt, My questions were meant to be independent of a specific router because most routers these days already have the option to enable port forwarding. </s>
<s> Also, my application shouldn;t really be of your concern because again it is independent of my questions. </s>
<s> I understand that my post might've been unclear, but if you're sorry to be &quot;crass&quot; then why do you do it. </s>
<s> If you would like for clarification, I would've appreciated it if you asked instead of accusing me that my post was a choice on mypart to hamper others help. </s>
<s> I see you don't want to head to to the solution and let others supply you a do this for a specific router but by doing so you could learn what you need to know about solving your issue. </s>
<s> Make better posts, get better answers is what I've heard. </s>
<s> I did rewrite my first reply a few times and couldn't find a good way to tell you that leaving out details hampers everyone including you. </s>
<s> I also can't be your &quot;tech support&quot; so I've taken to not duplicating ready web content about port forwarding and other topics. </s>
<s> There are only so many hours in a day and only so many members that will reply. </s>
<s> Even less when the post is not complete. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
