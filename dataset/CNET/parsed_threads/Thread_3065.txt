<s> I'm trying to 'fix' an old clunker for a friend and although I have improved it somewhat, it is still the slowest piece of junk I've ever seen. </s>
<s> I've done several things to improve performance but might be out of luck with anything further. </s>
<s> The computer was like this when I started: 5-6 yr. old system by Daewoo: AMD Duron 1.3 with Windows XP Home installed. </s>
<s> (no service packs) 40gig HD, 5400rpm, jumpered as Cable Select, ATA100, NTFS format, no partitions. </s>
<s> 96 mb ram (according to Belarc) - supposed to be 128mb. </s>
<s> Onboard audio, video, lan. </s>
<s> Three pounds of dust and junk inside the case. </s>
<s> The computer had 'failed' and the owner took it to one of the locals who replaced the motherboard with a Via Technologies, Inc., KM266APro-835. </s>
<s> He got the system back, but could not get online again (DSL), so asked if I could re-install XP for him. </s>
<s> Since he forgot to bring the XP disk with him and was going to be out of town for a week, I took a look at this slow-moving, overloaded clunker. </s>
<s> It is painfully slow to load the system and once loaded, each task is extremely slow. </s>
<s> Opening a folder sometimes shows that flashlight icon, searching. </s>
<s> Once screens are opened, closing them results in them closing top to bottom, not all at once. </s>
<s> Double clicks are slow to respond. </s>
<s> Overall, I think the system is really underpowered and not adequately equipped to handle XP. </s>
<s> A slow hard drive and a barely minimal amount of memory are the prime culprits here. </s>
<s> But, I tried to speed it up anyway. </s>
<s> As far as I remember, this is what I've done so far: Cleared system of all junk files, tmp, bak, etc. </s>
<s> Partitioned disk to C and D. C holding the OS and Programs only. </s>
<s> D for data only. </s>
<s> Ran error-checking and defrag on both partitions. </s>
<s> DMA checked. </s>
<s> (thanks, Bob) Reads UDMA 5. </s>
<s> Upgraded Windows to SP2. </s>
<s> Installed an Ethernet card and got online, using my service. </s>
<s> Downloaded new versions of AVG, Ad-Aware and Spybot S&E and ran them all. </s>
<s> Found about 15 malwares. </s>
<s> Ran online scan with Trend-Micro. </s>
<s> Found one low-level malware. </s>
<s> Installed Powertools and increased speed of menu opening, etc. </s>
<s> Minor tweaks. </s>
<s> Ran memtest for quite awhile - no errors. </s>
<s> Checked bios settings. </s>
<s> Look okay, not being familiar with this board. </s>
<s> Nothing 'jumped out' at me. </s>
<s> And, it's still running slowly! </s>
<s> I may have forgotten other things I've tried, but I've got two more days to play with this so I'm open to any suggestions. </s>
<s> is inadequate RAM. </s>
<s> 96 Meg just won't cut it. </s>
<s> If it's supposed to be 128 one of the sticks is not seen by the system. </s>
<s> But even that is too low for XP. </s>
<s> ...when my friend had the board replaced. </s>
<s> There is only a single stick in the board at present. </s>
<s> My only drawback here is that I never saw how the system performed before all of this. </s>
<s> The machine has 128MB of ram. </s>
<s> The on-board vid uses 48MB. </s>
<s> 128 minus 48 equals 96. </s>
<s> Won't work very well for XP. </s>
<s> Even if you stripped out every possible unneeded task/process..it'll be slow. </s>
<s> Did you load the mobo drivers? </s>
<s> ...the MB drivers. </s>
<s> I didn't get any disks for this. </s>
<s> I'm not used to messing with either AMD processors nor NTFS, so I'm winging it. </s>
<s> Where would I be able to download MB drivers for this thing? </s>
<s> I'd revisit that setting in the BIOS about how much RAM to give the video display. </s>
<s> I've cut such settings to the lowest number possible since this machine is NOT A GAMING RIG so even 4 MEG is plenty for the video display. </s>
<s> This box needs every scrap of RAM it can find so this could be a free boost. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Checked the bios and can't see anywhere to allot video. </s>
<s> Not many choices in this Phoenix bios. </s>
<s> Can't see anything in Control Panel/Display either. </s>
<s> And a further smack in the face, Windows advises me I have to register again. </s>
<s> Probably because of the additional ethernet card. </s>
<s> Love this! </s>
<s> I too suggest lots of ram. </s>
<s> Add a 256 or better yet two of them. </s>
<s> When it's up and running hit the ol Ctrl+Alt+Del and check task manager under Performance tab / PF Usage. </s>
<s> See how much it uses, if it's over 96MB then your using the hard disc as ram. </s>
<s> You can trim it down by running msconfig and disabling stuff from the startup tab but I doubt you'll trim it down to stay under 96mb. </s>
<s> Heck i'm using 282mb with just firefox, yahoo messenger, avg, and a couple other small programs runnin but then again i have 1gb of ram. </s>
<s> I don't see the point in partitioning the hard drive? </s>
<s> If you trimmed the C which contains the OS down too small it doesn't leave much room for the PF Usage thus really making the system crawl or possibly lockup! </s>
<s> My experience is XP and NTFS like big hard drives. </s>
<s> You won't get fraggmented quite so much unlike with smaller ones. </s>
<s> Also I have yet to use a AMD Duron but i'd suggest a processor upgrade to an athlon. </s>
<s> You can probably find a 950~1.2ghz for cheap on ebay or if i'm guessing the motherboard right possibly up to a athlon XP with 266fsb maybe even 333mhz? </s>
<s> The L2 on a Duron is a mere 64k vs a Athlon 256k and a Athlon with Barton core @ 512k. </s>
<s> Also does the motherboard take DDR RAM? </s>
<s> If so Circuit City has a MIR deal on a 512mb stick. </s>
<s> All else fails at least add ram and possibly reinstall windows. </s>
<s> But remember if it's not a OEM or retail disk then your probably askin for trouble. </s>
<s> Also you may have to call M$ seeing how they changed the mobo. </s>
<s> I had a 1.3ghz athlon with 512mb/ddr 20 gig hard drive that was quite fast with xp, not much of a multitasker or workhorse but surfed the net and other general use quite fine. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I'm a Linux person so I'd recommend replacing a high-resource hog like Windows altogether. </s>
<s> Linux will run on the smell of an oily rag and will usually outperform Windows on the same machine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Your machine has computer asthma. </s>
<s> For either staying with Windows OR trying Linux, go and buy a 256Meg stick of memory. </s>
<s> If that helps and you and you think it's worth it, buy another stick and put that in as well. </s>
<s> PS, At the risk of starting a &quot;try this&quot; thread, I'd recommend using Ubuntu as the Linux system. </s>
<s> www.ubuntu.com If you're not sure about Linux, you can run it as a 'Live CD' which means you can keep your Windows system but boot off the CD and see what Linux looks like. </s>
<s> Ubuntu isn't the only Linux Live CD option out there but it is one of the easiest for a windows user to quickly assess. </s>
<s> I have a network of nine computers at home, 5 of them use windows, the others use Linux. </s>
<s> One of my greatest pleasures is getting old clunkers to run like new again by running them on Linux. </s>
<s> This system is woefully underpowered for XP, but it should be a bit faster than what you are describing. </s>
<s> The 48mg of missing memory is an attention getter, but it may be the video reserve making the difference. </s>
<s> If you have any extra compatible memory, even in a different system, use it to temporarily check out this possible issue by installing it in the same slot now occupied and seeing what is reported. </s>
<s> Then move it to the adjacent slot and check again. </s>
<s> Do the same with the old memory and compare. </s>
<s> This will tell you if you have a bad memory stick or a bad slot. </s>
<s> I believe that Belarc reports all system memory and where it is installed. </s>
<s> Also make sure that the hard drive is not on the same IDE ribbon as any optical drive. </s>
<s> The IDE channel will adjust itself to the slowest hardware on the ribbon, matching the hard drive to the (probably 33) speed of the optical drive. </s>
<s> When you are using the page file at the rate that this system does you can really bottleneck things this way. </s>
<s> This is something often overlooked, or not known, to someone doing upgrading or adding a second optical drive. </s>
<s> Many think that transfer is faster if both optical and hard drive are on the same ribbon, missing the synchronization issue. </s>
<s> This system obviously needs to be pared down to the bare essentials for running processes at any time. </s>
<s> Things like smartcard and ups are probably not needed. </s>
<s> Look over the processes for any fluff and set to manual or disable. </s>
<s> You can also apply a simple tweak to speed up the file search time. </s>
<s> From the start menu click &quot;run&quot;. </s>
<s> Type &quot;cmd&quot; and hit enter. </s>
<s> Type &quot;NET STOP STISVC&quot; to stop the process. </s>
<s> Then type &quot;SC CONFIG STISVC START= DISABLED&quot; to disable it at startup. </s>
<s> (Type them exactly as shown here without the &quot;.) </s>
<s> Reboot and check for any improvement. </s>
<s> To not run SP2. </s>
<s> I had much more luck and speed with SP1. </s>
<s> Also, do not update and with the unit I use only MS office, and 3 additional programs. </s>
<s> I clear all temp files weekly . </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> I thought 128 minus 48 equaled 80 My old 5 year old computer had 32 on-board vid 128 minus 32 equals 96 Doesn't matter reguardless </s>
<s> Works great, unless you absolutely need Windows. </s>
<s> I'm running linux on a pentium pro 200 with 96 MB of ram. </s>
<s> In fact, there are multiple linux versions that run from the cdrom drive or load entirely into memory. </s>
<s> On 96 megabytes of system memory, you can run Puppy Linux, DSL (Damn Small Linux), or virtually any other &quot;featherweight&quot; distributions. </s>
<s> Xubuntu and Zenwalk use a little too much memory to work, unfortunately, but if you can bring it up to at least 192 megabytes of RAM you'll be able to run either of these systems. </s>
<s> They will give your friend a much MUCH better experience than the featherweight distributions. </s>
<s> Note: If you decide to do the latter and use Zenwalk, make sure you download the full version, not the core; and if you decide to use Xubuntu you should download the Alternate install disc (not the Desktop CD). </s>
<s> I'm stumped. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the suggestions but this thing still chugs along. </s>
<s> Even trying to open a folder is a chore. </s>
<s> The only other thing I could try is a complete re-install but don't have any of his disks right now. </s>
<s> We'll see if he wants to try that. </s>
<s> I just want rid of it! </s>
<s> Hello, like others have said, you need more ram, fact. </s>
<s> I just have to say why not try linux? </s>
<s> You can use one of the many live versions out there to see how it runs or if it will. </s>
<s> Have a old and mean old gateway 433c with only a 10 G HD but am running 256 mem. </s>
<s> Tried linux XP on it finaly installed fedora core 4 on it. </s>
<s> Linux Knoppix 3.7 live cd is the one that runs good on it. </s>
<s> Am a Win. </s>
<s> person but Linux sure has turned my head. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Judging by the amount of dirt I found inside the case, the owner might be more adept at potato farming. </s>
<s> The first thing I would have performed on this machine would have been way more RAM. </s>
<s> Windows XP doesn't even begin to work faster until you are over 512mb. </s>
<s> Especially if your using onboard Video. </s>
<s> I would recommend 1gb for systems with onboard Video. </s>
<s> You were severely limited with the earlier versions of Windows 95 and 98, Millenium,etc. </s>
<s> They would become unstable over 512mb. </s>
<s> There was a trick you could do to run 1gb of memory with those OS's but it was a little complicated. </s>
<s> Anyway I got off the point. </s>
<s> More RAM is what you NEED to start with then go with tweaks. </s>
<s> Last but not least do you ever want to just start deleting and shutting things down. </s>
<s> Also SP2 will NOT slow things down but only help your OS by fixing the many bugs the original OS had so I can not see running anything but the latest version of the XP OS. </s>
<s> More RAM is the secret engine to this crisis. </s>
<s> Also, now that you have messed with alot of the settings and processes I would also reinstall with a clean OS again with MORE RAM. </s>
<s> I find it hard to believe that your BIOS on that MB doesn't have any settings for allotted ram to your onboard Video too. </s>
<s> Most tech's suggest only setting that to 4mb as this is plenty to use on anything other than for gaming or photography. </s>
<s> Please LOOK again at your BIOS and I am sure it is there. </s>
<s> And lastly go to the MB Manufacturers website and download the latest 4 in 1 VIA drivers and install them right after you get through reinstalling Windows. </s>
<s> Also check for the drivers for onboard video, sound, lan,and USB (but be careful with USB because alot of these are for Windows Millenium, 98, 2000, only). </s>
<s> Just read it carefully because it may tell you you do not need the USB download with XP and newer. </s>
<s> Ok, I wish you luck and again MORE RAM. </s>
<s> Why not buy another 128MB of RAM and see what that does? </s>
<s> Or even better a 256MB card. </s>
<s> I've got a rig with a 1.1 gig Duron, 768 megs of PC133 RAM, running XP Pro SP2 and it works just fine for just about everything. </s>
<s> I wouldn't use it for gaming but it's good for what I use it for, music, DVD's, etc. </s>
<s> ...but this is NOT my machine. </s>
<s> If it were, I wouldn't spend a dime on it in an attempt to run XP. </s>
<s> The owner will have to decide what to do. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the suggestions, folks. </s>
<s> I tried a few adjustments in the bios yesterday and made a change in the XP properties/performance tabs and this bumped up the installed ram reading to112mb, according to Belarc. </s>
<s> Still underpowered, but running better. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the suggestions. </s>
