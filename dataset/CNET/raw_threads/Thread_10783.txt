Hey guys, I just bought a new 250GB hard drive for my computer and I installed it as my slave drive, I already have a 40GB hard drive installed as my master. I installed my new game (resident evil 4) onto the new hard drive (F drive) everything worked fine. I played the game for a couple minutes but then I decided to update it because apparently the game is 100x's better if you update. My issue is... When I go to update the game, I save the download onto my old drive (C Drive) and when I click run, the program does not read that my game is located on my F drive and it says that the game is not installed, it's only reading whats on my C drive. How do I make it work? PLEASE Thanks, Travis PS: I'm running Windows XP if that helps?

I'm sure you have rebooted and tried installing the update again. Windows Should be able to know that you have another drive?
