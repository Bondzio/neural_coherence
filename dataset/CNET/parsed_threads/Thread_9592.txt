<s> Hello, I have seen previous posting on this problem but no answers, so I'm wondering if anyone has some new advice. </s>
<s> I have installed a Pentium III 667 MHz processor (from an IBM 300PL-6584) into an IBM Aptiva 545 (2171-545) and get the error message &quot;CPU BIOS Update Code Mismatch) after booting. </s>
<s> I tried getting a BIOS update floppy, but the computer will not even access the floppy before it gives this message nor will it allow me to enter the BIOS menu. </s>
<s> The IBM 300PL accepted the Pentium III 450MHz processor (from the Aptiva 545) once the BIOS update had been completed. </s>
<s> I contacted IBM and they told me that there shouldn't be any compatibility issues, so I am stuck as what to do. </s>
<s> I've found forums on the net about that message, but only dealing with Acer PCs. </s>
<s> I've gotten the newest BIOS update (6/30/2000) for the Aptiva and still no results. </s>
<s> I also have put the old processor back and re-updated the BIOS, which has not helped yet. </s>
<s> If anyone has any ideas as how to fix this issue, PLEASE let me know. </s>
