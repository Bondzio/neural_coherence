1.1.1	This is probably an easy question to answer , but I 'm a n00b so here goes : I just bought a video card , cost me like 300 dollars and I was wondering if I would need an extra power source to run it .	St
1.1.2	To find this out I need to determine what kind of power source I already have in this cheap wal-mart computer , so can anyone help me ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or is there anything else I need to know , maybe I 'm going about this wrong ... any help would be greatly appreciated !	St
1.2.1	Check where the main input cable goes , and there should be a big fan beside it .	St
1.2.2	Take off the Computer side cover and there should be a box 9 x 6 x 4 & quot ; .	St
1.2.3	On the side there should be a description , like 'ATX 12 volt ' 'with 'PFC ' etc .	St
1.2.4	Then there should be a data sheet in small writing with wattage , etc .	St
1.2.5	beneath the description .	St
1.2.6	Depending on what card you bought , think about a minimum of 400 watts .	St
