i have a mitsubishi wd-52627 and i intend to use it as my computer monitor, it has an hdmi input for a computer as well.
my pc is a dell dimension 4700 with an intel pentium 4 cpu 3 ghz and has 512 mb of ram.
the card i have now is supports s-video but i do not care for the picture quality whenever i plug the pc into my mitsubishi.
my question is what kind of card should i buy to support hdmi?
or can this be supported?
and finally is this an easy install?
(easy is a relative term, i know)
