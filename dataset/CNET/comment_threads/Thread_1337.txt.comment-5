I buy the remanufactured ones because even it it messes up my printer at the long run, with the price i pay for original inks I could get another printer with new ink.
But I been using this remanufactured inks for years with the reset chips and I tell you it works perfectly for my letterheads, flyers, business cards, heat transfers, thesis, homeworks etc...., even the toners i get like that too, and i am happy my wife is happy, I get to eat my rice and beans and steaks more often, other than allowing them at epson, hp, or lexmark eat it for me....God Bless, One Soul for Christ Ministry uses all this ink from Amazon, cheap, good, delivery on time, and more reliable from houseofinks, inktoners, inks123, etc......go ahead try it, you will like it, cause it is good production......
