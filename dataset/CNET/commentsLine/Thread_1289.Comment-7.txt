speakers, because the unit does not have an amplifier built in.. the first link that i went to [$190 or so] said that it came with powered speakers, then saw on other links that you could get it much cheaper without speakers.
didn't know that you bought it through ebay.
i've never even looked there for anything.
i figure if i got burned once i would never save enough to make up for it on another purchase.
you can get a cheap pair of powered speakers at wal-mart for $15.00.
with a so called &quot;woofer&quot; for $25.00.
hope that things turn out ok, now that you know the solution.
