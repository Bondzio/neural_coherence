<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> I'm having some trouble with my wireless network: I use a Planet WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter to connect to a WAP-1963 Wireless Acess Point (which is about 3.5 Km away) which in turn is connected to a computer hooked up to the internet. </s>
<s> For a long time this setting has worked out for me and I have been acessing the internet without any problem whatsoever. </s>
<s> But for no apparent reason, my computer detects that there is a network (WEP enabled and with network authentication - no news for me here) avaliable but it just doesn't connect to it. </s>
<s> Only SOMETIMES. </s>
<s> By that, I mean that out of the blue I suddenly get connected to the network and some time later (which varies from minutes to hours) I get disconnected for no reason whatsoever. </s>
<s> And not to mention that the connection is extremely slow! </s>
<s> I've tried changing the PCI card in to different slots, tried fidling with the cable that connects to the antenna, tried fiddling with the antenna itself. </s>
<s> The same problem persists on a Windows system as it does on a Linux Ubuntu system. </s>
<s> I just want to stress that it was working fine just the way it was, and for some reason it has been giving me problemas. </s>
<s> The hosting computer (with the AP) hasn't even been touched in the past few months, so I believe the problem lies somewhere between the AP and my computer. </s>
<s> Here's some info of my pc: Windows Xp / Linux Ubuntu Dapper Drake AMD Athlon 1.24Ghz, 512 Mb RAM WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter, WEB enabled, Shared authentication, Power save: none, Fragment threshold: 2432, RTS threshold: 2346, Wireless mode: 802.11b, Preamble mode: long, Channel plan: FCC, Data rate: auto, channel 11, frequency 2462MHz, network type: infrastructure. </s>
<s> Any suggestions will be greatly apreciated! </s>
<s> But what has changed over time is more people have more radio devices. </s>
<s> You may have to change or improve your equipment. </s>
<s> Yes it worked in the past. </s>
<s> Now you get to adjust for today's RF environment. </s>
<s> I fear the fix will not be cheap given the 3.5 Km link. </s>
<s> But since it was done before, let the person who built it come up with a new solution. </s>
<s> I also hear you when you say it works sometimes. </s>
<s> An interferring signal can be on &quot;sometimes.&quot; To find that will be costly. </s>
<s> I know the last time I was on such a hunt it was with 20 other engineers and vans full of gear for Motorola. </s>
<s> When someone wants to find the interferring source, they better be ready to pay. </s>
<s> In closing the cheap fix could be to replace each part with known good parts. </s>
<s> You may exclaim that's costly but troubleshooting and finding the interference is assuredly more costly by at least 10 to 100 times. </s>
