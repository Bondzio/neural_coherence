10860	0	148288	1655048	NR	Dolphindave	1/7/06 5:12 PM	1.13665392E12	Transform and Lighting	Being reluctant to spend money and of the old fasion opinon that pc's should be as long lasting as appliences from the 70's (yeah I know) I am still using a ATI/Rage Fury Pro Xpert 2000 PRO card. Does this card support ''Transform and Lighting''? Probably not and if it doesn't can any recomend an inexpensive card that does. I have a gigabyte Socket A mother board GA-7VAXP with an AMD Athalon XP 1800 chip. Also can any one help me with navagating ATI's site. Can I E-mail them this question? Where on the site? Customer support only seems to have a telephone option. Thanks, everyone David

I've also used their telephone for a few bucks and the tech then set up an email back and forth operation at no extra cost, and didn't have own any ATI products.

Re transform and lighting for a new card, simply call their sales department. You can usually con one of them to find the answer for you. I have always found them to go out of their way to help. Of course, one cannot start by yelling at them and telling them their stuff is junk as I suspect some others have done, then they complain here about the lack of support. Not implying that about you in any way.
