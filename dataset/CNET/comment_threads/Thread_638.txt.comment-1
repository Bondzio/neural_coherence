I have dlink dsl modem Belkin Pre N router 1 wired desktop and three wireless laptops all working just fine.
I have 1 wireless desktop when it boots up is ok after 1 min it can not get internet access with IE or IM.
If i ping google it comes back ok, any help would be fantastic.
All PC win xp pro.
Belkin router has dhcp turned on.
