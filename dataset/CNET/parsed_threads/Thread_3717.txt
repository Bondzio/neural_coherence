<s> I have a data disk that I recently burned on my DVD burner. </s>
<s> The disk was nearly full. </s>
<s> Now, when I try to access a couple of the files on the disk (towards the end of the list) on either one of my DVD drives on my system (I have both a burner and a straight DVD drive), I can't access them. </s>
<s> It just stuggles with them and does't play (the files are movies). </s>
<s> But I tried playing them on a system at Staples, and they played fine with no problem. </s>
<s> I have noticed some problems before accessing files on full DVD's. </s>
<s> My system consists of a Pentium 4 running at 2.53 Ghz., 256 meg memory, 2 160 GB HD's, 1 DVD +R burner and one DVD drive, all running under Windows ME. </s>
<s> I know Windows ME has a 4 GB file size limit, thought maybe that limitation was causing the problem. </s>
<s> Any input would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> If the disc is readable on the DVD recorder then you are proving that the failing DVD drive is just getting old. </s>
<s> Some will go into denial over that, but we just wait and let the drive fail more and more until the owner caves in and tries a new drive. </s>
<s> For now, try a CD/DVD lens cleaner. </s>

<s> I had considered the possibility of a drive going out, but two drives at once? </s>
<s> Along with that the fact that the same drive that I burned the DVD with won't play all of it? </s>
<s> I suppose it's possible, but the fact that neither drive will play all the files has me scratching my head. </s>
<s> I used a lens cleaner on the drives today, regrettably didnt help any. </s>
<s> One bad one can interfere with the other. </s>
<s> It's why you test each on their own. </s>
<s> And try a new IDE cable (common failure point.) </s>
<s> Be sure to try a known working drive so you don't waste your days with bad drives. </s>
