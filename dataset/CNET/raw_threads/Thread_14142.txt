Does anyone know what motherboard Dell ships in an XPS 410 if you select a Pentium D processor? I know the 410 is made for Core 2 Duo and that the 400 was the one with Pentium D, but the 400 is gone now and I don't know the motherboard in either of them. Help?

Thos specs aren't etched in stone. If your thinking &quot;modification&quot;, be ye ever ready. Went thru it one time - got tricked - wasted some clams.
