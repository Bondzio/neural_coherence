1.1.1	I have to buy a desktop to use as a server for either windows 2000 or windows 2003.	St
1.1.2	I would go for a laptop but they are not really good as servers.	St
1.1.3	I am looking for compact size like HP slimline or Dell XPS 210.	St
1.1.4	But can we use them as Servers?	St
1.1.5	Anyone has any experience, please share.	St
1.1.6	Also any other suggestions are welcome.	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you	St
1.2.1	Goto either Dell or HP, etc.	St
1.2.2	and check out servers and review thier specs.	Sug
1.2.3	You'll see they're slightly different from basic systems.	St
1.2.4	If you really want a server to maintain uptime, don't skimp on the goods.	St
1.2.5	Even an older server system will suffice for typical server needs if all you want is a server in general.	St
1.2.6	In other words, servers aren't build for speed/brute force as much as they are for reliability.	St
1.2.7	tada -----Willy	St
