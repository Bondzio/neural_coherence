the answer is not so simple.
the bios must support it as well.
some boards didn't boot until the bios was updated.
since you didn't share the make/model of the motherboard, you didn't give the forums a chance to find out if said p4 was supported.
so far, we read just p4 w/800mhz fsb and &quot;prescott&quot;.
there is a lot of parallels between the auto-parts stories and this one.
there's a long story about buying a replacement lamp for the headlights.
it's amazing the details that are needed to know what fits what.
same story here.
tell more.
