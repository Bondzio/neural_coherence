Sony Vaio is a really bad laptop!
I used mine for a whole 8 months before it needed a new hard-drive.
Sony doesn't do any data rescue or anything, so I had to fight through on my own.
Customer Service all but yelled at me when I called, too.
It's now a year and a half later and the cd/dvd drive doesn't work and I have just had to take it in for servicing at Best Buy, where Geek Squad managed to screw things up even more.
The laptop is now just a typewriter.
It's a terrible, terrible product -- a complete waste of money.
