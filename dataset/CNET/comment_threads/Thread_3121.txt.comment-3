I am using Windows 7 and i couldn't use the windows tool because i wanted to create 2 partitions, one with like 100GB in FAT32 so i could use it to backup my PS3 data while the rest of the hdd in NTFS.
Since there are limitations for FAT32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software.
