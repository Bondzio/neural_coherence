if this is &quot;good&quot; capitalism (to add junk to a product because vendors of junk will pay to have it included in other products -- at the expense of buyers) then we have a capitalism problem (which, indeed, we do!).
our jobs are shipped overseas to cut costs and raise profits.
our parts are purchased from the cheapest vendor, not the most reliable with the best product.
every capitalism decision is based on the almighty dollar?
deals are made with larger companies for mass outlet sales (i.e., wal-mart, circuit city, best buy, etc.)
who will gladly sell the junk with the discounted prices they can obtain, because it allows them to mass-market their product.
i do get it.
i have been getting it for a long time, but have not liked it at all.
and i believe it is time to call for a halt to the nefarious practices -- even if they lower pc prices for consumers.
build a good product, a clean, fast product, and sell it that way.
why build a fast product (x2 and dual core cpu's,and faster memory and hard drives with faster graphics cards), then slow them all down with loads of crapola that most people will never use???
makes no sense to me.
and, yes, it is a good suggestion to buy the small business and business models that come without the junk.
thank you very much!
now, manufacturers, do something about the home and home office models, that don't need the junk either.
american capitalism has always found a way to do what is right for the consumers.
why can't a way be found now?
i am asking for the option to install or not install.
i am not venting.....well, maybe a little.....or a lot!
because i am genuinely ticked off because of the inconsiderate capitalistic decisions made against the very people who buy the products.
