1.4.1	auggief hi try this , also anyone else who has the same problem with there startup and shutdown sounds in xp .	St
1.4.2	Click start , click run , type regedit and enter .	St
1.4.3	click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER to highlight it , then in the right plain where it says ( default ) REG_SZ value not set right click on ( default ) click delete and your problem hopefully will be sorted Its an easy fix usually happens after a bsod or a faulty download , if your not sure about changing things in your registry than i would recommend you back it up first before doing anything , but like i said before its an easy fix and if you follow what i have said you should be ok .
