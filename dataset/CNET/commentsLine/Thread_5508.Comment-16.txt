if anyone comes up with an answer to virginia's problem i would like to know what it is.
i have the same exact problem, but mine is with a 320mb seagate hd.
too bad her drive is a wd.
i was going to buy a wd to replace the seagate hd that went bad.
trying to obtain help from seagate is a waste of time.
i believe wd has bought them out and seagate has become a step child that wd does not want to be bothered with.
