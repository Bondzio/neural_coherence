1.1.1	I'm looking to get a printer for my home, I know to get an inkjet printer.	St
1.1.2	I just don't know if I should get a printer with seperate color cartridges or an all in one.	St
1.1.3	And if I get an all in one, when one color goes out do I have to replace the whole thing?	St
1.1.4	I just want to know which would be the most cost effective.	St
1.1.5	Since I noticed some of the cartridges cost almost as much as the unit itself!	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	Have you ever heard about the marketing of razors and blades?	St
1.2.2	Same thing happens in printers.	St
1.2.3	But I prefer the separate colors.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'm so very, very green.	St
1.3.2	I've had my lap top * days...there's just so much information out there.	St
1.3.3	It seems like the more I research The more confused I ge!	St
1.3.4	So If I get the seperate cartridges is there a way that I can refill them myself?	St
1.4.1	Ok, without the make, model of the printer I can't answer about color carts.	St
1.4.2	But in a nutshell just look at the offerings.	St
1.4.3	It will sink in quickly.	St
1.4.4	Refills?	St
1.4.5	Sorry, 2 decades of watching others try and I decided to never do that myself.	Sug
1.4.6	Instead I only print what I really really really (times infinity) need.	St
1.4.7	Big savings.	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thank-you..I'm off to Best Buy...Hopefully one day I might know more than where the keyboard is..	St
