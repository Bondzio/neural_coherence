i am confused about whether or not i need to set up an internet server or not if i am outside my home network and want ssh access to the internet.
the app ssh tunneling (android market) gives the user ssh internet access.
it seems too simple to just configure a windows sshd on my home pc via port forwarding and get all that safe internet power..... doesn't make sense to me, i guess.
