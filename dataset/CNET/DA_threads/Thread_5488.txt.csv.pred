1.1.1	Hello, I have an asus g73jh-bst7 and i recently repasted the gpu, and now the screen is fine until the mouse goes within about 5 pixels of the left border of the screen, while the cursor is close to the left edge a horizontal tear line appears across the screen at the same vertical position as the mouse, external monitors dont give the error, I've reconnected the monitor cable about 5 times now to no avail, anyone got any tips... p.s.

1.1.2	its not under warranty	St
1.2.1	You didn't reveal why you were inside the laptop but it's usually the cable to/from the LCD, the LCD or the motherboard.	St
1.2.2	The external working is a good clue but is not enough to tell us when part to replace.	St
1.2.3	When in doubt, replace the cheapest part first.	St
