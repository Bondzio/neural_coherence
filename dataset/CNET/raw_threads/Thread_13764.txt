The BIOS on the RAID controller is FastTrack TX2000. When I use a Windows XP setup CD to boot, it loads a bunch of drivers and invites me to install Windows XP. Then it says that it can't find a hard drive and invites me to reboot. What should I try?

I'd recheck the install instructions from Promise to see if you need to press a F6 or other key during install to slip in some diskette with drivers. You'll also run into this with non-Intel chipsets. Again an expert's only type install with drivers on diskettes at the right steps. Just FYI. There is no step by step instructions that match your hardware (unless you are very lucky.) I only find GUIDES. In closing, another issue is you have only &quot;XP&quot;. XP without the integrated SP1 or SP2 does have disk size limits that could also be at issue. Bob

Proffitt is correct: you have to install the driver early in the XP installation process. Before you copy the drivers to a floppy, don't forget to extract the files form the zipped archive after you download them. http://www.promise.com/support/download/download_eng.asp
