<s> The usual setup: cable modem -&gt; PC. </s>
<s> The owner gets that working and then connects up the router like so: cable modem -&gt; router -&gt; PCs. </s>
<s> It never works. </s>
<s> They move the cable from the router back to the PC and it works. </s>
<s> They think the router is defective. </s>
<s> -&gt; What's going on? </s>
