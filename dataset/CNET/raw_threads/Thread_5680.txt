Given no model number I can't check if a wifi print server would work but bluetooth is something of a non-starter for many reasons. The number one reason is either it doesn't connect to wifi and the other being the 5 or more minute page printing time. Bob

Bluetooth is a horse of another color and works only with other compatible hardware. The HP wireless device was bit pricey, as I recall, but it worked. Others cost less and might work as well.
