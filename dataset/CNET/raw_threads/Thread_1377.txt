I have an HP Pavilion zd8000, and all the specs I could find on the Internet indicate that it should have a Dual Layer DVD-RW drive, but no site indicates whether it's optional or standard for the computer (I assume optional). I seem to remember getting mine with a Dual Layer DVD-RW, but I just stuck in a DL disc and it couldn't read it. Is there any way to figure out whether it's a DL DVD-RW or just a normal DVD-RW? Thanks.

If you look on the side of the computer with drive (should be the left-hand side), there should be 3 icons on the drive door. The first one (towards the back of the computer) should be the DVD symbol, the middle one should be the CD symbol (says &quot;disc&quot;), and the one towards the front should say &quot;RW&quot;. Underneath the very front one, it will say &quot;DVD+R DL&quot; in very small letters if you have a double-layer drive. I believe it came standard on all zd8000's, but I'm not sure.
