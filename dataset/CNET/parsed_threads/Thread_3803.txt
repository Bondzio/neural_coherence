<s> hi..well i need a new computer that i can work with for about a year and half until i get a good laptop, because of this i dont want to go spend too much and get a high end pc, since i dont need a good gaming pc i use my ps3 for gaming. </s>
<s> well basically i wanna know the difference between the core 2 duo processor and a pentium D (dual core ) processor. </s>
<s> also these are the 2 computers i was looking at: http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0665000FS10088503&catid= or http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&sku_id=0665000FS10091910&catid= which one is better? </s>
<s> thanks, any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> The Core 2 Duo beats the pants off the old P4 D and I measured the watts on each box. </s>
<s> P4 D was 205 Watts. </s>
<s> C2D (2.13GHz) was 95 to 100 Watts. </s>
<s> The C2D even at the higher clock rate than yours beats my old machine so badly that I'm going to write no contest. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yea i guess the c2d is a better deal, they both cost the same but the c2d one comes with vista, and has an extra 1gb of ram. </s>
<s> is the NVIDIA GeForce 7350 LE a decent graphics card? </s>
<s> and it says that there is another available pci slot , that means i can upgrade the graphic card right?.. </s>
<s> i think its a pretty good deal for 500 bucks. </s>
<s> Tomshardware.com listed the 7300 as best video card under 100 bucks... Bob </s>
<s> http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&mco=9A515E80&node=home/desktop/mac_mini thats a link for a mac mini for like 600 bucks. </s>
<s> a mac mini is incredibly small and just as fast as a normal desktop. </s>
<s> the cheap one has only 80 gb hard drive though. </s>
<s> you could get an external hard drive for more room that you can use with the laptop you will get soon. </s>
<s> macs have alot better of an OS i prefer mac os to windows and i have only used macs in a store =P. </s>
<s> i prefer them because ive had so many problems with windows and osx wouldnt have failed me yet most likely. </s>
<s> you can also put windows on a mac if youd like. </s>
<s> anyway i recommend the mac mini and you can buy a 19 inch widescreen for like $250 or so. </s>
<s> i loved my 19 inch and still do as a secondary monitor. </s>
<s> i think ull be happy with the mac mini. </s>
