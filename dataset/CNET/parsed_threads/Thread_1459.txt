<s> Recently our security department has declared that we aren't allowed to use wireless networks in our office as part of a new protocol. </s>
<s> The problem is that we often have large group in our conference room which require internet access, but only two ports. </s>
<s> I've got the old Linksys Wireless N Router (Model No WRT300N V1) still. </s>
<s> Is there a way to use it only as a router and disable the wireless capabilities short of breaking of the antennae? </s>
<s> And a quick look in the manual shows you can disable the radio in the router's setup pages. </s>
<s> For MORE PORTS another switched hub (these are cheap) can be added. </s>
