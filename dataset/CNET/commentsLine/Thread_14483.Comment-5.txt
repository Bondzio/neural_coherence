bob, just wanted to say thanks for your help.
after i got off work, i tried to get the router configured with no avail.
fed up, i decided to go to best buy and just purchase a new router, different brand.
when i got the new d-link router back home, i was having the exact same problems.
realizing that there was some kind of severe networking problem with my main machine i switched back over the linksys router and dug out the old pentium ii from the closet, and hooked it back up.
i moved the cable modem over to that machine, then ran the default linksys router configuration program, and i nearly fell out of my chair when it worked on the first try.
i re-installed my network drivers on my other computer and now everything's working beautifully.
thanks again.
