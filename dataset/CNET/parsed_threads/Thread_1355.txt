<s> Recently I put a desktop tower together. </s>
<s> I have a bit of experience adding hardware, downloading software, and some other basic things with a computer. </s>
<s> This is my first time doing it from scratch. </s>
<s> So my problem is my monitor is noticing the graphics card but there is nothing being projected. </s>
<s> I have taken all of the excess hardware out, and have done it piece by piece, still nothing on the monitor. </s>
<s> I took the graphics card and put it in my 5 year old computer and it starts up without a problem. </s>
<s> Now I've ran out of ideas. </s>
<s> Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 Graphics Card: GIGABYTE GV-R645D3-512I Processor: Athlon II X4 640 Ram(DDR3-1866): G.SKILL F3-1866C10D-16GAB Hard Drive: Seagate STBD2000101 Power Source: Raidmax RX-500AF Side notes - I haven't done anything with the BIOS yet because the computer does not have an on-board video. </s>
<s> When you install a graphics card, you usually have to disable the integrated graphics in the mobo or CPU. </s>
<s> If you didn't do that, it's probably your problem. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> the new computer doesn't have an on-board video so what is the best approach to disable one? </s>
<s> I'm thinking trying to hook the new cpu to my old comp log in that way and see if I can disable it there... dono if its realistic </s>
