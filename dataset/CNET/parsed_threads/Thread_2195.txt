<s> Hi, I'm a college student and my roommate is bringing a Lexmark x1185 (I know its a cheap printer). </s>
<s> I would like to connect this printer to my wireless network or be able to connect to the printer through bluetooth. </s>
<s> Now, I know that this printer does not have these capabilities right out of the box, but is there some type of cheap adapter that I can buy for it to give it these capabilities? </s>
<s> Preferably I would like to keep the price below $30. </s>
<s> Thanks, D0LFAN </s>
<s> &quot;bluetooth&quot; = very slow. </s>
<s> You don't want to know how slow. </s>
<s> Don't even consider this unless you value your time. </s>
<s> Instead look to ANY wifi solution. </s>
<s> If you can, try these (shop till you get your price!) </s>
<s> Links only from now on: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=wgps606&btnG=Google+Search (I own 2 of these and I paid the 29 bucks.) </s>

<s> More at http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&Description=Print%20server&bop=And&Order=PRICE but I know nothing about them. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, I will look into these. </s>
<s> I didn't now about bluetooth being slow because I'm new to all this, so thanks for the heads up. </s>
