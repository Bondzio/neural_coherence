Heard anything about them breaking down?
Are they user friendly?
How's the print quality for text and diagrams?
And, can Oki B4100 do manual duplex?
Is Vista supported?
For Lexmark E120N, there's no manual feed.
What is it used for?
And, for Fuji Xerox 203A, does anyone know whats the price of the drum?
