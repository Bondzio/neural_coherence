very well until yesterday when I noticed the time on the clock was wrong and then I saw that the computer no longer knew it had an A drive.
I figured this was a symptom of the CMOS battery going bad.
On my newer computer when the CMOS battery went bad I noticed the computer did some odd things, but they went away once the battery was changed.
This old computer is 17 years old, but it doesn't get used very often which is likely why it's lasted so long.
I wish I had more detailed documentation on the motherboard.
I dug up the receipt that listed all the parts that went into the computer, but didn't see anything which would give more details.
Although in my searching yesterday I found this diagram which appears to match my system http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/motherboards/S/SHUTTLE-COMPUTER-INTERNATIONAL-INC-Pentium-HOT-541.html#.UauUAthwe6E I want to make sure I understand, I should be able to buy an RTC and replace it on my own and hopefully fix all of this?
