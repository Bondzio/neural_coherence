well david it sounds like the mouse plug may be the culprit.
check the plug and make sure nothing is caved in.
if you have another usb mouse squeeking around try it.
if not you may want to go to your nearest animal shelter and get a new one.
and life goes on... jack p.s.
i'm really sorry.
i just couldn't resist!
