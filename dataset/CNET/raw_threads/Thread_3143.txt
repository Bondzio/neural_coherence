It was working fine for the past month, but today something strange happened. I had my HDD connected and it was working fine, but then when I had no programs open or anything running off the device, I pulled out the USB cord to put the drive away. My computer gave an error message in the taskbar saying that there was some 'fail to write' error. I didn't think anything of it because I have seen that message before and the device still worked. Low and behold I try to start up my drive and it does not work. I did not change anything since I last used it. I plug it in, the light blinks red (usually it just opens the drive folder) and then doesn't do anything. Windows says it can recognize it, but I cannot access it at all. If I click on the device menu, it never opens UNLESS I remove the device. Nothing works unless I remove the USB drive. I tried system restore and it did nothing. I tried it on another computer and the same thing happened. It must be the drive. I have a lot of stuff on the drive that I do not wish to be gone, and I would like to know what I could possibly do. I have already emailed Aluratek about it.

What can I do if there is no way to access my drive? It just locks up my computer and never loads.

But that's not very damage resistant and pulling the USB cable without asking the OS to eject or stop the drive is asking for trouble. What next? Try recovery tools like these: GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY Good luck with that. Bob

The names are easier to find with a search engine. Try GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY at google.com. I don't like to post links since the address can change and others may have the same issue. Bob

You interrupted its working, which doesnot allowing it to work properly. As you have cheked your drive with other system. But you dont need to worry at all as Optimum Data Recovery Inc.is a best data recovery company capable of recovering lost data from a number of storage devices.You can contact them by calling on 800)580 4959 Just follow the link http://www.optimumrecovery.com/

Hi Bob, i hate to cut in here but i have been reading these posts in hopes to learn how to recover my data back from an external hdd. To get to my question - I am trying to run GETDATABACK for FAT32( im almost positive that was the formatt) this program did find my drive and also showed fat32 files...as soon as it started to skan this disk i got an I/O error on sector 0...I continued...not 5 seconds later there was another bad sector and I/O error.. Should I continue with this scan or should I abort? - I am new to CNET so again i hope i'm not butting in

All of my computer knowledge is self taught. So this data recovery software is telling me to create a bootdisk or a bootable cdrom to run dispatch. so do i need to create a boot cd or my other option is to &quot;EXTRACT DISPATCH from archive and save to root of (optional hdd)&quot; If i just need to extract then i would pick the hdd that i'm trying to recover or my actual internal hdd. I hope i'm not being to Simple mined here!
