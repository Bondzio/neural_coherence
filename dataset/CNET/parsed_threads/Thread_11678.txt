<s> I have replaced my video card (ATI 1800X Wonder Card) with the new Radeon 3870. </s>
<s> I have tried using the Wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870. </s>
<s> It gives me 2 extra displays, but I don't need them and disabled those displays. </s>
<s> ATI Tech Support said it doesn't support the 1800X anymore so I cannot get any advice from them. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine. </s>
<s> They are both PCIx. </s>
<s> I hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> But you'll have to use a current OS like XP with SP2, latest BIOS, motherboard drivers etc. </s>

<s> I will double check again but I installed the new Asus Magnus motherboard, that has just been released, so I believed it has the most recent BIOS update. </s>
<s> Will check though. </s>
<s> Also have XP with SP2 and keep up with all updates. </s>
<s> It seems something will not let me access Multimedia drivers, even though I cleaned them out (including Registry) and reinstalled the latest from ATI. </s>
<s> OOps! </s>
<s> MB is Maximus Formula Special Edition! </s>
<s> But having a new motherboard is no sure sign it has their latest BIOS. </s>
<s> The boards are made, shipped via cargo ship, sit in warehouses for months and meanwhile bugs are found, fixed. </s>
<s> No one updates the boards prior to final shipment. </s>
