1.1.1	Hi, I have a desktop with a motherboard that has DDR2 ram on it.	St
1.1.2	I would like to know if i can mix and match DDR2 and DDR3 ram or will it work if i just switch to DDR3?	Ques
1.1.3	All help is GREATLY appreciated!	St
1.2.1	I don't think so.	St
1.2.2	DDR3 is so much cheaper.	St

1.4.1	Very few machines support both on the motherboard at the same time.	St
1.4.2	HOWEVER, a video or other card may use other types or RAM.	St

1.5.1	some systems or motherboards that are specifically designed to accept either DDR2 or DDR3... the Biostar TP43E.is one example.	St
1.5.2	Bottom line it depends on your specific system....but highly highly unlikely for most systems.	St
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
