hello, today i got my 7.1 usb external sound card from startech (  ).
the s/pdif out works like a charm, but when i plug my roccat kave 5.1 headset in, i only get 2.1 sound (front speakers).
i cannot get the other speakers to work.i installed the driver from the cd i got with the sound card.&lt;div&gt; how could i get it to produce 5.1 sound instead of just 2.1?
computer specs:&lt;div&gt;laptop with windows 7 home premium 64-bit intel i7 2ghz, 6gb ram &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; thank you in advance
