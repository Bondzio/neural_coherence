I have very little knowledge of this technology. What hardware will I need to convert from dial-up to wireless? Will this probably enable me to connect to the Internet in the average RV park? Thanks.

It will connect to the wireless network, then you'll open Intenet Explorer, or Mozilla Firefox (whatever browser you use), and you'll be on the Internet. You may have to 'tweak' some settings if your browser is set to always dial your ISP (dial-up connection) when opened.
