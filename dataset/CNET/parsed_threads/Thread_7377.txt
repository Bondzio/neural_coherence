<s> I just installed a 160 GB and W2K new install, the partitions in fat32 and large HD support. </s>
<s> After I set up all my progs I wonted to create an image of the HD. </s>
<s> When Drive Image restarted the computer, something stopped it from booting. </s>
<s> It was like the HD was missing, or had no OS installed, or the boot log was gone. </s>
<s> I look up the WD and MS help and no one could help. </s>
<s> So I reinstalled the W2K and all the Programs form the beginning again, and after I installed the Norton A/V and reboot, the same thing happened all over again. </s>
<s> Here my fault because I left the NAV CD in the drive and I gat the choice menu (boot from HD, or from CD) at 1 second to boot the computer stopped responding??????? </s>
<s> What is going on? </s>
<s> Any one observed this before? </s>
<s> My computer is an old PII 350 Mhz with 384MB RAM. </s>
<s> Then I switched the 160 GB HD to slave position and used my other HD, I was trying to replace, in master position and the machine boot as usual and I can see and access all the directories on the 160 GB HD. </s>
<s> That's beyond the support of the Windows 2000 CD even if you slipstream in SP4. </s>
<s> A registry key is still incorrect. </s>
<s> How do I know? </s>
<s> I have a similar issue and have yet to recreate a new 2000 SP4 CD with the fix noted at.... http://www.48bitlba.com Till you have time to digest all this, stick with what works. </s>

<s> along with an 80 wire IDE cable. </s>
<s> This post is confusion. </s>
<s> Lets forget about the drive image problem for the time being; Did the system boot up after you installed the OS? </s>
<s> Did you install the 160GB HDD. </s>
<s> with a controller (PCI card)? </s>
<s> If not what method did you use to have the 160GB recognized? </s>
