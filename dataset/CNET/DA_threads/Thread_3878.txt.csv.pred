1.1.2	but here 's the really strange bit , i have re-installed the operating system on my computer , and it still does n't work with this one ... .i do n't understand it , my pc itself may be damaged because several of the problems that mad me re-install the operating system still occur ( e.g loss of sound until i go into stand by , hibernation , or restart .
