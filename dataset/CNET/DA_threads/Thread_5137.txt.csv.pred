1.1.1	I am going to set up RAID 0 with my laptop, since it supports a second hard drive.	St
1.1.2	I am deciding between these setups: 2 160GB hard drives at 5400 RPM for $215 2 100GB hard drives at 7200 RPM for $150 (already own first one) The good thing about the 160GB option is that I could use the old 100 GB drive for backup, and get an enclosure for it.	St
1.1.3	What's making this decision difficult is the drive speeds.	St
1.1.4	RAID 0 will speed things up, but will 5400 RPM be enough for games like Team Fortress 2?	St
1.1.5	Running Vista Home Premium, too.	St
1.1.6	Greatly appreciate the help, Brian	Polite
1.2.1	I just received a 750GB SATA 7200RPM drive today for 103 bucks.	St
1.2.2	see http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WD7500AACS-R&cat=HDD For your one drive I could have 2 750's vs. your pair of 160GB drives.	St
1.2.3	Why is your price so far out of line?	St

1.4.1	Prices are what they are where they are.	St
1.4.2	But if game performance is an issue don't look to hard disk speeds to get a boost.	St
1.4.3	That only helps on the initial load time and no where else.	St
1.4.4	Hope this is clear enough.	St
1.4.5	-&gt; Areas that do help.	St
1.4.6	RAM and better video chipsets.	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	The price for getting a second 100 GB 7200 RPM hard drive won't change, since I have to get the same exact drive.	St
1.5.2	For the 160 GB drives, I think I'm stuck there too, since I don't think you can buy the special secondary hard drive bracket that replaces a cd drive.	St
1.5.3	Thanks for the help!	St
1.5.4	I will quit thinking about RPM speed, and focus on how much memory I want.	St
