<s> I have a hard drive that has been acting funny recently. </s>
<s> Every time I restart the computer, the hard drive partitions erase themselves. </s>
<s> This first occurred when I restarted for avast update (I was running XP). </s>
<s> The computer can see the hard drive, and I am able to reinstall the OS (windows 7) and run it. </s>
<s> I've tried reformatting it twice in the past two days and that hasn't worked. </s>
<s> The computer is a custom built and the hard drive is a 750 GB Western Digital WD7500AADS-00L5B1. </s>
<s> Do I need to replace my hard drive, or is there a fix? </s>
<s> With the OS missing, you'd get some sort of boot error. </s>
<s> Unless you put that drive in another machine or booted from a utility disk that could provide partition information, it would be difficult to know that this was happening. </s>
<s> What error are you seeing and how did you make this diagnosis? </s>
<s> I did get a boot error, but I ran Ubuntu Live from a CD and saw that there were no partitions on the drive. </s>
<s> Sorry, i forgot to mention what error I got. </s>
<s> The boot screen said something like cd disc boot fail or something similar. </s>
<s> I can't remember exactly. </s>
<s> But I had my boot order go from hard drive to disc drive, so it skipped the hard drive. </s>
