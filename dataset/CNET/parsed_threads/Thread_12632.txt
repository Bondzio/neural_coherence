<s> I currently have a quad Amd Phenom 9600, 500 gig hard drive, 4 gigs ram, nvidia geforce 8800gt windows vista 32 bit. </s>
<s> super multi dvd+rw dl w/lableflash. </s>
<s> www.newegg.com Hands down all time BEST place to buy hardware! </s>
<s> super cheap + huge selection + very well organized site Downside is they don't offer any technical support so you would have to contact the manufacturer for that support. </s>
<s> Lots of people also like TigerDirect.com. </s>
<s> They say it is super cheap, but I don't like it that much because it is very poorly organized. </s>
<s> Fry's is supposed to be really cheap as well although I've never been in one because it is so far away. </s>
<s> newegg is pretty big on these forums (to the point I've wondered which posters work for them) -- i've used them and have liked them, didn't particularly like tigerdirect, did like pacificgeek.com and geeks.com. </s>
<s> I've also found a lot of things on ebay, particularly looking for older/rarer items. </s>
<s> The downside with any of those on-line companies is timing, expense of shipping, and the vagaries of buying things you can't actually see. </s>
<s> For example, I had to return a motherboard I bought on-line. </s>
<s> That required a phone call, wait for RMA email, then I had to pack it up and ship at my expense, and a unnecessarily long wait for the credit to be run thru to my card. </s>
<s> In contrast I've also had a CPU that was dead on arrival. </s>
<s> But since I got it at a local store, I took it back, they did some testing right there to confirm it was defective, and I walked out with an immediate replacement. </s>
<s> To be honest, I paid $30 more for that CPU than I would have at the cheapest online or ebay. </s>
<s> But I was able to finish the build the same weekend I started it. </s>
<s> On-line shopping, if anything is backordered, returned, or anything like that, you're waiting for at least another weekend to actually get your work done. </s>
<s> As far as having great stuff, it's all the same stuff. </s>
<s> A Phenom is a Phenom, etc. </s>
<s> regardless which store sold it. </s>
<s> I'll be honest, there's a good handful of newegg receipts in my email, and I've liked them. </s>
<s> But you have to understand stores like them have zero service or support. </s>
<s> Until you need it, &quot;service&quot; is rather nebulous. </s>
<s> But it has a real value, as does your time. </s>
<s> newegg's site is great with it's advanced search. </s>
<s> once i figure out what i want, i price check with zipzoomfly, and mwave. </s>
<s> buy.com has more mainstream stuff and free shipping so it's sometimes the best price for monitors, hard drives, and even some specific video cards and power supplies, etc. </s>
<s> Provantage has a lot of stuff that NewEgg doesn't ZipZoom, as mentioned here, is very limited but often has the best price. </s>
<s> I've dealt with them. </s>
<s> What I do like about NewEgg is their pictures of the products. </s>
<s> They are by far the best at giving you an idea of what you're getting...inside and outside of the box. </s>
<s> Provantage does have a lot of the better brands....particularly with networking goods. </s>
<s> I live in they state they are addressed in so they do charge me tax. </s>
<s> Their shipping is cheaper than NewEgg and often the pricing too so the total costs are close. </s>
<s> I've had excellent service from both NewEgg and Provantage. </s>
