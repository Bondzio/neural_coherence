I have an intel motherboard 2.4GHz CPU with HT pc.Though I have enabled Hi-speed in the BIOS and also upgraded the motherboard chipset-865GBF;whenever i connect my external Plextor CD-RW which is a Hi-Speed device, i always get a message saying that 'the device can work faster if connected to another port' I have tried all the USB ports on the pc but the message is the same.
I have WinXP SP2 on this pc.
would appreciate help in solving this problem Thanks
