1.1.1	I would like to be able to keep the PC in my bedroom , but be able to use it in my living room by using another monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse .	St
1.1.2	So I was looking for a longer monitor cable , about 50ft .	St
1.1.3	Right now I have it connected with the monitor cable that came with a Dell monitor .	St
1.1.4	I guess your standard monitor cable .	St
1.1.5	So I just want to buy a longer version of that..Will any 50ft VGA cable do ?	Ques
1.1.6	It 's just a regular Dell Monitor .	St
1.1.7	And my computer info is below , just in case you need it .	St
1.1.8	Operating System : Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit ( 6.1 , Build 7600 ) ( 7600.win7_gdr.100618-1621 ) Language : English ( Regional Setting : English ) System Manufacturer : Gigabyte Technology Co. , Ltd. System Model : GA-MA785GMT-UD2H BIOS : Award Modular BIOS v6.00PG Processor : AMD Phenom ( tm ) II X2 550 Processor ( 2 CPUs ) ,	St
1.2.1	That 's quite a distance .	St
1.2.2	You 'll need some expensive cable to get that distance without suffering quality .	St
1.2.3	As well , your wireless keyboard and mouse may not work at all depending on what sort of physical obstructions are in the signal path .	St
1.2.4	You did n't say whether the keyboard and mouse you have now are PS2 of USB .	St
1.2.5	Since you 'd be running 50 feet of video cable , you might as well go that route if you have PS2 .	St
1.2.6	It 's going to be awkward and cheap video cables will give you fuzzy images and poor color .	St
1.2.7	You 'll need one that 's well shielded and high quality .	St
1.3.1	Look at devices like this : http : //www.aten.com/doc_data/pdf_dm/ce700a_specsheet_en.pdf	St
1.4.1	It 's actually not 50 ft away .	St
1.4.2	I measured 25 ft but I needed a little extra cause it has has to go under the house and I thought the cables only came in 25 and 50 ft .	St
1.4.3	I found now they come in other lengths so I 'd probably go about 30ft to 35 ft being that I want extra to go under the house .	St
1.4.4	If the graphics would improve with a smaller cable , like 25 ft .	St
1.4.5	I might be able to make that happen .	St
1.4.6	I really do n't need a perfect picture since I mostly work in my room .	St
1.4.7	This is just for when I get tired of being in my room .	St
1.4.8	You said I 'll need one that 's well shielded and high quality .	St
1.4.9	I Guess that 's what I was asking about .	St
1.4.10	What kind of cable exactly would you get then .	St
1.4.11	For about a 30 ft cable .	St
1.4.12	I mean I know you said high quality but how do you know what 's high quality .	St
1.4.13	You said shielded ..is there anything else I should look for ?	Ques
1.4.14	I think the Wireless keyboard and mouse might be okay since the place I want to have the monitor is in a direct route from my room .	St
1.4.15	In fact I can see it as I 'm typing right now .	St
1.4.16	I figure I could keep the signal near the bedroom door and keep it open when I use the computer in the other room..You 'd have to see a diagram to know what I was talking about , but I found a wireless not that expensive that signal goes for 30ft , and I wanted to get a wirelss keyboard and mouse for my room anyway .	St
1.4.17	So I might try that first .	Sug
1.4.18	I have a USB mouse and Keyboard right now .	St
1.4.19	I was thinking of the possibility of getting extended wires for that .	St
1.4.20	Why do you say to go that route if I have a PS2 connection ?	Ques
1.4.21	Is it not possible to extend a USB connection..or is it too pricey ?	Ques
1.4.22	thanks for the help .	Polite
1.5.1	I 've looked at these and most of them are pretty expensive .	St
1.5.2	The cheapest one I found was over three hundred dollars .	St
1.5.3	The reason I thought of the VGA cable was that I thought I could pay less for that .	St
1.5.4	But the KVM Extenders I 've found so far have been a three hundred dollars at least .	St
1.5.5	Do you know of any for less ?	Ques
1.6.1	After decades of such queries and trying cables I think the answer is what you see here .	St
1.6.2	Imagine the ( poorer ) person who tries cables only to ( re ) discover the issues of long video cables .	St
1.6.3	Just trying to head off the losses .	St

1.11.1	I 'll try one last time..sorry for all the replies but every time time I start to type a subject it submits my posts .	St
1.11.2	So I 'm writing my post first this time .	St
1.11.3	Thanks for the advice .	St
1.11.4	I 'm not sure.. if I were going to pay that much I might just get another computer and share files between the two .	St
1.11.5	I guess it 's a good idea though .	Polite
1.11.6	I 'll have to read more about it .	St
1.11.7	I still might try the cable thing .	Sug
1.11.8	they have one for about twenty bucks and it 's got people saying how great it worked for them in the reviews..I know your shaking your head .	St
1.11.9	LOL But I do n't think I 'll be satisfied until I try it , for that price I 've got to least least try..then I 'll be telling other people not to do it.LOL thanks again.. and sorry about all those non posts .	St
1.11.10	( now I 'll tpye my subject ; )	St
1.12.1	For example some just want to play a video on their HDTV .	St
1.12.2	There are small 99 buck boxes that do that ( Boxee , AppleTV , Roku to get you looking . )	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
1.13.1	Mostly I work with images .	St
1.13.2	I do a lot of artwork and create things with 3d programs .	St
1.13.3	The thing is I 'm just looking to get out of the room once in a while without having to spend a lot of monsey on equipment or a new computer .	St
1.13.4	Also , if I get another computer I 'll have to share files which is n't always easy with the amount of files I have , and the amount of changes I make to them in one day .	St
1.13.5	So even if I could go into the other room to do some grunt work..like put things in order , sort through files..	St
1.13.6	When you work with lot of images and files on your computer it gets overwhelming .	St
1.13.7	Whenever I work on an image I 'm making changes to it and saving the old ones so it 's necessary to constantly clean things up .	St
1.13.8	Or if I need to do some research on the web , stuff like that .	St
1.13.9	So even if I could just save that stuff for outside of my room , at least I would be able to work in another place for a while .	St
1.13.10	I 'm not looking to play games or anything like that .	St
1.13.11	I 'm not really looking to watch videos of course I would n't mind that but it 's not my main focus .	St
1.13.12	I looked up those names you mentioned .	St
1.13.13	I was n't looking for that really but that 's pretty cool and not too expensive .	St
1.13.14	; ) thanks	Polite
1.14.1	In case anyone is reading this looking for help I just wanted to add that I went ahead and bought the RiteAV - SVGA Monitor Cable - 35 Ft. http : //www.amazon.com/RiteAV-SVGA-Monitor-Cable-Ft/dp/B000V1LX3Q/ref=sr_1_11 ? ie=UTF8 & qid=1295821971 & sr=8-11 and it works perfectly .	St
1.14.2	I am sitting in my living room I write this and my PC is in another room .	St
1.14.3	Only a few things to think of before trying this .	St
1.14.4	I already had speakers that reach this room so I bought the cable without audio..you might need the one with the audio..if you 're monitor accepts it .	St
1.14.5	You need either a USB extender or USB 2.0 Hub http : //www.amazon.com/Targus-4-Port-Bend-Adapter-ACH103US/dp/B00180LGXQ for your mouse and keyboard .	St
1.14.6	Or I already had a wireless keyboard and mouse that works up to 30- ft away and I just happen to have a clear path from my computer room to my Living room where the monitor is set up So I set my PC near the door and so for the most part it works great..Sometimes the keyboard gets a little slow..SO I 'm thinking of buying usb extension cable for that.But the mouse works fine .	St
1.14.7	Also this VGA cable I linked to above , only comes in Male to male..meaning you have to have a monitor that has a detachable cable so that you can directly plug it into the back .	St
1.14.8	Other wise you need a VGA coupler..which is not much at Amazon : http : //www.amazon.com/RiteAV-Coupler-Gender-Changer-Female-Female/dp/B000V1PAWQ/ref=pd_rhf_shvl_1 Anyway , I was able to get my monitor to work in another room and i 'm happy with the results .	St
1.14.9	The cost was 13.95 for the cable and I had the wireless set and speakers already .	St
1.14.10	I might get the USB extention cable for the keyboard as it tends to annoy me sometimes .	St
1.14.11	SO that might add another 20 bucks or so but it 's worth it for me .	St
1.14.12	; ) Side note- I also got an extra long HDMI cable - http : //www.amazon.com/Link-Depot-HDMI-Cable-feet/dp/B000IJY8DS/ref=sr_1_11 ? s=electronics & ie=UTF8 & qid=1295822734 & sr=1-11 , and ran that from my computer room to the room next to it where I watch tv .	St
1.14.13	So I can now watch Netflix ( or use the computer ) in my bedroom as well .	St
1.14.14	What 's good about that is It 's a new HD TV and the sound comes through the speakers so did n't have to worry about that .	St
1.14.15	So I was lucky with the cables I bought .	St
1.14.16	I looked at the reviews from people before I bought to make sure it was what I was looking for and what the opinions who actually bought those cables were .	St
1.14.17	MY only complaint is the keyboard which annoys me sometimes but I mostly work with photos so It 's not a deal-breaker for me .	St
1.14.18	Plus I 'll try better batteries or a USB extender before I give up on that .	St
