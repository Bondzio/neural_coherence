Don't buy the 988 if you expect to get a rebate!
I purchased an FP988D through Tiger Direct in November, submitted the rebate forms immediately, and 5 months later have yet to recieve my $90.
I've spoken with TY, the head of their rebate department, he's a *@#%!?
liar, not mention his &quot;Flaming&quot; temper when I called him on his lies.
Bottom Line - the monitor will cost you $90 more than the advertised price - buy a reputable brand from from a reputable vendor!
