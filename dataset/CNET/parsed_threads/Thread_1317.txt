<s> I installed an Hitachi 500 GB SATA drive, but I can't get Vista to find it. </s>
<s> Well, when I go into Control Panel, System, Hardware, Drives, I can find it. </s>
<s> But I can't find it in Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> It looks like this Vaio already has 2 hard drives, but they must be in a RAID setup. </s>
<s> What do I need to do to get this new drive recognized? </s>
<s> I recently upgraded from XP Pro to Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Where do I go to partition it? </s>
<s> I tried hitting F6 during bootup, but I didn't see anything there or in the Control Panel. </s>
<s> I found Disk Management, and it's formatting right now. </s>
<s> I ran into the same problem - what was the solution? </s>
<s> I found the answer - hit F2 on boot up and config the SATA 4 to 'ON' -then rebooted. </s>
<s> Showed up as F Drive. </s>
