Every week I have someone at the office show up with a corrupted Fat32 volume.
It's too prone to damage.
Just do this.
Copy a file to it and then yank the USB cord.
Our NTFS volumes survive and I can kill the Fat32 volumes on demand.
Yes we can format them and start over but where's the fun in that?
