hey guys, i'm just about to buy a computer system that consists of the following components and was having trouble deciding on which video card to choose.
the basic specs of the computer are: asus a8n-sli motherboard amd dual core 3800+ cpu 1024mb ddr-533 memory 200 gig western digital hard drive 19&quot; widescreen lcd monitor 16x liteon dual layer dvd-rw i was originally going to go for the nvidia geforce 6600gt 256mb pci-express graphics card.
however i can upgrade to the geforce 6800 xt 256mb pci-express video card very cheaply.
i was just wondering whether it was worth going to the 6800xt and whether it is a good card?
or am i better off sticking with the good old 6600gt?
i may also be able to stretch my budget to afford the geforce 6800gs 256mb pci-express card, but would laying out the extra money for the 6800gs be worth it considering i am on a budget, or am i better off going the budget route and sticking with the 6600gt?
i am doing a computing and multimedia degree at university (college) so i will mainly be using the computer for internet, typing documents, browsing the web, burning cd''s/dvd's, java programming etc.
i do play games occasionally but not all the time.
any help is much appreciated as i am leaning towards the 6600gt but was wondering if there was a better option.
cheers benny
