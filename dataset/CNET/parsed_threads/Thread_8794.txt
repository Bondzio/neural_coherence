<s> Also be sure that your Compaq has the switch for Wifi on/off to the on position. </s>
<s> Thanks for the try at details but no model number so I can't look at the machine and see if it's one with known issues. </s>
<s> Test your machine at a free wifi spot and if it works there consider the wifi router you are trying to connect to defective. </s>

<s> If so make sure it is broadcasting the SSID. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I think there isnt any problem with the router or the latop because i said that it got connected once. </s>
<s> Could u post how to configure a wireless connection from the scratch </s>
<s> In our forum sticky and your router manual. </s>
<s> I would be duplicating all that PLUS there is that issue with the BROADCAST FLAG. </s>
