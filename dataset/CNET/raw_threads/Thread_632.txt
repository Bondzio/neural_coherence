A faster front side bus (FSB) would help. 800 speed FSBs are older and will soon be obsolete. Nvidia 8500 are old cards now. This PC may have a very difficult &quot;up grade path&quot;. This means you may get stuck with what you buy because of few options as up grades. This PC may run very hot. What has been done to cool it down? Find a good gaming PC and use it's specifications as a guide to find your new PC. The devil is in the details, in other words ... the more you know about PC specifications the better. Once you think you know enough about specifications then learn some more then try to keep up with the changes. This thread is untracked.
