<s> While connecting an HP PSC 1510 usb printer cable to the back of a PC during software installation I noticed a little &quot;arcing&quot; (very small sparks) between the usb port and the cable. </s>
<s> Can this be considered normal? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help - rjjp </s>
<s> Not good. </s>
<s> There is a static buildup that needs to be drained. </s>
<s> And that static will destroy chips. </s>
<s> Was the printer plugged into a power outlet first? </s>
<s> If not, always plug external powered equipment into the power outlet before connecting it to the PC. </s>
<s> The ground on the power plug will drain any static charge. </s>

<s> Thanks for your suggestions Wayne, but the printer was already on when I plugged in the usb cable to the back of the PC and the power cable is earthed (theoretically there should be no static)- so Im still somewhat baffled. </s>
<s> You might touch the plug to the case before plugging it into the USB port. </s>
