if you look back at the days before ip networking became the accepted norm, you found all networking was proprietary.
you had microsoft, 3com, novell, sun and about a dozen others so when tcp/ip or internet protocal went public it looked to be a front runner and here we are.
i can't duplicate the history here.
so why are we here?
dough, clams, moola, greenbacks, etc.
the other reason it can't just connect is the code behind it all doesn't do that.
