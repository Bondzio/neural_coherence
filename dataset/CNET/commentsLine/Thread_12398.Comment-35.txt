i'd like to see how you are liking your xerox phaser now that you've had it for a few months.
i am considering your model and the 8560. it appears that 8560 will have better resolution and therefore might be worth the extra money?
i have found that some reviewers feel the ink runs out too quickly and is far more costly per page than xerox's specs would lead us to believe.
what have you found to be true?
unfortunately, there just aren't as many reviews of the 8000series as of the 6000s.
