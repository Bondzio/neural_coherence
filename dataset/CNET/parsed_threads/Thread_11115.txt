<s> Newer to computers: Just out of curiosity...I'm thinking about extra storage and flexibility in the case of something ever going wrong with my computer. </s>
<s> I've looked at internal and external hard drives. </s>
<s> If I were to buy an external (usb), such as an Iomega 40gig, would it be possible to install Windows XP on it and use it as the main hard drive. </s>
<s> New to all this stuff. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> It is highly unlikely your motherboard will support booting from a USB device. </s>
<s> You would be better off buying a USB hard drive case and getting your own internal drive, you will have an option to pick the size and you can swap drives when you want to. </s>
<s> XP doesn't provide support for such even if your machine could boot from such. </s>
<s> Let's call this one a deadend. </s>
