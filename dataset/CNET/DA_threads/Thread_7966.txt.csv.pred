1.1.1	Hi there I want to wirelessly connect 2 routers together to connect parts in my house ( large house ) where the wifi signal is weak from the main wifi device and I need some help on how to set this up .	St
1.1.2	Router # 1 is the new Apple AirPort Extreme ( 2013 ) plugged into an ADSL modem in the lounge .	St
1.1.3	Router # 2 is a Netgear R6300 and is in the downstairs bedroom .	St
1.1.4	How can I connect these 2 wirelessly to make the downstairs bedroom and other rooms downstairs have a strong connection .	St
1.1.5	I do n't want to run a wired connection due to logistics .	St
1.1.6	Both routers are 802ac so I presume the 2 routers will have a strong connection between them with 802ac and the beam technology built in .	St
1.1.7	But I need to know how to set up each router to make this possible ?	Ques
1.1.8	And also do I connect to router # 2 ( Netgear ) with a LAN cable into my downstairs computer or will that be able to distribute a wireless signal to seperate devices downstairs ie computer/ipad/iphone ? ?	Ques
1.1.9	Ideally I would like to connect my iMac via a cable but also be able to use my iphone and iPad downstairs aswell off of the Netgear router via wireless if this is possible ?	Ques
1.1.10	I have been reading a few forums and believe you can bridge routers or set them up as access points but I need some help on the specifics on my set up please !	St
1.1.11	Any advice will be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.12	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Maybe you could do this if the netgear was on the internet connection since from what I read the apple router can be a repeater ( that 's no bridge . )	St
1.2.2	From what you wrote I doubt you want a bridge but may want a repeater .	St
1.2.3	As in all these setup the repeater is placed halfway from the source to the final destination .	St
1.2.4	I 've lost count how many times that they put the repeater in the room that had bad coverage .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	give you some tips unless you 're on a tight budget .	St

1.4.1	The tip about pulling the WiFi back to 802.11g is almost a trade secret .	St
