But check the old adapters to see what they were rated at.
I do know these can burn out if the old laptop battery is less than stellar.
The ONLY thing I am religious about is to never move the laptop with the power plug in.
I've repaired more than my fair share (other peoples).
It's a lesson I learned by others making that mistake.
