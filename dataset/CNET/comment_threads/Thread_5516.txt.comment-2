Some more additional info...
If I go into system then hardware profiles, it says something to the extent of &quot;Drive A is using MS-DOS compatibility mode file system&quot;, but won't let me open drive a: in ms-dos mode.
This is why I think that an external FDD (PCMCIA) is not considered as a drive.
