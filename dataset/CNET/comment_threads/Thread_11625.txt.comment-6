Windows CE machines are unlike your common PCs.
There are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the OS.
If it's busted then its busted.
I can only guess you are new to Windows Mobile/CE.
I'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on Windows Mobile, Embedded XP and more.
As I am not the person who created this image, I can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue.
