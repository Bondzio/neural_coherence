I have two 80 gb hard drives.
I've been thinking about using one just for my pictures,gif's,video,and music.
Hoping that they would be safer on a seperate drive.
Is this idea valid or not, and are there any other better ways to protect my files, other than the fact that I must back up my files.
I do use an antivirus program and firewall,and don't download anything questionable.
