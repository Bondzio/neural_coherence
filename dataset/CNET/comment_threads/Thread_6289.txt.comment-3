I had a similar problem last week and I think I fixed it.
I changed the channel my network was operating on (I believe the default is 11).
I went into the wireless configuration screen and changed it.
After that it seemed to work fine, again.
I think a neighbour with a more powerful router might have been interfering with my signal.
Hope that solves the problem.
