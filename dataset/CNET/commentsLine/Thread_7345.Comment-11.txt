i have tried everything you've suggested, individually and in various combinations.
firmware is current.
broadcasting in ssid.
wpa security.
turned off wi-fi.
adjusted firewall settings.
turned off firewall.
turned on wi-fi but set it to a b/g signal instead of n. router setup is correct.
made sure no d-link filters were on, as far as i could tell.
and the results on my wired desktop pc were exactly the same: about 80% lower than normal.
so unless anybody has anything else i should try, my question becomes: is there any way to know whether the dir-655 router simply won't work with my modem vs. just having a bad router that needs to be replaced and should work fine under normal circumstances?
