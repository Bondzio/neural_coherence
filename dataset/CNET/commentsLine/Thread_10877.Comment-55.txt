even if the pillow is not physically blocking any of the air vents it is still acting as a large layer of insulation under the laptop and may not be allowing any heat to escape from the bottom of the laptop chassis.
this is not a good idea.
you want as much air flow in and around the laptop as possible.
heat is the number one enemy of electronics and excessive heat will shorten the life of your computer.
