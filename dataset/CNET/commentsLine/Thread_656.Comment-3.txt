for all intents and purposes, you're not going to wear out the flash drive.
excluding any h/w faults such as peeled or dirty contacts or esd damage, the flash drive isn't going to wear out.
you may encounter a s/w glitch or such, but these are usually known and can be corrected or googled for a fix.
as for esd(static) damage be sure to ground yourself before handling your drive, after all the drive runs on 5vs, static can generate well beyond that and having it in your hand then touching the usb port can(and has) be discharged through it causing weird or unexplained headaches of why things don't work in the future.
