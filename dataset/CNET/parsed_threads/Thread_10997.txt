<s> I'm looking to buy another HP 895Cse Deskjet inkjet printer to replace mine which is almost 7 years old so I went to Ebay and did a search. </s>
<s> A few popped up but one of real interest is being sold with a Dell Dimension 4700 desktop PC. </s>
<s> The high bid right now for the pair is $90.00; shipping is free. </s>
<s> I really don't want the computer; it's the printer I want but I'm going to wait and see if the pair sell because the buyer has a &quot;Reserve Not Met&quot; listing for the item. </s>
<s> What kind of a problem could I run into if the seller contacts me after the bid closes and nobody is the high bidder and offers to sell both items to me for my low bid price? </s>
<s> The seller claims the computer once belonged to his son who bought it new but used it only 2 months. </s>
<s> From photos of the computer on Ebay it does look like it hasn't been used much but I think of things like the computer in 2 months time could be infected with viruses and spyware; could have other hidden problems. </s>
<s> Should I stay clear of this item if the seller contacts me to sell it and the printer to me? </s>
<s> How long ago were Dell Dimension 4700's first introduced for sale by Dell if anyone knows? </s>

<s> PC World has a review of that model dated from 2005, in which it states that it's a revision of the Dell 4600. </s>
<s> I hate to ask, but why would you want to pay up to $90, for a used printer? </s>
<s> You can get a newer model for less then 1/2 of that at NewEgg. </s>
<s> I have no intentions of paying $90.00 for a used printer; the printer which is an HP 895Cse was and still is in my opinion a very good HP inkjet printer. </s>
<s> I contacted the seller about it; he informed me if nobody bids his asking price for both the computer and the printer he might consider selling me just the printer. </s>
<s> The reason I want it is to pair it up with an old desktop I have which is an old WIN 95 machine but again I wouldn't pay $90.00 for it. </s>
<s> $45.00 max maybe but not $90.00. </s>
<s> I bought one previously off of Ebay almost 3 years ago; the printer including shipping set me back about $65.00 and that used printer has been a very good printer for my $65.00 investment. </s>
<s> I had never bought anything off of Ebay until that time. </s>
<s> Ebay's pretty good but you have to do your homework and hope who you deal with want stick it to you because you can get taken if you don't watch out. </s>
<s> If HP still sold brand new inkjet printers for WIN 95 computers I wouldn't be trying to buy one from Ebay but would I pay $90.00 for it; no I wouldn't unless I knew the printer was a brand new one which had never been used which would be very rare. </s>
<s> I paid $349.00 for my first HP 895Cse more than 9 years ago. </s>

<s> Ahh, Win95. </s>
<s> Ok, that makes more sense then and I can see the problem. </s>
<s> Good luck in your search. </s>
