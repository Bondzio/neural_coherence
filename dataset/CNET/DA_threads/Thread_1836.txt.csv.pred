1.1.1	if you read my other post my pc is messed up but the hard drive is perfectly fine.	St
1.1.2	Now there are some very important files on there and i was wondering that if i were to put that hard drive in my dad's pc, what will happened?	St
1.1.3	his pc has XP and XP is also on my hard drive.	St
1.1.4	i was wondering if there is a way i can just get the files out of there?	St
1.1.5	because if i can just get the files i can then move them to my dad's hard drive and erase what on my hard drive and then add it as more storage to another pc	St
1.2.1	Done it myself.	St
1.2.2	Just make sure your HD is set for slave.	Sug
1.2.3	XP will see it as just another drive.	St
1.2.4	Copy what you wish, then do what you want.	St
1.2.5	Your logic is correct.	St
1.2.6	Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.	St
1.2.7	Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software.	St
1.3.1	good thing for me.	Polite
1.3.2	so all i need to do is set it up as a slave and then i will not have any other files?	St
1.3.3	One thing though.	St
1.3.4	On my PC that got messed up i had accounts with password.	St
1.3.5	Someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave?	St
1.4.1	but I've never looked for that type of stuff.	St
1.4.2	Give it a shot, it'll either work or it won't.	St
