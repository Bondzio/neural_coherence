the usual cause is clock speed or fsb set incorrectly in bios.
tell what motherboard and bios you have.
also tell what you did to fix it before.
someone will be happy to help.
one other thing, it's not a good idea to post your email address in the forum.
click on edit profile at the upper left corner and enable your email.
that way your address is hidden from all.
if you start to be deluged with spam email, you'll know the cause.
