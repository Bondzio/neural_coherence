what does OS and DX mean????
I have tried to update with MS but to no avail.I`m in need of some major help.
When I installed it the process said I should use the LTP1 port is that right?
or should I have it set for something else.I`ve never rebooted a system before and didn`t look at all the settings for stuff before we cleaned everything off.I`m at a loss as to why it was ok and now it`s a slow as the preverbial SNAIL!
