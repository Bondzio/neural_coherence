First a hd is not designed for an OS.....it's just a storage device and could not give a hoot what OS or data you put on it.
The maybe part.
Hd's from the w98 era were PATA.
Hd's from the win7 era are SATA.
The cables and plugs are different.
So a quick eye-ball of the old hd connectors and the connectors available in the machine might be of value.
