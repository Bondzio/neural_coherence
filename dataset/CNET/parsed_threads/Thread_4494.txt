<s> Hi all Quick question; I am using Win XP home and when I go into my Device Manager under Display Adapters I have 2 listings - 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out - 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out sec Does this mean I have 2 video cards installed in my machine? </s>
<s> If i look at the back of my machine i only see one (I think). </s>
<s> I am looking to add a second monitor and wanted to make sure I need another before I do anything else. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike </s>
<s> The drivers are installed twice. </s>
<s> This happens sometimes with modems. </s>
<s> Just delete/remove the second one. </s>
<s> that is normal for that ATI card to show one device and then a 'secondary' device and without both installed, the card and its programs won't work. </s>
<s> Believe me...I have the card and screwed the pooch royally by trying to 'fix' this when it wasn't broken. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> that you have dual RAMDAC's ATI cards show up as 2 adapters if they support 2 monitors with nVidia cards they show up as 1 card, but when 2 monitors are installed it shows up as 2 cards ATI just leaves it fully enabled/is slightly different </s>
<s> So i don't need a second video card to run another monitor off this machine? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
