It works in my friend's almost identical laptop, and my laptop is correctly recognizing other usb inputs. The hard drive spins when plugged in, but the led on the exterior of the drive doesn't come on. I'm pretty sure it isn't showing up in device manager or disk management. I've also tried all the ports. I think I read somewhere that some driver updates can screw up the usb's, but the problem only comes up with this hard drive. Here are where I've looked for it: http://imgur.com/PR6oU http://imgur.com/TQN6a http://imgur.com/t6rfk

Use an Y-USb-cable (two connectors, one extra for power) 3. Use a powered hub in between. The combination of #2 and #3 should work, but maybe one of them is enough already. Kees

It should be recognized from the USB port once connected as the OS supplies the necessary acknowledgement. Adding to what Kees has already stated, be 100% sure the USB ports of your laptop are actually enabled. If you installed any s/w to correct, remove or uninstall its not needed. Since, you didn't mention what OS was being used, I assume its Win7. Also, I assume the laptop itself was properly all updated for use to its latest, to include the OS and mtrbd. drivers and possibility bios as well. As for s/w installed, I exclude what maybe WD bundle supplied for better use of the ext. HD, NOT as a driver. tada -----Willy
