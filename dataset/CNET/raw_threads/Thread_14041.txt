But I'm still looking for advice: I am looking to spend $200 - $250. I was going to get a kindle fire hd but was concerned about lack of sd slot plus it's a little bigger than some other 7 inchers, and it's a forked version of Android, so less flexibility, etc. Nexus 7 has got good reviews but no sd slot and minimal speaker (I wold have to use it's bluetooth for external speaker or headphones). novo 7 flame seems to have everything I want including decent display but I am concerned about build quality, the company's reliability, etc. and, even though it's not a nexus, can it use Google Now? You can see I'm all over the place with this decision. Thanks.

If Ainol or the sellers can't answer this one question, this is your tip off that support is non-existant and you are buying another disposable tablet. I'll have my Nexus 7 in hand later today and the KF HD 7 is already in the office if you want me to check something on that one. Bob

How is other navigation - choppy or fairly smooth? And, it is wider than the nexus 7, correct? Is it also longer? Is that difference noticeable? do you think that Amazon will be providing updates to the OS, so that even if it is never the same as Google's (for example, it is a forked version of ice cream sandwich right now), as opposed to Jellybean on nexus or Ainol. If I can sideload through my pc mp4s and mp3s, and access docs through an app like filespro, box or airsharing, and use other apps like splashtop and Picassa like i do currnelty on ipad, I might ber happy with fire hd. Thanks

Sorry but I gotta ask. If you want me to check something specific such as sideloading, I can do that. I will not root this KF HD since it's the office model we use to test our apps. But it appears we can load apps under development so there are other ways other than the Kindle store. I have to stop here because I'd be duplicating the web. There are folk wanting to use these in place of a PC so the KF may come up short as many web sites don't work. Like the video at Yahoo Finance. CNET Videos are fine since they know to support tablets. Bob Bob

But to get the usual sites to work I had to install the Firefox Beta for Android and Flash from an Android forum after I checked off the security box to allow such. Very strange to see what is the leading edge Android tablet to require us to do that today but at least it passed our tests for our apps. Bob

The Novo 10 Hero is 10&quot; tablet that really impresses and also was just released this week and offers the same 1280x800 IPS screen as the Flame and the Flame's strong processor. As for the Flame - overall it is a great tablet - the screen is super nice and the 5-pt Multi-touch is a lot better than the Nexus 7 (Not Sure Why???) but when you zoon in and out on na image - the Flame is much more fluid and non-dragging, -- for some reason the Nexus 7 has a slight drag with the image a bit. One of the first resellers in the U.S. that seems to carry both of these models is a site called TabletSprint.-- they also offfer a few 3G Android tablets as well --

Both about $180 with shipping. I wanted to get the nexus 7 but it has no hdmi. and Kindle Fire HD....bit bulky and not as fast and no camera anywhere. unfortunately these cheaper chinese models have more quirks in their models, and im scared of lack of support.
