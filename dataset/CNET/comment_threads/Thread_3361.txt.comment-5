better antenna, or change the wireless adaptor, or signal booster.
For Antenna, you can make it your self or get a factory made antenna.
Wireless adaptor, its too many brand to choose from.
Signal Booster, also too many brand to choose from.
google this, radiolabs.com, hawking technology, freeantenna, or the basic, linksys, dlink, netgear, etc.
BTW, the distance is not measure between the house.. but it should be measure from device to device, so if possible move the router/accesspoint closer to your house.. place it near the windows that facing your home..
