1.1.1	Hi folks.	St
1.1.2	This strange problem has cropped up.	St
1.1.3	I hadn't burnt a CD in a about two months, and yesterday decided to back up some of my documents.	St
1.1.4	But now, whenever I try to burn a CD, the drive starts off and then the PC restarts.	St
1.1.5	Every damn time.	St
1.1.6	I use Nero 6.0 for burning but the problem persists with Windows burning too.	St
1.1.7	I haven't installed any new devices in a while, and not installed any software that I think would cause a problem.	St
1.1.8	My system is also virus and adware-free.	St
1.1.9	Any recommendations on what might be the problem?	St
1.1.10	Is it the power supply?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	deleting the drivers and check for updated drivers and install them or re-install, which ever.	St
1.3.2	Also, make sure the ribbon cables are seated correctly.	Sug
1.3.3	and life goes on... Jack	St
