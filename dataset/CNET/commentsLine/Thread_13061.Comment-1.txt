i just did some research on the intel website regarding my intel pentium 4 processor number 519 which comes with the emachines t5026.
it said that hyper-threading was turned off for this processor.
why?
does anyone know how i can turn the hyper-threading on or do i need a new motherboard?
thanks in advance.
