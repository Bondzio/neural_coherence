i own a dell computer.
i recently moved.
when i arrived at my new home and hooked up my computer, here's what happened: computer started screen came on and had the message &quot;power save mode&quot; screen went off and no matter if i hit the mouse or keyboard, the screen does not come back on...unless i hit one of the buttons on the screen.
when i hit this button, i see a message saying it is searching and then i get the message that it is in power save mode and the screen goes blank again.
i am a novice/ignorant woman when dealing with computers and have no idea how to trouble shoot this.
can anyone help?!?!?!
thanks so much.
