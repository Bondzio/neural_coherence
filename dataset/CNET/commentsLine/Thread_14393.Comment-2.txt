try the generic reset (power off, remove battery, ac, press+hold power button for 60 seconds, release and test.)
yes i read you tried it but you didn't tell if the ac was removed.
and it's not a &quot;bleed off.&quot; i can only guess some web site wrote that and we now get folk saying this.
but i read you think there is a video card.
very few laptops have such.
less than a percent point (much lower!)
