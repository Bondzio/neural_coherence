just wondering, never seen those in deployment on an AthlonXP/higher K7 but I have heard tell of them on Socket 370 and lower K7's (Athlon's, and older Duron's) and working great but I would personally suggest this one http://store.yahoo.com/directron/cnps7700alcu.html if you'd like Zalman/if your motherboard supports it (as it's an excellent cooler) one thing you need to keep in mind, both of the Zalman coolers listed here go WELL OVER the maximum weight spec'd for Socket A by AMD, which is set at 300g, and both of these easily surpass that the one I linked to however uses a backplate (simmilar to Pentium 4 coolers) which can help in removing some weight from the actual socket http://www.xoxide.com/thermalright-si-97-cpu-cooler.html ^ that is the cooler I have and the cooler I would buy again, and again, if I needed a good Socket A heatsink while it is BIG (that top &quot;level&quot; is 92MM exactly, for a 92MM fan to sit on) it weighs only 280g without fan WITH a fan it's around 400, which is safe (while 300 is the max, you can go over a bit) as long as your not moving the computer around a lot (i.e.
if you LAN party just be a little more careful) http://www.xoxide.com/thsibofork7a.html ^ that is also a decent cooler, it won't have performance on par with the SI-97, but it's cheaper (it does however include a fan) i'm not seeing a weight stated, but i'm guessing it's at or close to 300g (most of Thermaltake's reference style coolers are, by reference I mean simmilar to the stock cooler AMD themsevles uses (Which is just the basic heatsink with a fan on top, no fancy heat pipes or towers) as for tower heatsinks, while they may provide some of the BEST TEMPERATURES YOU HAVE EVER SEEN, they WEIGH A LOT (I believe the Tower 112 is around 900g unladen with fans) they will rip sockets off of motherboards I remember in one review a tester was using an EPoX board that had already died as an example, he put in an old CPU, dropped the board 1&quot; and it bounced the heat sink off, taking the CPU and the ZIF socket (the entire plastic socket) right off the board that destroyed the board, needless to say, and it showed how oversized those are for that application if your using a Pentium 4 (this is a side note) however the tower design heatsinks are excellent, assuming you can mount it correctly and that you use correct fans I have seen 4GHZ (4000MHZ) achived on a Pentium 4 using this cooler: http://www.xoxide.com/clp0025.html do not try this at home (either hitting 4GHZ, or using that cooler on AthlonXP) i'm just telling that to show their effectiveness at cooling most of Thermaltake's higher shelf coolers should be avoided, they would include: SonicTower BigTyphoon The Beetle The Pipe101 and Asus' cooler attempt in the form of StarIce should also be avoided these are being suggested for avoidance given that their almost as big as the motherboard itself (Sonic Tower has mounting points for a pair of 120MM fans (if you've ever seen one, you realize how huge this thing really is)
