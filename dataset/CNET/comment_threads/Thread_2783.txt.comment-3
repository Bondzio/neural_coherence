My wifi DC is 12 v and cable modem is 12 v. You mean they need total 24 v to supply power to each networking, rite?
So i need to buy new power adapter which could supply 24v and the injector.
I thought it could make it in easy way without add something component.
I see, That's clear...:) Btw, Do you ever use Buffalo's Router Infinia wireless N?
what do u think?
thx
