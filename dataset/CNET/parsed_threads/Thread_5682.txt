<s> Bought a Sony VAIO VGN-BZ12VN 2 months ago from http://www.okobe.co.uk The backlight has packed up. </s>
<s> I read some reviews last week on the Sony VAIO VGN-BZ12VN and other people have reported an issue with the backlight. </s>
<s> Is there anyone else who has had a similar issue or knows if this is a common problem or fault with this model of the Sony Vaio? </s>
<s> The Vaio's are expensive so am disappointed that the backlight went wrong so quickly. </s>
<s> I purchased a much cheaper Acer from Okobe at the same time as the Sony and the Acer still works perfectly. </s>
<s> This happened to me too! </s>
<s> I bought a Sony Vaio laptop and the backlight went after 5 months. </s>
<s> I contacted the company I bought it from and they said that it had to go to the manufacturer. </s>
<s> I contacted Sony and was asked to send it back to them. </s>
<s> They repaired it and so far so good (its been 6 months since then). </s>
<s> I was upset though as it cost so much more. </s>
