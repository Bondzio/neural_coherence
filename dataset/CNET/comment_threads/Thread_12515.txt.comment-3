Consulting both my Antec Sonata II case manual & my Gigabyte GA-8I915P Duo Pro manual, I checked and confirmed that the wiring was correct for a AC'97 hookup configuration.
Like I said, the wiring didn't change at all before and after the format; before it worked, now it doesn't, although my drivers and codecs are all the same.
Thanks for yoru input though.
