No that will not work.... System Recovery ... from where?
In Windows as system restore?
This will only restore Windows kernal files.
HP Recovery .... Windows repiar is not the option you want and from your post it appears this is what you did.
Re-boot to the HP Recovery.
Click on the advanced button, Read All data will be lost and system returned to orginal factory settings (words to that effect).
Any other proceedure will render you system usless unless you have the recovery disks.
