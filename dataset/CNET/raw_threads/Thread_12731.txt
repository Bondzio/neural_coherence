I have done a decent amount of research regarding the parts regarding compatibility ect.. Parts I already have: Antec Twelve Hundred RT Case PSU Rosewell/ RBR 1000-m 1000W RT Vista 64 bit Parts I plan to purchase: Processor:Intel i7 920 Mobo: Gigabyte GA-EX58-UD4P LGA 1366 Intel X58 ATX CPU Cooler: Cooler Master V8 RR-UV8-XBU1-GP Ram: OCZ Gold 6GB (3x2 GB) DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Video Card: SLI 2X EVGA 896-P3-1255-AR GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 896MB 448-bit GDDR3 PCI SLI Supported The total cost for the &quot;parts I plan to purchase per above&quot; is $1,186.53 Minus 90 for rebates Plus 20 (b/c from what I have heard OZ never pays the rebates) I am interested to see what others think of this build regarding stability of the system I am somewhat experianced with regards to computer hardware BUT have never actually build a PC. Is there anything else that I should consider like extra case fans? Cables I may run into needing? Any other accessories that I will need or help with this build? Its the small things that I am unsure about. Also, if anyone wants to suggest another build (including AMD or Radion V/C's) please feel free I am looking for all the input I can gather before I make the purchase. If you suggest a build keep it around 1.2k if possible. On a side note I am wondering how difficult it will be for cable management for this case and if anyone has a good example or suggestions for management I would greatly apprciate it. Thanks for your time and input. Jason
