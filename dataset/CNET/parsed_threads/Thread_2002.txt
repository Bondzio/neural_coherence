<s> anyone had good experience with laser toner refill. </s>
<s> I found there are US and UK suppliers for toner refill. </s>
<s> Any one used in the past please tell me more about how and where to order it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> More than once (twice) the refilled cartridge was defective and burnt out the laser printer's motor control board. </s>
<s> If you refill yourself, there is a chance you will toss out a grinding or jammed cartridge, but always check it turns freely. </s>
<s> In both cases, the repair costs exceeded the price of a new printer... Bob </s>
<s> Check to see if the company is using legacy toner (toner made by the same company that makes your machine). </s>
<s> Every manufacturer will say to use only legacy toner, in some machines this may or may not be crucial. </s>
<s> We recently switched our copiers (although they are not laser the fundamental processes are the same) at work and at first there was not problems but we have started to have fusing problems which our techs have attributed to the generic toner. </s>
<s> Also keep in mind with alot home laser printers when you replaced the toner cartiridge you are also replacing the imaging drum. </s>
<s> If there is a defect (e.g. </s>
<s> : lines or dots on your prints, or lines or dots on your prints where you cannot print, if you printed a sheet with all black you would see lines, it depends on which process your printer uses as to which problem you would get) on your drum and you just refill the toner, you're still going to have the defect. </s>
<s> So, check various sources like you are doing, before you start refilling. </s>
<s> I am aware the &quot;universal toner&quot; is not the best stuff to use, but what about those claim to have toner specific formulated for that particular laser printer? </s>
<s> Are these safe to use? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I used to work for HP and lasers were a big part of service. </s>
<s> Of course they're many refill companies out there, just pick one you feel comfortable with, try local if possible(google for for vendors). </s>
<s> The good: its cheap and relatively dependable. </s>
<s> The bad: if it fails, you need to send back for repair/swap. </s>
<s> Further, they're not responsible for any damage. </s>
<s> Next, don't fall for the cheapest supplier out there as they tend to cut corners. </s>
<s> You'll find if in the US, stores like Staples, OffcieMax, and OfficeDepot, etc. </s>
<s> offer refills for less than new but still more expesnive than some online vendor, but at least you have a local source and/or quick turn-around. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did you have any suggestions to whom are supplying good replacement toner, in US and/or UK? </s>
<s> I came across a few of them, just not sure who is good. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I buy local at OffcieMax and found them to be good since I don't buy that often. </s>
<s> Certainly, no clue to any UK sources, sorry. </s>
<s> However, check these websites, http://www.carrotink.com http://www.inkfarm.com I buy inks from them as for toner that another issue, but check just in case. </s>
<s> Samsung and Brother tend to be expenisve alittle more so. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I will try them out. </s>
<s> which kind you are talking about. </s>
<s> If you are talking simple laser toner, I find this one is good, lots of good reviews behind it. </s>
