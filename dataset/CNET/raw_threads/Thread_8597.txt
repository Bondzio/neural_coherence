I plan to buy a SATA hard drive to install along with it in the case (It will be the only hard drive in the PC). Do I have to have the drive in a RAID? Or can I just have it as the primary drive? (I realize there is no secondary drive with a SATA cable). Also, will I be prompted by Windows XP install to install the drivers for the SATA drive (F6?)? Or will Windows XP automatically &quot;see&quot; the drive and start installing to the drive? Thanks for any help you can provide.

Raid is for mid-level workstations and servers. Also, since it's just SATA on the MoBo you will not need to load any other drivers during install... Good luck!
