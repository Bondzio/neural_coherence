<s> I own a Medion computer, running XP home, with P4 2.8 gh proccessor, a gig of ram, a 128mb Nvidia fx 5700 vidio card, and an internal 100ish Gb hard drive&gt; I am not sure of what the power supply is. </s>
<s> My problem is that, occationally, the computer just won't start. </s>
<s> When I push the power button, the computer begins startup, and goes all the way to the screen where it, I think, is listing the hardware, and has a big Energy- or Eco-Star logo. </s>
<s> As the computer starts up, it makes a bit of noise, which is normal, but when it gets about halfway through this page, the sound slowly dies away, and it stops. </s>
<s> I have tried pressing the &quot;DEL&quot; or &quot;F1&quot; key, or what ever it is, to enter BIOS, but all it does it make a beeping sound whenever I hit the key. </s>
<s> This prolem seems to occer after we have neglected to run Ad-Aware Se Personal for a while, and when we run it, we normally find about seven critical objects, but nothing to indicate a virus. </s>
<s> We have a windows firewall as well, and also have the PC-Cillian antivirus program. </s>
<s> We try to run Ad-Aware Se Personal and Spybot Search and Destroy regularly, but whenever we forget, we have to problem. </s>
<s> We normally fix the problem by just turning the computer on and off several times, or occationally we can get into the BIOS and start the computer. </s>
<s> We have tried many different things, and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions </s>
