i always do alot of research before i buy anything.
i've found the motherboards that specifically state that they support frontside ieee 1394/firewire... so if it doesn't have the the fire controller it won't work?
someone told me that the standard front-side connectors on mobo's could support firewire.
i don't think that's true, but since it came from a usually trustworthy source i thought i would verify this.
thanks for the reply.
