bob, i have been thinking(not good) my old windows &quot;me&quot; that the 3970 scaner worked with.
the last time i tried to use it would not power up, any way to get the power start?
i know, but i can use the scanner :)i'm trying to get pictures from some slides with out sending the slide off for a week or two.
