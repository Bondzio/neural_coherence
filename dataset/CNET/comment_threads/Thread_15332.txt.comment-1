I have Western Digital external hard drive that is compatible with both PC and MAC.
It was working fine with both and now it does not work with PC.
When I connect it with MAC, I am able to view all the files and can copy, edit, etc.
However, when I connect it with a PC, I can see the drive but I cannot see the content in the Drive.
What could be the problem with it?
Could I have deleted some of the files?
Is there any way I can do to fix this problem?
Thanks
