my graphics card is good enough for now to run everything smoothly correct?
that's the main thing i'm worried about is that my graphics card is a little out of date.
and that my system won't run windows 7 smoothly.
i'm sure in the future i will be upgrading to a newer one but for now if i don't have to then i don't want to worry about that.
thanks for the help!
