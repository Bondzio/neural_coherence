<s> I want to setup a wireless network in my home but dont know were to start I own two Dell laptops an Inspiron 1000 and an Inspiron 1501. </s>
<s> Both have XP operating systems. </s>
<s> I also have a Dell 926 all in one printer. </s>
<s> Currently to access the internet I go online with an old Windows 98 dial up system. </s>
<s> I want to get rid of this one all together. </s>
<s> Im going with either DSL or cable with my network. </s>
<s> I dont plan on replacing the desktop. </s>
<s> I know that I will need a modem with DSL or cable for a high speed internet access. </s>
<s> If I understand it right the modem will be connected to a router? </s>
<s> After that Im lost. </s>
<s> The Inspiron 1000 has a plug in 1390 adapter the other laptop has a 1490 wireless card installed. </s>
<s> I have used both in WI-FI hotspots without problems. </s>
<s> Do I connect the printer direct to the router or use a device like a Dell 3300 wireless printer adapter? </s>
<s> My 1501 came with Norton Security installed with a firewall. </s>
<s> I know I will need a firewall of some kind to protect my files but dont know how to set it up on the whole network. </s>
<s> I dont even know which router to buy? </s>
<s> I have more questions than answers at this point. </s>
<s> Im in hopes I can find help here for those not at all knowable when it comes to networking. </s>
<s> Your new setup would be wall &gt; dsl modem/router &gt; wireless router &gt; wired/wireless You'll plug an ethernet cable into the wireless router and follow the setup instructions. </s>
