12980	0	90833	1021604	NR	DerfX	3/6/05 6:22 PM	1.11013332E12	Temp/Voltage Sensor Detection	Hello all, I am using an Intel D875PZB board and have used the &quot;Intel Active Monitor&quot; to monitor the temps and voltages on my board since it was new. I also used the &quot;Intel Desktop Control Center&quot; to modify fan settings and tweak other settings in my BIOS. Both are really good programs but I have lost the use of them. I was experimenting with a program called &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and since installing that, I can not get the Intel programs to work any more. I tried UNinstalling the &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and REinstalling the &quot;Intel Active Monitor&quot; but I get the message that says &quot;No Sensors Detected On This Board&quot;. The sensors are there and functioning because I can REinstall &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; and get readings from that but I don't like that program because some of my voltage readings are incorrect and I would rather use the &quot;Intel&quot; programs anyway. I would like to know if anyone is aware of the changes that &quot;Motherboard Monitor&quot; might have made that cause the &quot;Intel&quot; programs to fail. I am hoping that I can reset things back so I can use the &quot;Intel Desktop Control Center&quot; most of all. I tried a System Restore but the Intel programs still don't function and fail when I try to REinstall them. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks

I can't think of anything else that may be pertinent to this situation at the moment but if I missed something, just ask... thanks
