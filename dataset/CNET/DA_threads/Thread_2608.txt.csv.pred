1.1.1	Hello , I am a person who is responsible for system administration in medium size broker 's company ( approx .	St
1.1.2	80 employees ) We have a lot of workers and visitors with Wi-Fi notebooks who want to surf internet it all over the campus .	St
1.1.3	Currently we have something like a dozen of Access Points ( several conference rooms , trading room , lobby etc . )	St
1.1.4	that were configured separately .	St
1.1.5	We have separate network for those APs because I 'm afraid of intruders equipped with wi-fi sniffers who can penetrate into our LAN .	St
1.1.6	One more thing that make life difficult is the fact we had to configure WEP with the same key-phrase so users can surf via any one of our AP 's .	St
1.1.7	What I 'd like to know - is there some kind of simple software that can help me to manage the wireless network easily , including managing access for limited time visitors .	St
1.1.8	Also I 'd like to know who is currently connected , how many users surf via wireless etc .	St
1.1.9	The program must be simple to install and use , since this is only a part of my duties and I do n't want to waste my time dealing with over-sophisticated network management tools ( that cost tons of money ) .	St
1.1.10	Thanks , Evgenek Klein , MNGD	St
1.2.1	To get there , you 'll have to replace all the current WAPs for ones that work with software that does this .	St
1.2.2	Cisco has this feature .	St
1.2.3	But my bet is that you may not be willing to pay for this .	St
