<s> We have 2 computers (1 has an XP Pro OS while the other has a Win98 SE OS) that are connected to the net via a CNSH-800 8-port switch that is hookup to a DSL modem-router. </s>
<s> Our problem is that the connection between the switch and our Win98SE PC has somehow stop working. </s>
<s> No, it doesn't have anything to do with the LAN card or the UTP wire being busted because when we tried to hook them up directly to the DSL modem-router, we could still get a connection. </s>
<s> I think the same is also true for the switch because the connection between it and our XP Pro PC still remains unaffected. </s>
<s> So my question now is this: where do you think our problem lies? </s>
<s> Do you know of any solution to fix it? </s>
<s> eventhough you said you have no problem with your UTP, try other cable... it maybe loose or burnout connector.. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply Gakada. </s>
<s> The switch PORTs are ok when I tested them all using the UTP cabble hook up to our XP Pro PC. </s>
<s> As for the UTP cable hookup to our Win98SE PC, it works just fine when I connected it directly to the DSL modem-router instead of the switch so I don't think it has something to do with the problem. </s>
<s> One more thing, the switch, the UTP cable, and dsl modem-router are all new. </s>
<s> Not even a week old yet. </s>
<s> They even all work just fine until yesterday when I found out that I could no longer access the net via the switch using our Win98SE PC. </s>
<s> By the way, our DSL provider assigned to us one static IP address. </s>
<s> But since we have to 2 PCs I made use of the switch to share the internet connection so I won't have to setup a network with one PC depending on another to get access to the web. </s>
<s> Just assigned IP addresses to both with the first one having a 192.168.X.XX address while the second one having 192.168.X.XX+1 address. </s>
<s> Any more ideas guys? </s>
<s> Gakada, I guess I made a hasty conclusion with regards to your suspicion that I maybe having a loose connector. </s>
<s> Kinda just found out that when I checked my RJ45. </s>
