OK, here goes: I have a Vista desktop, and two XP laptops.
Desktop is wired to the router.
Laptops are wireless.
Printer is connected to the network via Ethernet cable to the ROUTER.
The desktop can see the printer.
It can also see the two laptops on the network.
Neither laptop can see nor print to the printer.
Help!
