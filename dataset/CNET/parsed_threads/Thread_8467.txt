<s> OK, I have perused the posts and web. </s>
<s> It seems the issue I am experiencing with this external from Maxtor is a prominent one. </s>
<s> I have had the HD for about (1) year. </s>
<s> Always on, always connected to the PC. </s>
<s> The other day, it &quot;fell asleep&quot; and I cannot wake it up. </s>
<s> (Upper light constantly blinking) I have read the success others have had with connecting these Seagate drives directly to their SATA ports internally and the computer recognizing the drive, thus restoring all potentially lost files. </s>
<s> Is a bit different. </s>
<s> My HD is the 1 TB model, upon opening the case, it is actually (2) 500 GB drives running in dual mode giving me the overall capacity of 1 TB recognized by my computer as 1 drive. </s>
<s> Has anyone had any luck restoring or getting the computer to recognize a &quot;dual drive&quot; situation outside of the Maxtor One Touch case? </s>
<s> When connected internally, my PC sees the drives as one, but when double clicking on the drive letter I get a &quot;corrupted file&quot; message. </s>
<s> Does that truly mean the info is corrupted or am I missing a step in getting my computer to recognize the dual drives as one internally? </s>
<s> (Bypassing the Maxtor 1 touch III 1TB case electronics) Thanks! </s>
<s> Time to call Maxtor. </s>
<s> Let's hope your backups were current. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am guessing that because you replied &quot;ouch&quot; and there is no way to pair the dual drives outside of Maxtor's magic one touch box my situation is bleak? </s>
<s> I do have a redundant backup, but capacity is not as large as the TB. </s>
<s> So I do not do full backups on the redundant. </s>
<s> Just when I thought I was safe with a single backup drive, now I have to have a backup for the backup? </s>
<s> Where does it all end! </s>
<s> Maxtor will have to share how outside of their hardware. </s>
<s> There is also someone besides Maxtor -&gt; http://www.drivesavers.com But let's be honest here. </s>
<s> Recovery is more money than backups. </s>
<s> Its sad to read that this is not a single drive since the usuals do work most of the time. </s>
<s> Just not on this one. </s>
<s> Is it worth the money to buy another Maxtor dual? </s>
<s> As to backups. </s>
<s> Here's the gruesome truth. </s>
<s> We need at least 3 copies to call it backed up. </s>
<s> Why 3? </s>
<s> Because when one fails we still have 2 copies to retrieve from and if some pest, trojan botches the recovery we have that last backup. </s>
<s> What I find missing from all these drives is the &quot;write protect switch.&quot; Bob </s>
