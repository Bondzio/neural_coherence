I have 2 Dell Dimension desktops WIRED (one upstairs, one downstairs) and 1 brand new Inspiron Notebook WIRELESS with a 1450 wireless card attached to a new Dell TrueMobile 2300. I cannot receive a good signal more than 15 feet away from the router in my house. It's on the top floor and I can not go farther than the next room, not to mention downstairs to the bedrooms or family room. This is a regular house........average sized, no steel walls or anything....just wood and sheetrock with lots of wide open spaces. Is there a more powerful router to buy? What are repeaters, antennas, bridges, access points or airports and would any of them work for me? Each person at Dell I speak to has a different opinion! Help??

I ran into a person who had a wireless router and the antennas were missing. &quot;It should work without them was what the salesperson told me.&quot;!!! 2. The last dozen routers didn't have the latest firmware and had range issues (4 to 10 feet!) Bob
