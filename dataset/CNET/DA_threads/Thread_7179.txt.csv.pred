1.1.1	I am trying to access data on a USB external hard drive (Western Digital WD800U017-001).	St
1.1.2	The data was put on with a Mac.	St
1.1.3	I am trying to access it with a PC.	St
1.1.4	In Device Manager, I can see the drive.	St
1.1.5	In Disk Management, I can see the drive but it has no letter assigned.	St
1.1.6	When I write click the only options available are Delete Partition and Help.	St
1.1.7	It will not let me Change Drive Letter and Paths.	St
1.1.8	If I try to use the diskpart utility from command prompt, I can see the drive with list disk and list partition but not with list volume.	St
1.1.9	If I try to use the add or create volume simple commands I get a message that says &quot;The command you selected is not available with this version of Windows.&quot; My computer is: Windows Home XP + SP2 AMD Athalon 1500+, 512 MB RAM, ASUS A8V266-E Motherboard USB 1.0 It is six years old.	St
1.1.10	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	One other thing I forgot to say was that the drive has no name.	St
1.2.2	No name appears in Disk Management.	St
1.3.1	Sorry, I found the solution here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925196 Something to do with a corrupted registry key.	St
1.3.2	I can see it now.	St
1.3.3	I can't access the data but I can see it in My Computer at least.	St
1.3.4	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	To access the data I found a program called MacDrive.	St
1.4.2	It has a free trial for a week but its pay after that.	St
1.4.3	The free trial is plenty for me but does anyone know a freeware program that does the same job?	St
1.4.4	Thanks.	St
1.5.1	The website to get MacDrive is http://www.mediafour.com/	St
