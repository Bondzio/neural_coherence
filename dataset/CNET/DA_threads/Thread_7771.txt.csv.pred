1.1.1	Seems like D-Link has a problem with these modems , I have had 2 not work out of the box , took the first one back to the store , sent the second back to D-Link for replacement .	St
1.1.2	My cable provider ( Cox ) told me they have had many problems with this modem not working .	St
1.1.3	To make matters worse D-link has very poor customer service .	St
1.1.4	After shipping the modem back at my expense , they are taking over 2 weeks to ship out a replacement .	St
1.1.5	Would not recommend this product to anyone .	Sug
1.2.1	I do n't have such , but I 'm having to update firmware in all such devices before they work .	St
1.2.2	Dlink must mass produce the product , box it all up and expect to fix it later with firmware updates we get to install .	Sug
1.2.3	Some consumers will not or can not deal with this and the product must be returned .	St
1.2.4	You did the right thing .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
