I have always used PCs until I recently started a new job where macs are used. I like the simple design of the iMac but don't want to give up a lot of power and options that the PC seems to offer. How fast is the G5 1.8Ghz compared to the Pentium 4 with 3.0Ghz? I am still far more comfortable using the PC, but if the iMac is the better system adusting will only be a minor problem. If you could give me the pros and cons of each I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks...Nicole

You can find all the old writings out on the web... But if you have nothing but Mac at work, then that will be your new world. It's not that hard to adjust to since the latest MacOS is very nice. The one thing I suggest is to not overexpend on any machine. You'll do fine. And if you have all those Mac owners they usually help on any support issue. If you get the PC, then you get to waste time defending your choice. Since it's &quot;a job&quot;, look at it that way. Bob
