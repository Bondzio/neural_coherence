i had exactly the same problem, and my isp identified it as being a problem with linksys.
i upgraded firmware, but the problem persisted.
the linksys router seems to lose your settings, although the settings appear to be there.
so all you need to do is open the linksys settings page, and click on save settings.
another related problem is if you have more than one network named on the router (eg: 'home' and 'linksys')- i deleted my 'home' network, and run on the default 'linksys' network now, and since then, the problem has not returned.
hope this helps.
