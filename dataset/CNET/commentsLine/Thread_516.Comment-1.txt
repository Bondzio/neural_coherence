the computer, an hp(i can't remember the model at this time) was shut off for a few days while we were out of town.
when we returned, the power strip was turned back on.
when the power button on the tower was pushed the monitor turned on but we heard a &quot;zap&quot; like sound and the pc didn't come on.
i tried changing plugs, power strips, power cords but the computer will not turn on.
we've been able to plug a different computer into the same outlet and it works so we've ruled that out.
can this be fixed?
if so how and how much should it cost?
