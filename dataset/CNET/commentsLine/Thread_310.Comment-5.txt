if you intend on using the ga-6ex, to build a system it will be difficult if you do not have all the information.
here is the information i got, i am pretty sure you have the same.
if you can get the original book manuel you will be lucky.
but to get hardware for it will be hard it would be cheaper to get a barebone kit and start from there.
here is a good barebone that you would not have to spend a lot, just add cpu, memory, hard drive.
good luck wendell h
