&quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; Not a whisper of what make/model or any part and the wattage of the power supply.
I've seen many issues, but you supplied nothing for the forum to comment on.
Start very small.
A piece of cardboard, the CPU/HeatSinkFan(HSF), Power Supply Unit(PSU), Motherboard and a Speaker.
Plug just that on the cardboard and touch the power up jumper with a metal pen tip or jumper.
Beeps are a good sign.
No beeps and one of the four parts are misconfigured or dead.
