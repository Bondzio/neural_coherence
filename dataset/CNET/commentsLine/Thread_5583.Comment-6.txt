test under the control panel-&gt; multimedia&sounds icon and try a sound output.
or do an audio system setup where you config the speaker setup, output, etc.
for best operation.
that depends on the type of chipset you have.
you can try reloading the mtrbd.
drivers for audio as well.
of course check to see that ouput isn't, &quot;muted&quot; or set so low.
if none of this helps, then you may have a bad audio chipset, of course if any &quot;manual&quot; jumpers need to set, do so, check in the manual/docs for details.
under device mgr, verify no red/yellow flags are present, if so, correct them.
good luck -----willy
