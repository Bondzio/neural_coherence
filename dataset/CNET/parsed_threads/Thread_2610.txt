<s> I moved to Linksys after my 2nd Netgear wireless increasing lost range (my first one died outright). </s>
<s> But as it still has a little life in it, anyone know if it's possible to bride the Netgear to Linksys so extend wireless range? </s>
<s> I've also wondered if a MacAirport could be used for the same purpose? </s>
<s> Or do I have to stick with Netgear? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any ideas. </s>
<s> I read your post twice and it appears you don't want what a bridge does. </s>

<s> I have done this with two Linksys wireless-g routers as described here: Connecting Two WRT54G Routers Together . </s>
<s> The same networking principles should apply to connecting two different routers, but there is no guarantee of success. </s>
<s> *** Post the particular router models that you are using. </s>
<s> Maybe someone has done this. </s>
<s> It doesn't fit your situation and is more complicated, but it is possible to wirelessly connect two Linksys routers with the SAME 3RD PARTY FIRMWARE that is capable of implementing WDS. </s>
