1.2.1	Press the reset button in the back of the wireless router for 30 seconds , then power it on .	St
1.2.2	setup should be wall & gt ; ISP modem/router & gt ; wireless router & gt ; wired/wireless Update the firmware in the wireless router .	St
1.2.3	Broadcast SSID ( change this to make connecting easier ) Use WPA security .	St
