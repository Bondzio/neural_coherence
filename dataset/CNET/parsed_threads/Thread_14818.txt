<s> I have a Dell Dimension P3 and a Dell p D dual core towers. </s>
<s> I want to use one mouse,keyboard and monitor to control both units I plan to use a KVM switch with ps2 connectors and vga monitor connection These towers are on dial-up with each using a serial modem to connect to ISP. </s>
<s> Both towers have Windows XP sp2 installed. </s>
<s> My question 1) Will both unit have to continue using there individual modems 2) Will this type connection even work. </s>
<s> Will i be able to logon from either unit so as to keep the P3 updated I am new to networking so any suggestions will be appreciated Ray </s>
<s> The KVM handles the keyboard/video/mouse so to keep things simple why not just keep using the modem? </s>

<s> Bob When you said keep using the modem. </s>
<s> Are you saying to use one modem on each tower. </s>
<s> Which is what I understood but just want to be sure. </s>
