hi!
thank you for your prompt reply!
sorry for my silly question but what do you mean by &quot;canned air&quot;?
something related to the dust settled in the radiator?
it's a product for cleaning electronic stuff like this??
never used it!!
pease tell me what i have to do and whether or not i need to update my bios as well (if so, please tell me how to do that: can i use the above tools instead of the third party software suggested by my bios manufacturer which is not free??
).
