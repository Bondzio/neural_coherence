<s> I have a Mac Mini, running OS X and for ages I have been using an external drive for transferring pictures and videos between friends and family and for backups of a few documents for work etc. </s>
<s> I have never had any trouble using the drive and it has always worked OK. </s>
<s> The drive is an unknown brand, but for a few years it has worked with no problems. </s>
<s> I took the drive round to my girlfriends house to transfer some pictures and I lost my cable somewhere between my house and hers. </s>
<s> The cable supplied with the drive was a USB 2.0, and went from USB A male one end to 2x USB A male on the other end. </s>
<s> One of which I would use to transfer files over. </s>
<s> The other just seemed useless and I never plugged it in to any USB port. </s>
<s> I replaced the cable with a single USB 2.0 cable and the drive powered up, all lights flashing, but nothing appeared on screen. </s>
<s> I tried it on my housemates laptop, and my brothers laptop, both running Windows Vista. </s>
<s> The laptops both installed drivers, and told me that everything was OK - good to go - but then nothing appeared on those either. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with the hard drive? </s>
<s> I assume it is the type of cable that I have bought, as it was working fine before I lost the cable and replaced it with a single USB lead? </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! </s>
<s> Thanks to anyone who can help out! </s>

<s> If via USB you'll need a power source or the right USB cable. </s>
<s> This can confuse some since it might power up but fail when used. </s>

<s> Isn't USB already powered? </s>
<s> The hard drive isn't seperately powered, and only uses 1 cable? </s>
<s> Are there different types of USB cable I am unaware of? </s>
<s> One USB port is only 500 milliamps and every drive I see needs a little more than that. </s>
<s> So that is they they had two USB connections. </s>
<s> I think you found the cause. </s>
