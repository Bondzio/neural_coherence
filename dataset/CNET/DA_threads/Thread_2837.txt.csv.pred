1.1.1	Currently I 'm a very frustrated PC customer that has always wanted to go to Mac , but it was too expensive .	St
1.1.2	Now with the release of the Mac Mini ( http : //www.apple.com/macmini ) , it is now an option .	St
1.1.3	My questions are the following : -- Concerning clocking speeds , what does the 1.25 G4 compare to in the PC world ?	Ques
1.1.4	-- Can I put my PC RAM or HDD in this and make it run ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	It 's probably comparable to an older Pentium 4 .	St
1.2.2	The G4 chip is kind of old and is n't really that powerful when compared to many of the newer processors .	St
1.2.3	I BELIEVE the MacMini should run on standard , PC2700 non-ECC 184-pin DIMMs .	St
1.2.4	The HD SHOULD also be a standard 3.5 & quot ; .	St
