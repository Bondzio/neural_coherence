1.1.1	Windows 98SE I installed a new Albatron MX480E video card.	St
1.1.2	All seems to be working but when I go to Control Panel for display adapt.	St
1.1.3	and click on settings to set the resolution, I can't seem to get one that is just right.	St
1.1.4	One setting causes the print to be so large that it over fills the screen and I have to keep using the up/down and left/right arrows to see it all.	St
1.1.5	The next setting up causes the print to be so small I really have to strain to read it and my eyes really suffer by days end.	St
1.1.6	Is there any way to create something inbetween?	Ques
1.1.7	I don't remember the exact numbers but it's like 800 X 600 and then jumps to 1048 X 765 - I need the pointer to stop somewhere inbetween.	St
1.2.1	&quot;800 X 600 and then jumps to 1048 X 765 &quot; Then likely 1200x1024...	St
1.2.2	These are the usual selections and standard numbers the PC display has settled on after about 20 years.	St
1.2.3	You can tackle your issue in another way.	St
1.2.4	Change the font sizes in the Display Properties to your liking.	St
1.2.5	But some never can get it just so.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Worked great!	St
1.3.2	Thanks.	St
