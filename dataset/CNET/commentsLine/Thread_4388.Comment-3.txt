however, many flat cables have two drive connectors, not one, a point which the narrator did not cover.
did you have a question there?
one connector or two, it doesn't matter.
if you have only one drive, put it on the end of the cable.
i have round cables on my home built.
one cable, two connectors for my two hds, and aonther for my two optical drives.
