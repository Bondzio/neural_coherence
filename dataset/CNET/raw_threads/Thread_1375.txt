I'm not sure if you are asking if you can put an AGP card in there, or put an AGP slot in there, but either way, the answer is no. If you are wanting to put a graphics card in there, it needs to be a PCI express card. Those are better than AGP anyway; they offer faster transfer rates.

If it is an AGP slot you can not put and PCI Express card in that slot. If the slot is a different color than your PCI slots it most likely is a video card slot, but you got to make sure which one AGP or PCI Express slot. Is this a computer you built or is it store bought. If it is store bought supply us with the make and model #. Thank You: Wendell H

I did not go to the site and should have trusted the model # that was given. Thank you for reminding me trust first until proven wrong, in this case the model # was correct. I would have given the same info if there was know model #, but there was. Thank You Very Much: Wendell H
