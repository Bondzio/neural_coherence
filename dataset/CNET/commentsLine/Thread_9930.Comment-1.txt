i am having problems with dust in my computer.
i have my computer on for several hours a day, and i think that it is overheating, and when i took the case of my pc, i discovered that there was a lot of dust inside, especially on the fans.
does anybody know what i can do about the dust, or if there are any solutions?
if you do, please let me know.
thanks.
