I have a Mac and a PC at home, and I want to link the internet modem if not both computers, together using a wireless router. However, my spouse does banking on-line and is not comfortable with a wireless router. So, can one computer be wired and the other wireless? Or is there a way to switch between wired and wireless such that when she wants to do banking, there are no hotspots as it were?

Remember to update the firmware in the wireless router. They sit in the warehouse with outdated firmware.
