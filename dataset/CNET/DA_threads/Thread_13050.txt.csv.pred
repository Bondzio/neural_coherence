1.1.3	I have a Toshiba Laptop 1805 and it does the job, except I have to hook up a cd burner whenever I want to cut a cd.	St
1.1.4	I am set up wireless with a 5mb line from Charter Cable.	St
1.1.5	The Toshiba is getting old, had to reload it twice since xmas, but I like XP because this is easy to do.	St
1.1.6	Now for the problems: 1.	St
1.1.7	I am a former main-frame programmer, who is frustrated by PC's and all the choices you have to make.	St
1.1.8	2.	St
1.1.9	I kind of like to sit on my couch and multi-task while working on the internet.	St
1.1.10	3.	St
1.1.11	My grandson is coming up for a few months, and since he can't bring his PS/3, he wants to play that WOW game here.	St
1.1.12	QUESTION: Do I really need to get a desktop to satisfy both our needs?	St
1.1.13	And which machine would you suggest?	St
1.1.14	I talked to Dell because I used to have one, and like the onsite repair they offer.	St

1.2.1	doing on the PC.....any specific games ?	Ques

1.3.1	a laptop with P-3 that's about 5 yrs old, lacking all the bells/whistle that a modern one does.	St
1.3.2	OK. A modern laptop has built-in all the features you, not your grandson, currently use and some models even exceed them.	St
1.3.3	Gaming on a laptop is definitely possible but not for lower powered models.	St
1.3.4	Generally, a gaming machine requires fast graphics which in turn consume more power and runs hotter and drain batteries faster when not on AC power.	St
1.3.5	You could buy such a laptop for $1500-$2000 but you may be better off getting both a lower priced laptop for your use and a desktop for gaming.	Sug
1.3.6	Go to a Best Buy or Circuit City or CompUSA and check the selections.	St
1.3.7	Or get from Dell.	St
1.3.8	The major brands generally have good support, in spite of occasional lapses.	St
1.3.9	How about this: get a laptop now and when your grandson arrives, have him play his game to see if it's good enough; if not you can walk into the store and pick up a powerful enough desktop at a moment's notice.	Sug
1.3.10	Have fun shopping!	St
1.4.1	Grandson is 15 and he was playing some game I think was called WOW.	St

1.5.1	I would say get a portable computer a XPS system is not needed if you want to go Dell one of there inpiron systems would do nicely.	St
1.5.2	They tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive.	St
1.5.3	If all you Granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine.	St
1.5.4	Reason why I say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer.	St
1.6.1	Thanks for the response - it makes sense to me.	St
1.6.2	I will send him a copy, Janet	St
