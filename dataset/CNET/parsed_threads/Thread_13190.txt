<s> After working/burning CDs and DVDs for the last five years I've come to the conclusion that this medium is the most UNRELIABLE media the industry has ever adopted. </s>
<s> First is the un compatibility problem with various dvd players/recorders. </s>
<s> A home made dvd will not play on all dvd players. </s>
<s> Either will a dvd burned on a stand alone dvd recorder play on all makes and models of dvd players. </s>
<s> It's a compatibility nightmare! </s>
<s> Second is the delicate nature of the medium itself. </s>
<s> The outside layer is very prone to scratches and nicks. </s>
<s> One little scuff mark can render the medium completely unusable. </s>
<s> One literally must handle this medium with silk gloves and with more care than a vinyl LP record. </s>
<s> Third is the big question of longevity of the data on the disk itself, we all must admit that the jury is still out on this. </s>
<s> In the meantime we have heard various reports of a few years to 100 years. </s>
<s> Now we hear of cautions that this medium must be sheltered away from extreme light and in an environment of controlled humidity and temperature. </s>
<s> I advise my customers who request that their vhs, slides, or 8mm movies be transferred to DVD for preservation - that this is not the solution. </s>
<s> Yes, I will transfer to dvd only on their request and that they sign a release that the work is not guaranteed on a dvd format. </s>
<s> I've experienced that 30% or more of my customers have numerous problems with playing their dvd on their home machines. </s>
<s> I had one customer steaming mad, a dvd of her family home movies, it played great on her home machine. </s>
<s> But when she tried to play this same dvd at her daughters home (1500 miles away) the dvd played with sputs and spurts and then stopped only 2 minutes into the program. </s>
<s> You can imagine the disappointment! </s>
<s> Boy did I get an earful when she called me on the phone. </s>
<s> From this and many more bad experiences I have lost many future customers and all faith in the CD/DVD medium we have today. </s>

<s> That DVD players appeared on the market well before DVD recordable media? </s>
<s> Also, do you remember the format war of DVD-R and DVD+R? </s>
<s> And finally did you notice that some players list neither, one or the other or both? </s>
<s> In closing I note the + or - on the media and include a note that the player's media compatibility list must be checked. </s>
<s> I've had no issues that you speak of and since I put them in boxes or sleeves the scratches issues have been neglible. </s>
<s> Then again I pick them up from the edges as noted in the care and handling guides. </s>
<s> As to extreme light, this issue applies to vinyl LP, VHS tape and more so nothing new here. </s>
