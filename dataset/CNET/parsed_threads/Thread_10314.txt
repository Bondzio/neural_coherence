<s> ok, this will take a long time for i want to say as much as possible. </s>
<s> i have a linksys befsr41 router connected to a broadband modem, by ethernet. </s>
<s> there were two laptops and a ps3 connected to it, all working fine. </s>
<s> but my dad bought a new computer and messed up somthing in the back and now nothing works. </s>
<s> all computers connect to the router but the router cant connect to the internet, a red x is there. </s>
<s> the problem is that the new computer has internet if it is directly connected to the modem, or sometimes when connected to the router (i have no idea why sometimes it works on and off). </s>
<s> but no matter what, all other computers can not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> i dont know if this is involved, but my laptop can not connect to the modem directly. </s>
<s> and yes i have reset the modem and the router 3000 times, any help would be good, our family needs the internet. </s>
<s> What exactly do you mean with &quot;all computer can connect to the router&quot;. </s>
<s> How do you see that? </s>
<s> Where is that red x? </s>
<s> I've never seen a router with a red x, so that's unclear. </s>
<s> The thing to look for, I think: the encoding (WEP, WPA, WPA2) and the password. </s>
<s> Those must match between the router and the laptop/ps2. </s>
<s> If your father changed that, all existing devices won't work anymore. </s>
<s> The workaround will cost your father some 60 dollar: buy a new router and set it up exactly like you did setup the old one. </s>
<s> That should work, shouldn't it? </s>
