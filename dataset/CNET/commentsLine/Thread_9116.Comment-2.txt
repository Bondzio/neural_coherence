when you first started to use the drive, did you format it with disk utility or did you just plug it in and go about your way?
you may want to look at a couple of utility programs.
disk warrior would be my first choice.
dw will rebuild the indexes on your hard drive and could well get it to mount again.
that said, i believe it only works on disks that are mac formatted.
(just checked, it only works on &quot;mac&quot; disks) others to consider are drive genius, data rescue iii and file salvage.
i gather from the statement, &quot;can't afford to lose the contents&quot;, that you do not have a backup of this data.
the drive itself is probably still under warranty but that only covers replacement.
seagate will recover the data for you but be prepared to fork out many hundreds of dollars (insert currency of choice) for the service.
let us know about the format thing.
