thanks for your help.
both local usb printers show &quot;stopped&quot; even though i was only trying to print to one when this started.
restarting the document just seemed to put it back in the queue but it would eventually stop as before.
(also tried restarting computer.)
deleting both printers and trying to reinstall one doesn't work, as printer setup utility no longer sees any usb drivers.
