the network address of the home network is 192.168.20.96/28 .
nat router is 128.14.87.62. a) what is the range of the possible addresses for the host in the home network?
b) assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network.
c) suppose each host has two ongoing tcp connections, all to the host 128.119.40.86 at port 80. provide all the corresponding entries in the nat translation table.
(hint: some port numbers may be any valid port number) anyone can tell how to calculate the addresses??
?
