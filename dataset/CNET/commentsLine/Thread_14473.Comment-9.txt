omg apple should include the remote.
i mean you are already paying higher prices then for a normal pc with the same stats, and apple had to go to all the trouble as to remove a tiny remote.
just include it already.
its 20 bucks how much money does apple need.
i mean, i dont care as much about how much it is to add on, it could be 1 dollar for all i care.
the principal is that you have to buy it separately.
and why is it included with the imacs then.
well whatever, but yes the 400 dollar 4 gig a ram is nice.
850 had no chance of selling.
fyi amazon sells four gigs of memory for the macbook for 113 bucks
