<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4300 with 2 hard drives an 80 gig and a 40 gig. </s>
<s> All of a sudden I get the subject error message. </s>
<s> System lites up and I see the Dell screen then it beeps twice and posts the error message and F1 to continue, F2 to go to setup. </s>
<s> Tried both but keep coming back to same error. </s>
<s> I've reversed the drives (Master/Slave) and still get it. </s>
<s> I can't believe that both drives died at the same time. </s>
<s> When power is on with case open I can feel vibration in the drives as though they are spinning. </s>
<s> Cooling fans are running. </s>
<s> Checked power leads to drives with VOM and detect voltage present. </s>
<s> Where do I start CPU?/Motherboard?/ BIOS? </s>
<s> Any help appreciated. </s>
<s> In the Bios to see if the drives are properly seen. </s>
<s> Then a new 80 pin cable. </s>
<s> Then try the second IDE controller. </s>
<s> I suggest you reseat the HD cables several times and check results. </s>
<s> Try another HD cable(new?). </s>
<s> Try with only one HD installed, the other disconnected entirely but not removed. </s>
<s> make sure jumper reflect what that brand should be for solo HD. </s>
<s> If you had this system for sometime, maybe the bios(CMOS) battery is weak, replace. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> but the cable itself has 80 conductors. </s>
<s> [40 extra ground wires]. </s>
<s> Thanks this did it one at a time I installed the drives and discovered that the 15 month old 60gig hard drive is dead. </s>
<s> I repaired the installation of Win XP on the 40gig drive and system is back up and running. </s>
<s> Thanks to all for your help. </s>
