I recentley had the local I.T. wiz, install me a second hard drive of 160GB along with a DVD-RW drive and a couple of software packages (main one is called 'MySonic' DVD). I want to use this software on my new hard drive for my video's and slide shows, but don't know how to change it from drive 'C', to drive Archive 'F'? In Disk Management, it shows both drives...as follows..... Archive (F:)..PARTION..BASIC..NTFS..HEALTHY..149.05GB..148.94..99%FREE...NO WINXP (C:)..PARTITION..BASIC..NTFS..HEALTHY(system)..37.26GB..10.29GB..27%..NO.. Both drives seen to be marked as 'primary partition' I am sure it is a simple thing to do, but I admit to being a novice at this type of thing, so any help at all would be great, but please, keep it simple as poss, thanks a lot for your time guys. Malc. (p.s. Don't know where the smiley's come from)

Reversing the ( would get you a frown. Read the Cnet FAQ for more. Now, the drive the software is installed on does not matter as far as where it's files will be stored. By default, most programs install on the boot drive because that's where Windows is. XP does not insist on drive C: being the boot drive. Your new drive just occupies the next available letter when it was installed so, somewhere, you have a D: and an E: already. You can leave things alone and they should work fine. If they are not working, post what the problem is. You can change the drive letters very easily (with the exception of the boot drive) with XP. This is done through the control panel under administrative tools. I would refer giving details until you know exactly what needs to be changed. Only one drive can use the same letter except in esoteric configurations such as RAID but that's another issue. Hope this helps and feel free to post more details.

Most of us forget that the html coding here is crapped out so if you see an inadvertent smiley assume it is actually : ) or : &gt; : \ instead. OK.....on to the next problem. Are you saying that the software has already been installed and that you now want the END product to be sent/stored on the F: drive? If so, look in the settings/configurations of the program itself to direct it to a specific folder you create on the F: drive ahead of time (usually it will say something like DESTINATION or STORE LOCATION....with the C: \ in front of the default folder setting so you can create a new folder with the same name but change the drive to F: \ instead. The reason both drives are marked as Primary Partition is because when the drives were created by the IT, he didn't make the new one just an Extended Partition with a logical drive instead that Extended Partition. This way, you could always just install XP or another operating system on it and it would be ready to be a bootable drive....whereas Extended Partitions would have to be completely redone to be bootable.

I have conected my cam corder and that seems to have done what I was after, thank you once again. One prob I have is viewing video/slide show I have created back on the PC.(they play ok on a DVD player) One of two things come up..... 'Windows Media Player/Real player' cannot play the DVD because a compatable DVD decoder is not installed on your pc'... or... 'Does not recognise the format'.... This means I cannot edit or add to the disk... I have searched and searched...Windows seem not to support this software or anywhere else I can find except from the 'Sonic' site itself and they won't let me d/load as I have a free e-mail addy(although I do pay a subsciption to have hotmail plus) even if I pay the 8.98 fee(I am UK based). I can get the disk at extra cost through the the mail. I already have updated to OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 Host Contoller. Another prob that has appeared is... Since adding the Sonic 'MYDVD' software and the new DVD-RW Hardware, I can no longer d/load to disk my photo folders from the 'My Pictures' page, seems not to recognise either the D: or E: drives...no matter what drive I put the disk in (but it does let me upload/d-load music from either). When I try to copy to disk in the D: drive, it comes up with....'please insert disk into DVD D: drive', even though there IS a disk inserted already... When I try to copy to disk in DVD-RW drive E: it comes up with...'E:\ is not accessible, incorect function... Here's what comes up on 'My Computer' page.... Under 'Hard disk Drives'..... Win XP C: and Archive F: (new hard drive) .... Under 'Devises with removeable storage... '3 1/2'' Floppy A:'... 'DVD drive D:'...(this changes to Audio drive D: when music CD inserted) 'DVD-RW Drive E:'...(this changes to CD Drive E: when disk inserted and 'copy' ticked from the 'My Pictures' page... Guess it may be a 'settings' prob or a conflict between something...I have looked and looked all day so far, with no joy, just seem to be going around in circles... So if you guys have any ideas or can push me in the right direction, you would make me a very happy chappy. Once again thank you for your input and if you need any more info, please ask, I will look in later. Malc.
