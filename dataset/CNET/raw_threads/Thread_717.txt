6503	0	56184	669000	NR	orgs1	1/9/05 12:16 PM	1.10527296E12	Network Backup	I work (non-IT) for a company with several computers (98 to XP pro) and I dabble in PC repair on the side. They have asked me to setup a backup system for approx. 10 machines. About 20 computers exist on this network. What they would like me to do is backup these computers nightly to a single computer that would solely be used for this purpose. I know it's not the best or safest backup plan and I have expressed this to them. At a subsidiary in another city a tech has done this for them and they seem happy with it. I own 3 software backup programs that are not in use, so I would gladly sell them one ie..Norton Ghost 2003, Acronis True Image v8.0, and Stomp BackupMyPc. I have in the past cloned my own drive, but I have not done nightly incremental backups before. I want to do this for them, but I have no idea exactly how to do it. My questions....I know its probably a detailed procedure, but does anyone feel like walking me through this in simple terms or can anyone direct me to a site that describes this process in easy to understand language. Secondly, would one of my programs be the way to go or should I use Windows own automated backup (this is what was used in the aforementioned 'other' city). It seems to me that either way this should not be such a difficult task, but it certainly has me confused. I hope someone can help me. I really want to do this for them as I could win some brownie points with my employer. I've googled this and have found very little in the tutorial area and what I have found was incomplete or very difficult to comprehend. Most sites do not really recommend this plan as a great backup method, therefore offer little or no help. Also the tutorials/help files in the above programs seem quite vague and again some what incomplete for a novice. My boss may not want to backup 10 machines, I was guessing, however I am certain that he would like to backup at least one. I guess if I can figure out one machine, I can do ten. Again, if someone can help me, with possibly even a vague description of how to do this, I could probably figure the rest out.Any advice or direction will be greatly appreciated. You guys have never let me down in the past and I am grateful for that. Thanks in advance!!!!
