<s> Does XP allow for people who wish to use 1980's or early '90's monitors? </s>
<s> My monitor is &quot;Impression3 Plus&quot; Non Interlaced The display (& printout) is out of wack, for example a webpage can sprawl over 2 pages when it's supposed to be only one page. </s>
<s> I've been trialling this old spare monitor, since I'd been experiencing acute electrosensitivity with the Samsung Syncmaster 151s LCD. </s>
<s> I'm *definitely* experiencing less electrosensitivity with it than with the &quot;high-tech&quot; LCD. </s>
<s> With the latter, I'd sometimes wake up the next day with acute abdominal pains. </s>
<s> I suspect it's because I cannot adjust the Syncmaster to be dimmer than a certain point. </s>
<s> Anyone know whether there are any LCD manufacturers who *do* cater to photosensitivity by allowing the brightness to be turned very very very dim, the way dial knob CRTs are? </s>

<s> As to the printout, there is an interaction of display and printer drivers and even more the web browser may have a method to shrink the printout to one page. </s>

<s> http://www.worldofalternatives.com/harmonics/links/electrosensitivity.html Hmm, I guess so, but I can't comment on this since I don't know anyone that has complained to me about this. </s>

<s> Your choice, but early CRTs didn't cater to people much. </s>

<s> I'm still not sure how I can get my display to be OK. Must I be stuck between a choice of either suffering &quot;electrocution&quot; or else crazy display? </s>
<s> Re: the dimming filter, do you have any idea what those things cost, and where to obtain? </s>
<s> I think I saw them over at OfficeMax. </s>
<s> They seem to be mostly of the Polaroid polarizing filter type now. </s>
<s> Antiglare mostly. </s>
<s> These forums don't sell things, so costs vary globally and this is a global forum. </s>
<s> You'll have to shop where you shop? </s>
