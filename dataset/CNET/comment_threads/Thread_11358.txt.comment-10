Hi, I have intel 845 motherboard based system with 250 Gb SATA HDD having windows Xp Professional.
Now I would like to install a a new 1Tb SATA HDD in the system with windows 7 on it.
Some of the software installed in the system works only with Windows XP so I want to retain it whereas my kids want windows 7 on the PC as operating system.
Suggest how to install the OS on two different HDD.
The system is already running on Windows Xp with HDD of 250 gb and three partition c, d, e. Now I plant to install a new HDD with windows 7 and would like to have the option of choosing the OS.
I want to have 100Gb for installation and rest of the portion for saving files on my new 1 Tb HDD.
Is it possible to merge the d and e drives on my 250 Gb HDD after transferring the files to 1 TB HDD.
Please suggest the method of installation.
