You could do wireless networking for a really good solution.
What OS are your computers, do they have NIC's, if they do then you could make your own Crossover Cable: http://www.makeitsimple.com/how-to/dyi_crossover.htm and connect the two computers directly together, but if they are old then you might have trouble.
If you do decide to use Wireless networking then I can help you set up folder sharing and other things.
