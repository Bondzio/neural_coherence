1.1.1	I have a HP XL759 desktop and it became obvious to me that I needed more RAM .	St
1.1.2	When my computer boots it loads three programs .	St
1.1.3	After it boots , I checked the System status and noted that only about 40 % of the installed 256 MB memory was available ( i.e. , 60 % was being used by the start up programs ) ... .so I decided to double the memory .	St
1.1.4	I checked HP website for applicable RAM and then installed the recommendation of HP upto the max amount allowed by this PC ( 512 MB ) .	St
1.1.5	Once installed , I checked the System again upon booting up and the computer recognizes/sees the RAM ... .but it still says only about 40 % of the installed 512 MB RAM is available ... as if the computer can see the additional RAM but it is n't using it .	St
1.1.6	Any ideas on how to solve my problem ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks ...	Polite
1.2.1	The MEMORY ARTICLES at http : //www.aumha.org/articles.htm should help you understand how Windows uses memory .	St
1.2.2	Such memory , if not used by an application will eventually be used to cache hard disk data or some other dll .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Simply put , because you updated the ram , you can not then assume your system will show that much more available .	St
1.3.2	As Rob stated , the O/S will find a use for the extra ram you 've given it .	St
1.3.3	Whether that be for cacheing hard disk data or whatever .	St
1.3.4	Generally , the more ram you have the better , it may not show that in the % being used , but you may find a marked system performance increase because the O/S generally has to rely less on the pagefile or & quot ; virtual ram & quot ; on your hard disk .	St
1.3.5	Reading and writing to and from physical ram is drmatically faster than to and from the hard disk .	St
1.3.6	Simply put , the more ram you have the more the computer will use because if it goes to the physical ram looking for something and does n't find it there , it 'll look in the & quot ; virtual ram & quot ; on the hard disk , decreasing the time performance for that function .	St
1.3.7	The more that can be loaded into the physical ram the better .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the info .	St
