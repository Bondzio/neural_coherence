1.1.1	im in need of a laptop and i will need it for the everyday what not, but i will also be using it for dj'ing which needs speed.	St
1.1.2	so... should i go for the... Intel Pentium M Processor 730 (1.6GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 533MHz FSB) or Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor 538 (3.20GHz1, 1MB L2 Cache) http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2342&p=15 according to allot of research, i know its just gaming specs, but u can get an idea that these M cpu's dont suck in speed and even better than some P4's.	St
1.1.3	but this is one of the reasons of the thread, im confused on this chip.	St
1.2.1	The 64-bit wave is very much in plain sight now.	St
1.2.2	The changeover will leave thousands with a bad taste in their mouth as they mumble about paying top dollar for just a 32-bit machine.	St
1.2.3	I don't suggest the 3.2+ GHz P4 HT models since they are hot desktop replacements with short battery times.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Wnat chip would you suggest?	St
1.3.2	im in need of speed and battery is not a problem for me.	St
1.4.1	While at the office we are picking up Athlon 64 R3000 laptops, that may not be enough for you.	St
1.4.2	Keep shopping if you don't want to complain in just 2 to 3 months over the 64-bit issue.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I just contacted HP/Compaq support yesterday, and they said they were going to offer a bios update that will enable users with motherboards capable to upgrade to em64t processors to upgrade.	St
1.5.2	When this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit.	St
1.5.3	Unfortunately, i doubt compaq/Hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket.	St
1.5.4	But this is better than getting a new machine.	St
1.5.5	Quoted technician &quot;Yes, sure it will be released in future.	St
1.5.6	Research is being carried out to check it workability.	St
1.5.7	I will forward your messages to our Research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot; Roger	St
1.6.1	basically what that is saying is that if you have a Pentium 4 Sequence 5, they'll give you a Sequence 6 once the BIOS revision is done, but not a new chip in 2006 (as they will probably require new chipsets (intel's new chips (just released) can't run on any of their chipsets, except the 945 and 955) I would wiat i'd wait for the Intel Yonah to be completed (it's a dual core version of the Pentium M with 64-bit extensions) but it's probably not out until around July or later the Sequence 8 chips were just released (Sequence 8, Intel Pentium D 8xx, their dual core) not only would I suggest 64-bit (either AMD64 or EM64T) but i'd also suggest dual cored 64-bit (so you have two EM64T equipped Prescott's, or a pair of AMD64 equipped cores) so that you can run 64-bit applications, AND multi-threaded applications (both of these are going to be a reality soon)	St
