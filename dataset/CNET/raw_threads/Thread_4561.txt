When I picked it up the seller asked my OS and when I told him, &quot;Windows XP Professional&quot; he recommended that before installing the board I change a setting in Device Manager, commenting that if he himself had done so before installing the board it would have saved him a lot of trouble. I can no longer contact him but what I can recall is this: The setting that should be changed is PCI to IDE device. He said I should uninstall the driver and then update it, selecting &quot;standard driver&quot; from a list. I asked what part of Device Manager to look at and he said it would be in System Devices. Now that I am ready to install the board I have opened Device Manager and System Devices but cannot see &quot;PCI to IDE.&quot; I would appreciate any advice about this because I have no idea what he was talking about.
