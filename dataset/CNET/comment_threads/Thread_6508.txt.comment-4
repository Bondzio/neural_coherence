Sorry I wasn't clear.
The RAM and Motherboard I linked are the ones I'm using in my current system.
I'm not looking at any particular sticks of RAM right now, as I don't know what I *can* look for.
Current RAM (Not over-clocked): Brand - G.SKILL Model - F3-12800CL7D-4GBHZ Type - 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM Capacity - 4GB (2 x 2GB) Speed - DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Cas Latency - 7 Timing - 7-7-7-18 Voltage - 1.9V Heat Spreader - Yes As for my Motherboard: Memory-wise: Number of Memory Slots - 4?240pin Memory Standard - DDR3 1600 Maximum Memory Supported - 8GB Channel Supported - Dual Channel It's easy enough to find matching type, speeds and capacities.
BUT I'm not sure about the importance of CAS Latency, Timing, or Voltage.
