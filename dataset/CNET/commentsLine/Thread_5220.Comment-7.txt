may i ask if anyone has specific recommendations about monitors in terms of color rendition and definition?
i can walk into a store and visually compare say flat screen tvs of various technologies, sizes and specs, but i cannot do the same with monitors since most are sold only by mail order, such as dell.
that's why i am asking if anyone has experience based recommendations... thanks.
