<s> Hello, I just replaced a customer's faulty cable to bring back their CD-RW and DVDROM Drive. </s>
<s> The DVD ROM drive functionality is in question. </s>
<s> Windows sees this as a CD-ROM drive. </s>
<s> Nowhere have I run into any DVD ROM driver info for this seemingly generic device. </s>
<s> I tried the AIDA and Sandra utilities, and both cannot ID the manufacturer, and every description of the device is simply &quot;DVDROM 1 0x&quot;. </s>
<s> Wondering if anyone has encountered the same situation and can lend any expertise as to this drive's true identity. </s>
<s> Happy Weekend Jay </s>
<s> Windows 98 didn't know about DVDROM drives and would report it as a CDROM except in some well installed instances. </s>
<s> For example, very few know how to install this old OS anymore. </s>
<s> 99% of the time, the motherboard drivers don't get installed. </s>
<s> Beyond that, it's just a very old OS that didn't know about such a drive. </s>
<s> If it plays a DVD with the DVD software, then it's done. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thank you; major lesson learned here. </s>
<s> Spent a lot of $$ time looking at Taiwainese web sites and questionable drivers (which I wisely never downloaded). </s>
