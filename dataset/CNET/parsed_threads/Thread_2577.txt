<s> alright so here it goes windows xp nvidia gforce 5950 amd 64 asus motherboard comp starts up showing asus mb screen sometimes but then goes blank, no beeps, but for the most part 3/4 of the time it starts with a blank screen. </s>
<s> fans are running, everythings on. </s>
<s> ive tried unplugging, re-instering cards, blown out the dust, bought a new even better power supply, spent 3 hours on google tryin to find a solution, nothins worked so far. </s>
<s> but it may help to know that my computer does this everytime i leave it off for more than a couple weeks, i have no idea why but i custom built it myself and ive had it for 3 years. </s>
<s> usually ill just blow it out, unplug and replug stuff, last time it happened i bought a new power supply and it worked, but nothings working this time, any ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Knoppix is a great introductory tool to linux and allows the user more control over his system. </s>
<s> im pretty sure its a hardware issue, but ill give it a try...i have a knoppix cd somewhere but i gotta find it, meanwhile keep posting suggestions. </s>
<s> personally i think there might be something up with the motherboard, since its not the power supply and the videocard is obviously working because occasionally the asus screen comes up, but possibly a faulty compacitor? </s>
<s> The hard disk shows up. </s>
<s> I read your post and it seems like the hard disk contents or boot has vanished. </s>

<s> this weird thing is, its happened to me atleast 4 times before. </s>
<s> ill leave it off for more than 2 weeks or so, usually when i go on vacation during christmas and summer, ill come back and ill get this black screen startup stuff. </s>
<s> usually i just mess around and do the stuff i said and she'd fix herself and start workin again. </s>
<s> only when i leave her off for a long period of time does it happen, and the same thing situation every time, the only difference is that this time nothings working...and i cant see how leaving a computer off could totally fry an OS </s>
<s> Type BAD CAPS in google.com to find what to look for. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yeah i blew a compacitor, ill post once i get a new board and start her back up </s>
<s> still isnt workin, i bought a new asus motherboard and hooked everything up, comps still doin the same thing. </s>
<s> black screen on startup with an occasional asus screen as soon as the monitor comes on but thats about it. </s>
<s> im starting to think it might be my 550 dollar videocard.... </s>
<s> The old video card works. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Most systems will be fitted with just big enough supplies. </s>
<s> Then people add drives, power hungry cards and things like this happen. </s>
<s> The power supply should be north of 400 Watts but I can't tell since the list of what's in the PC is rather short. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its a 550 watt antec, only about a year old, i bought it last summer to fix the same problem im havin now. </s>
<s> the power supply i bought yesterday and tried was a 650 watt thermaltake, but i still had the same problem when i hooked it up </s>
<s> I have this piece of cardboard which I put just the basic parts on such as motherboard, PSU, video card, 1 stick RAM, CPU/HSF and not much else to see if it beeps an behaves. </s>
<s> If not I downsize and try other parts. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Why cardboard? </s>
<s> Sometimes it's a case mounting or short issue. </s>
<s> alright so here it goes i moved my videocard into my friends comp and to my surprise it worked fine. </s>
<s> i put it back into my comp and finally took an old monitor and hooked it up to my comp, and i finally got it to work, apparently somehow it was my damn monitor the entire time..... but then i get to the whole &quot;windows did not shut down properly&quot; screen so i choose &quot;startwindows normally,&quot; the screen goes black and the comp restarts and the whole thing starts over again... so i decided id rather just reformat the entire thing then waste anymore time trying to fix it, i went into the bios and changed the primary boot device to my cd rom so i could put in the windows disk when i restarted. </s>
<s> i checked around the bios a little more and changed the &quot;primary video device&quot; from pci to agp and im pretty sure i also changed the &quot;aperture size&quot; from 128 to 256. i dont know why i did this but i did....so i restarted and now i dont have a picture at all, monitor light doesnt even turn green and i checked inside the case and my video card fans arent even on now, so i guess im back where i started, with a real problem this time </s>
<s> put back in the old motherboard with the leaking compacitor, started her up and she worked fine, turns out i guess it was the monitor the hole time.....i still dont believe it but i hooked it up to another comp and it did the same exact thing. </s>
<s> eventually im gonna need a new motherboard lol, thanks for all the help </s>
