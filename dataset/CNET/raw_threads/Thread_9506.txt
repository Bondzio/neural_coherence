Is there any way to hook up both a wireless router and his computer to the cable modem seperately? I'd hate to have to get a whole seperate cable hookup.

Some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't. You'll just have to investigate the modems available to you. If a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the USB port, and then connect a router using the Ethernet port for the other PCs. I think I'd have a heart to heart with my brother.

I had a friend some time back with a similar issue and eventually that is what happened, separate hook ups and different service providers, what a nightmare that was!
