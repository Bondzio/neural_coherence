I have some old Travan Sony tapes QTR-1, which hold 400MB uncompressed. I don't have a Tape drive anymore but wonder if its worth keeping them or disposing of them. I would like to get hold of a Tape drive and software that will work with Windows XP sp3 to utilise these tapes for Back-up etc. Can someone help please. Regards from the UK, David

You'd be far better off with CDs and or DVDs for data backup than reverting to low-capacity, high-cost tapes and hard-to-find tape drives. VAPCMD
