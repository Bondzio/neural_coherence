The line was already present, but I had to strip the cable, put on the connectors, crimp it and put on a terminating RJ-45 jack. After some trials and tribulations I finally got it working...at least I thought so. I have been able to connect my laptop and some other devices successful to this new line. My laptop is able to register with my router, get an IP address and connect to the internet and LAN. I recently got an XBOX360 for Christmas and set it up on my network on a different line with no problem. The XBOX was able to register and IP address, connect to internet (XBOX Live). Then I moved the XBOX to the line I created and the network status showed &quot;DISCONNECTED&quot;. I tried restarting the router and several other things (other router ports, different cables..) I am able to connect the XBOX on other physical lines, but not this one. This makes me believe the connectors I put in our bad, but why would some devices not work? Devices that have worked: 2 Dell laptops, 6.

Widely documented but as a test, tell me what pairs to what pins you used. Also, I test these setups for bad wiring by running my 100' cable from here to there. If that works I know it's the wiring. bob

I did the research on the EIA/TIA-568-A/B standard and followed what my home wiring contractors did (presumably EIA/TIA-568-A). However, it appears the contractors may have created their own standard. Here is what I used following the existing connectors: pin1: green/white pin2: green pin3: blue/white pin4: blue pin5: orange/white pin6: orange pin7: brown/white pin8: brown It appears pins 3 and 5 are reversed from the EIA/TIA-568-A standard. I'll make a new connector and see what happens. Thanks for the suggestion.

The problem is while it's electrically correct the incorrect pairs result in odd issues such as slow downloads, fast uploads and the issues you noted. Once the wiring is sorted, there are issues with XP and limited connectivity but with the wiring issue let's sort the hardware issue first. Bob
