<s> if you read my other post my pc is messed up but the hard drive is perfectly fine. </s>
<s> Now there are some very important files on there and i was wondering that if i were to put that hard drive in my dad's pc, what will happened? </s>
<s> his pc has XP and XP is also on my hard drive. </s>
<s> i was wondering if there is a way i can just get the files out of there? </s>
<s> because if i can just get the files i can then move them to my dad's hard drive and erase what on my hard drive and then add it as more storage to another pc </s>
<s> Done it myself. </s>
<s> Just make sure your HD is set for slave. </s>
<s> XP will see it as just another drive. </s>
<s> Copy what you wish, then do what you want. </s>
<s> Your logic is correct. </s>
<s> Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>
<s> good thing for me. </s>
<s> so all i need to do is set it up as a slave and then i will not have any other files? </s>
<s> One thing though. </s>
<s> On my PC that got messed up i had accounts with password. </s>
<s> Someone could not see someones else accounts(like thier desktop, documents, folders) will i be able to see them after setting it up as a slave? </s>
<s> but I've never looked for that type of stuff. </s>
<s> Give it a shot, it'll either work or it won't. </s>
