<s> So, i am ready to pick up a semi-decent gaming PC. </s>
<s> I'm afraid my tech skills have diminished quite a bit over the last few years. </s>
<s> Never had the time to keep up with the exploding tech. </s>
<s> Deciding between two. </s>
<s> AMD Phenom II X6 1055T 2.8GHz Processor 64 bit Six-Core 8GB AMD Radeon HD 6670 1GB Intel Core i5-2320 3.0GHz Processor 64 bit Quad-Core 8GB AMD Radeon HD 6770 1GB I'm leaning toward the second one, I believe i can actually upgrade RAM on this one, but I'm confused on the &quot;core&quot; amount. </s>
<s> Four vs. Six? </s>
<s> Meaningful? </s>
<s> Necessary? </s>
<s> Any help or thoughts would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I think your leaning in the proper direction. </s>
<s> Will there be a dramatic difference between the two?........doubtful. </s>
<s> Well, do you want 4 cores? </s>
<s> or 6... Six is better of course =D </s>
<s> We are mostly developers and not to upset the AMD folk, the i5 you listed is very very nice. </s>
<s> Go look at tomshardware CPU charts to see. </s>
