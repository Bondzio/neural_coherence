<s> &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; Your OS may have a rollback feature, but you neglected this tip so we have to fill in the blank spots first before which method can be used. </s>
<s> You may also want to try rebooting the computer and see if it clears up as well as look for any &quot;Safe Mode&quot; on the screen. </s>

<s> What does (or did) the screen look like at various phases during startup? </s>
<s> When you first turn it on, there should be some messages during the POST (Power on Self Test) process related to hardware configuration. </s>
<s> Does this look normal? </s>
<s> If not, you may have a hardware defect (monitor or video display card). </s>
<s> If this looks ok but the smaller screen only appears when the desktop appears, something may have happened to a setting or maybe a driver did not load properly. </s>
<s> You can try doing a right click on an empty area of the desktop and check the desktop properties. </s>
<s> You should be able to find the screen resolution, # of colors displayed and the refresh rate which is the number of times per second that rescan of the screen is done by the CRT as directed by hardware and software. </s>
<s> It would help if you knew what these should be. </s>
<s> Another adjustment might be the monitor controls themselves. </s>
<s> They can adjust the vertical and horizonal size and position of the desktop screen. </s>
<s> These might have been accidently reset. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
