Looking to get a new set up and looking at the large price difference. Reading reports and such make me re think the Athlon. Which is better for gaming, videos, MP3's and such. AMD Athlon 64 or Intel Pentium D Processor. I would like to get the most bang for the buck. The problems I have seen in the past is incompatability with software and the AMD.

But that's top end. I have a single core AMD Athlon 64 and it runs quieter and uses less power than Intel. A great little chip. http://reviews.cnet.com/Desktops/2001-3118_7-0.html?tag=ont.desk

I am about to make this decission between AMD and Intel and would appreciate any input. With the new dual core 975X it is tempting to go with Pentium but the benchmarking is really confusing and this is a new addition from Intel - hasn't been around enough for me to find much from anyone who has seen it in action. Suggestions?(Looking to add a new Windows PC that can use Vista later - do picture and film work but not full length and don't do gaming). Thanks

Now I have to decide between the Hp or Gateway variations. Not this computer but the next I will probably build it. All tests I saw had the AMD x2's dominating the Intel D's. srieth

Even Intel has thrown that out because AMD CPU's outperform them while running at much lower speeds. Almost all new Intels at this time are desperate moves on their part as gap fillers until they can get their new lower power [heat] lower clock speed CPU's out, and end up with improved performance from new architecture.

Take a intal and AMD of the same cofiguration and I have found that the Intel is the most expensive by 200 - 300 dollars. Also checking out Cnets tests and a few other sites tests it is a decisive AMD love fest. I will admit that I have not liked Atholons up until this point but this should change that additude. srieth

Intel's advertised speed is always higher than AMD, because it uses a technique called Quad Data Rate, which transfers 4 data per clock cycle. Let's say the Intel cpu is said to be 3.2GHz, it's real clock is actually only 800MHz, because 3200/4=800. AMD uses a technique called Double Data Rate, it transfers 2 data per clock. Therefore, lets say u have an AMD with 2.2GHz, the true clock is 2200/2, which equals to 1.1GHz. Thus AMD is actually faster than Intel. It may not make sense to you now, but if you look at the link on the bottom, and do some other research, you will see what I am talking about. You may not understand what I am saying now, because I am bad at explaining things, but you will after some googling. http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/133 Cheers

In order for a system to be optimized, the CPU's FSB must match half the DDR frequency. AMD with 400MHz FSB + dual channel DDR400 = optimized Intel with 800MHz FSB + dual channel DDR800 = optimized http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/133
