you didn't mention why the hd wasn't bootable as in is really screwed-up or simply a h/w and/or os fault.
if the orginal hd can be mounted and you have access to another hd, install the replacment hd as drive c and the old one as drive d, or as the new master/slave setup.
i assume you know how to do that.
the new hd boots up and if the old hd is at least mountable, you can transfer data.
i exclude any h/w fault or virus/malware at work here.
if you find the data is hosed, then i have no cure even if old hd mounts.
if the data is small amounts, try booting with a startup floppy and see if even you can access the old drive c and possibly the data.
you can try a s/w hd repair, check at  and find &quot;spinrite&quot; pgm.
provided no hard fault is present.
also, similar pgms.
like norton &quot;disk doctor&quot;, etc.
may help.
try the sys command.
just as sys c: which will reload the ms bootable command back to the drive, if capable.
the startup floppy or os cd.
if xp, see if the &quot;repair&quot; hd works, but try that if the above does apply.
later, for using the computer to the scout troop, you can buy a &quot;swappable&quot; hd kit.
you can then physically remove drives as in &quot;swap&quot; with computer off.
keep your important hd for your own needs when done, take it out and replace it with spare hd that the scouts can call thier own.
hope all this helps -----willy
