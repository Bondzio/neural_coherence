I have the belkin 802.11g wireless router downstairs and want to set up my xbox live upstairs in my room. Would the best way to do this be to use a wireless bridge? Would it have to be a Belkin? I heard that I can use another router as a bridge. Let me know. I am new to all of this. Thanks.

You can get a b/g Wireless pc card from netgear and they work together. As for the router as a bridge i dont know if that will work i would get some thing like this... http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=0&pid=241 i think that sould work. Just check to see if its Xbox Live rated make sure ur wireless router is too.
