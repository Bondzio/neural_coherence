<s> My cat walked across my laptop (before i could stop her) now none of my computer keys work. </s>
<s> I switched my computer off and restarted it, but I can't even type my password in. </s>
<s> Help....what do I do?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> You probably have a &quot;stuck/jammed&quot; key on the kybd.. With no power present, run your fingers across the keys back and forth on all keys several times, hopefully this will unjam the stuck one. </s>
<s> Again, with no power, turn laptop over and rap the back side a few times to see if anything falls out or unjams. </s>
<s> Now, retry to boot and check results. </s>
<s> If this doesn't work, then full access to dissemble the laptop maybe required, post back details on what your laptop is. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
