as i posted in a later thread, i just bought a planar pl1700 17&quot; from cdw.
i got a special price through my son-in-law's company but they are &lt;$300 and have a 3 year 2 day replacement warranty.
bob is right about the 3 year life expectancy, but my son-in-law has one that is 4 years old and still going; sorry i can't remember what brand though.
