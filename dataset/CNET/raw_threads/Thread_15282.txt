I have recently purcahsed a Epson Picture Mate - personal photo lab- and have, as yet, not even been able to set it up. I am not using it in connection with a pc just connected to a Fujifilm Finepix digital camera. having put in correctly the printer cartridge and turned i on i get only so far before i get an error message like this: 'a printer error has occurred. See your printer's documentation. fatal code: 0x80' I cannot find an answer to this problem anywhere, can anyone please help as Epson have thus far proved uncontactable!?
