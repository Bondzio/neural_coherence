I've chatted with HP support and they suggested I buy a new printer.
It's an HP 1315v all in one and we're running XP.
It will print a full page on 20 lb paper but will only print two inches of the same image (with PSP) on 61 lb matte photo paper.
I've tried all the settings and the printer will pick up the matte paper, and it just stops printing but won't eject the paper itself, I have to push the on button for it to eject the paper.
I've never had this problem before and it's been a really good printer.
I blame the fact that I just spent $$ on new cartridges.
Any ideas?
