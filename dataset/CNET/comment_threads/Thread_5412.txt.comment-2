Microsoft's XP CDs and many others don't have the drivers.
Here's what I do when I need to save an owner's files.
I boot up one of our collection of LiveCD's that have Linux on them (you don't need to know Linux!)
and I can look at the files and then copy then off to some USB hard disk or over to our network (usually via ethernet).
Getting that XP working may or may not be possible.
Why?
Are the laptop drivers available on acer.com?
