I have a sony vio that have blutooth stack for windows by Toshiba.
I connect thru it to GPS dongle after connecting to the device ,when I click on detail button I see the MAC address of device, also I can type in Application-path dialog box a file to be run automatically after connecting to dongle.
does anybody know in which file the infornmatin of detail window (MAC address and application path) are saved?
