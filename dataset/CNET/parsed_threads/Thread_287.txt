<s> I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but I bet that my MBP will come back with something wrong. </s>
<s> If Apple moves to replaced it like they had suggested to me (I hope), I would probably get a Santa Rosa machine. </s>
<s> I doubt that they could get me the exact same one I had, since the 2.16Ghz models are no longer produced. </s>
<s> Their store site does not list any refurbished ones either, thought that doesn't mean anything... </s>
<s> I wouldn't want a refurb though. </s>
<s> The Mac is still relatively new... </s>
<s> I'm wondering if they would swap it with the low end 2.2Ghz model, which really isn't too different, or if they would let me go for the 2.4Ghz model. </s>
<s> The low end one has half of the graphics memory, a somewhat slower clock speed, and wouldn't give me any performance boosts that I could actually see. </s>
<s> Coming from a 2.16Ghz model, would a 2.4Ghz (or a 2.6?) </s>
<s> show any increased performance? </s>
<s> I mean, I'd have a new Nvidia card with double the memory that was on my ATI card, and I'd have a boost of at least 240Mhz. </s>
<s> Plus, the battery life is supposed to be very good with those LED displays. </s>
<s> I hope they let me get a good one that works so I don't have to deal with any more problems... </s>
<s> I've already lost a great deal of time because of all this. </s>
<s> Not to mention I broke a router in the process and had to get another one... </s>
<s> I'll be happy with at least 2.4Ghz and a 250GB HD. </s>
<s> 2GB of RAM is fine for me. </s>
<s> Even though the 2.2Ghz model replaced mine, I really could use a little extra power. </s>
<s> The 2.4Ghz model seems to represent the Santa Rosa line anyway, does it not? </s>
<s> They'll be doing your work and as we all know they tend to grease the squeaky wheels. </s>
<s> aren't always customer friendly. </s>
<s> I asked one Genius a similar question one time. </s>
<s> He gave me what seemed to be a dirty look and said that would never happen. </s>
<s> At least this time they acknowledged that it would be replaced if it isn't fixed this time. </s>
<s> They're shipping it to the depot, so they won't see the repairs until it comes back. </s>
<s> I hope it comes back before next Friday... Thing is, I'm trying not to push my luck here. </s>
<s> I was assured that it would be completely fixed when it comes back, and I intend to hold them to that promise, though a new Mac would be kind of nice. </s>
<s> They have to look at the AirPort card, the Ethernet hardware, and I hope they look at the board again... Plus, the casing is still messed up and the antennae that runs through the top of the laptop may have had issues too. </s>
<s> A little more than greasing I'm afraid. </s>
<s> A non qualified person opened it up. </s>
<s> I've seen botch jobs but not from the depot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This one is interesting, though I'm pretty sure that his situation was far worse than mine . </s>
<s> Here's the story: http://mybiggestcomplaint.com/apple-refusing-to-fix-my-macbook-pro/99/ and the other half: http://notquiteleet.com/2007/08/06/update-my-bent-macbook-pro-resolved/ That guy's Mac saw its fair share of botched jobs. </s>
<s> My Mac has come back twice now without being fully repaired, but it hasn't gotten too bad yet. </s>
<s> I mean the first two times, I explained to them all of my issues and I told them what I wanted fixed. </s>
<s> So far they've done a bang up job... </s>
<s> I really hope that they just swap it out when it returns, supposing it doesn't work right, because that guy's escapade doesn't sound too good. </s>
<s> Thankfully, the two Geniuses that helped me out sounded like they got most of it down, but... </s>
<s> I read the sheet with the scheduled repairs on it and I don't think they got them all down like they said. </s>
<s> I typed up every single thing I could find and had problems with just for them, but I suppose three pages of problems and complaints is too much for them. </s>
<s> They said they got them all, but I would disagree if that paper is correct. </s>
<s> That's what happened the first time... the guy didn't write one of the things down. </s>
<s> I noticed that before I left and asked him about it. </s>
<s> Said they had it and would check it out. </s>
<s> But they didn't. </s>
<s> Here it is happening again... Well, I look forward to my Santa Rosa machine, if I end up getting one. </s>
<s> My initial question remains: do the new Santa Rosa machines have any substantial advantages over their predecessors? </s>
<s> I guess I'll find out, but I'd like to know ahead of time. </s>
<s> -BMF </s>
<s> three pages of whatever &quot;is&quot; too much for them... </s>
<s> I miss my Mac now, with all of its nifty editing features. </s>
<s> At least FireFox has spell check. </s>
