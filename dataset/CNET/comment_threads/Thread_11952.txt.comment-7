Hi JM, Again, Thank you!
I know that computing is still a learning experience, and for this user a day-to-day learning experience.
No matter, when buying any peripheral for the computer including the scanner I know that I need to expect the least and then what I do manage to get won't be so disappointing.
I will most likely be calling on you again, time-to-time for advice.
I really appreciate all that you've done to help me along the way.
Have a great day!
:)
