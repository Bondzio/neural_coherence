asking others to id the proper m/b / cpu / chipset for you is like asking which is better .. ford or chevy.
i prefer intel chips and boards..dual memory 533mb min/ 533 or 800 fbs/ 2.4 or 3.0 cpu depending on system use.
amds' in some cases are a better choice.
i have found using a slower cpu to a fast m/b the amds' will smoke an intel.
i just don't like the small footprint amd presents for heat dissipation.
some good reading   good luck on your build bill .
