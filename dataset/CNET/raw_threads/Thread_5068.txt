It's a common selling point, but a little investigation will reveal the truth. Because of the bandwidth involved, a great picture can be received, and the leftover is available for internet. But I digress. Get the tuner card. A good one can be had for under a hundred bucks. Don't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17&quot; monitor, it's just not worth it. Visit the better internet selling sites, shop around. I like Buy.com and newegg.com. There are others in abundance. Do a Google search on tuner cards.

Does everything I need in both XP and Mandrake. Good image and comes with a remote. Selling now at Newegg for $45US with .99 shipping. If I were building a high-end PVR, I might go to a more expensive unit, but for everyday, this one is good. chuck
