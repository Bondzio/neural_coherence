<s> Notice that it differs from what you are doing? </s>
<s> It maybe a goner, but try: 1) remove from case and install into desktop system(may need adapter) 2) try another USB enclosure None of these work, then its done in. </s>
<s> The HD has crashed, you need a recovery service if you deem the data that priceless. </s>
<s> You can try what the link Robert offered as well. </s>
<s> But, you description is good. </s>
<s> Next time get you hands on Velcro fasteners/strips, stick to HD case and desk area to prevent future mishaps. </s>
