The only area you'll need to &quot;open&quot; up TCP 3389 is your router.
You do not need to &quot;open&quot; anything on your server UNLESS you have a 3rd party firewall software installed on your server.
And for the router part, depending on the brand and model of your router, it should be in area that said &quot;Port Forwarding&quot;, &quot;Pinhole&quot;, &quot;Services&quot;...etc.
For business class firewall, you'll have to add the services and define the rules.
check the firewall maker web site support section on how to setup port forward.
To connect from the internet, you'll need to know your public IP address as well (www.dslreports.com/whois) Open this web site from you local network and you'll see your public IP address.
