you mention &quot;generic&quot; and that what can happen, especially on a loaded-up system.
at least 400w is better than 300w whcih many a home build system case comes supplied with, so at least you started out decent.
the problem with a blown p/s unit is that it *could* cause other problem(s).
so don't discount it should after replacing the p/s unit flaky problem(s) may appear.
the better p/s units are enermax or antec(sp) or those supplied by pcpowerandcooling(dang good).
it not surprising that 500w+ units are now available and even if generic is better than 400w unless name brand.
good luck -----willy
