Provided the restore feature of XP or Vista was turned ON, you can use a &quot;restore point&quot; to back a day or two, select *one* from the list.
Under XP: goto start-&gt;pgms-&gt;accessories-&gt;system tools-&gt;system restore-&gt;follow prompts.
Now pick a date that makes sense, like a day before the problem occurred.
If Vista very similar.
Google for restore point to understand this feature.
Don't use a resotre disk or recovery disk to reload the system.
I hope I made this clear.
good luck -----Willy
