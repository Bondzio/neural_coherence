I know there are strict limitations regarding the type of card possible. Any help would be appreciated on what cards I can and can't have. PS: It's for a game.

It has a 270w psu...that's bad. It might have a spare pci slot but: Any card to fit that slot might not be much better than your integrated graphics. That machine was not designed to game.

Build a new system Buy as best of a video card you can, good framerates come from good video cards. I recommend you shell out the money for 1 or 2 Radeon HD 4870X2's and a xfire motherboard. Newegg has them for $500 each I think. If you have the cash C2Q, if you don't have the cash C2D. If the Graphics card left you broke, AthlonX2, or PhenomX3. RAM, 3 gigs with 32bit OS or 4 gigs with 64bit OS. DDR3 if your using intel. the lowest latency/fastest clock DDR2 if your using AMD. PSU something large. 1200 if your using dual Radeon HD 4870X2's Hard Drive. RPM matters more than Capacity. SSD's if you can afford it.
