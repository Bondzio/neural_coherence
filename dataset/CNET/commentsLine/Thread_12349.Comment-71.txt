i have the g 108 wireless router and desktop adapters...and i think you should go for the 108 mpbs, i think you will need it..i have 3 computers and sometimes the one at the far end of the house can get a weak signal, but then if it were moved closer to the door it would probably have a better signal...this doesnt happen all the time, just occasionally, but still i would suggest the 108mbps...by the way, mine is a dlink..g108...
