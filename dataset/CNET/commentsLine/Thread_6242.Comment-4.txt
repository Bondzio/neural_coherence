you will only have to install av software on the windows side of the mac.
when you are using windows you will see some slow down of the system but it should not be too great.
the mac side &quot;should&quot; be unaffected.
you can just turn off windows when you are not using it.
the web site &quot;should&quot; still be accessible to those who are not using ie 7. it would be silly to bar the site from anyone who is not using ie 7. the corporation i work for is not going to ie 7 for a long time, primarily because it is not very good.
