i am trying to upgrage my ram and video card on my hp dv6500.
how do i find out what is compatable with my computer so i don't buy something that won't fit?
buy the way it has the amd athlon 64x2 duel core tk-55 1.80 ghz processor, and 959 mb ram.
the video card is the basic nvidea graphics card that comes with the entertainment pc's but i want a much better one for hd movies and gaming.
