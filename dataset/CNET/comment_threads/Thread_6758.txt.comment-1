Hey there.
I`m trying to connect my mobile phone to my pc using a usb cable designed for the job.
The set up for the cable and software says that it should be a USB connection, but when it looks for the phone, it only looks at COM ports 1 and 2 (which I believe are the serial ports).
How can I give my USB port a COM number?
Is it even possible?
I`m using Windows XP Pro.
Thanks in advance
