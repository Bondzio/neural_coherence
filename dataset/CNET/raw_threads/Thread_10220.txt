SO sticking any psu will fry your computer. Google pc power and cooling and check for the psu that matches your model. The Psus are expensive. Dells always offer limited upgradeability and bad technical support. Roger

At first I thought the upgraded power supply I installed in one of my Dell systems was bad, especially considering the dramatic way it smoked when I turned the system on, I actually saw **fire through the vents**! Good thing I decided to check the color codes on the connectors and verify the pinout on another Dell system by using a voltmeter before I installed and fried a second supply.&quot; I recommend replacing the power supply AND motherboard with industry-standard components. Everything else should carry over. Heck, get a nice AMD Athlon 64 CPU to replace your power-guzzling P4 while you're at it. I like ASUS for motherboards and Seasonic for power supplies. Be sure to tell Dell what you did.

At first they would fail to start reliably, and eventually not at all. At first the Dell tech said I motherboard, but after replacing the MB and memory with no sucess, he traded out a PS and voila ... it worked! With another computer beginning to act up the rep ordered two PS's and those were fixed. When the other two started acting up, I called Dell but was told they couldn't replace parts with intermitent problems. No problem ... I called back and said &quot;they're dead&quot; and the PS's were shipped. BTW, pretty easy to replace .... about a 5 minute job once you know the one screw to remove and how to get the processor air funnel out of the way.

You have a new power supply that is better than the original. Probably cost you $150 (plus shipping) for the older models. But you factor in a mobo and a PSU to replace them, you are gonna fork over more dough anyway.

Well I went to all sorts of sites & couldn't find a replacement. It seems like it is either out of manufacturing or the manufactures make them so you can't get replacements. Well, anyway, I couldn't locate a 300watt one that would fit my system, so I went to a computer repair store close to me. I purchased a 350watt, instead of a 300watt. Installed it & it works great, so far. It cost me a bundle, but hey, its the only joy I get here. 1st time I've ever replaced a power supply & I'm proud of myself. When you find a store, take your old supply with you & make sure the new one is same size, hole alignment matches, etc. Also make sure all the cables match your cables on the old supply. I even got a supply that has more power cables then my old one. It leaves me room for expansion.

When I bought my Dell desktop 2 1/2 years ago, my husband insisted I get the extended warranty, which I did. I had the same symptoms of an imminent power supply failure - harder to start, erratic start, and no start. When the problem of starting began, I called Dell and they sent out a technician in less than 24 hours and of course, it worked perfectly, BUT the technician said he thought it was a power supply failure evolving and he was right. When I called Dell and told them of the previous visit, there was no taking my word for it, and my husband and I went through the lengthy talk-through on removing the case, etc. and finally, the person on the other end said, &quot;yes, it's a power supply failure&quot; and within 24 hours, it was fixed, in house. Not being savvy with the inner workings, did it cost me more to have the power supply replaced this way, or for an ignoramus, was this the best bet? In any event, I have to say that in my experience, Dell did a good job in handling the situation, or maybe I just got lucky with the technician in this area. I have a Gateway notebook (bought based on my previous positive experience with them) and I usually go through 3 or 4 phone calls until I get someone who actually sounds like they know what they're talking about and then take their advice - however, in order to have something less than minor taken care of, it's the same answer: send it to us and we'll solve the problem after we've reformatted the hard drive. Needless to say, I'm not going to be a Gateway customer again!

Luckily the plugs didn't fit so I didn't fry a new mobo. I was still mad, though. Not only had I wasted the time I put aside for the change over, but now I had to order a new psu and wait for it to arrive. Dell shoud be putting a big red sign on their cases and website: WARNING: Non-standard parts used here. I will never buy from dell again.

Phone support could not diagnose it, so I ended up doing exactly that: getting new chip, motherboard and psu. Fortunately, the warranty had not run out. Point is, Dell could not figure out what was wrong and was willing to replace the whole shebang. If the machine had not been under warranty though, I'd have been out a lot of money.

After two months of getting the red tape runaround and time consuming try this and try that I agreed to a different brand computer and recieved a different one than they promised, I kept it because it was the first one of three that actually worked. Unless you want to be treated like a moron and given the run around steer clear of Tiger Direct.

I keep waiting for the off-shore support to improve, but it's pretty time consuming to work with. Your best bet on newer units is to run the hardware diagnostics on the utility partition of the hard drive (if the machine starts!) before calling, and give the techs the results at the begnning of the call.

With that being said, I can say it's not a huge issue to replace their power supply. All you need to do is call the Dell spare parts dept. and tell them the model. It's $29.95 plus $10.00 shipping for a replacement and they ship them with 2nd day service for that price. It's really a no-brainer! The only issue you may run into is if Dell spare parts give you the run around that they are out of stock. This has happened and it has taken 2 weeks to get a replacement processor cooling fan. Overall they don't usually take to long. Mike D.

I work at a technical college with Dell computers and we have power supply problems all the time. I don't even call the Dell technical support line I just email them and they either send out a replacment part or send a technician to replace the part.

Well maybe? Given that many buildings are underwired for today's technology I wonder if this may be the case for some of you as well. We also replaced 11 power supplies on our last batch of Gateway's.... 11 I beleive of 20 or so over the course of 3 years. Electrician has been called - Dell replaced all seven power supplies - though it took several calls and yes, some poorer service.

I didn't know the PSU appears 'designed' to destroy your computer! i.e. Same connectors, different wires. Jeeze, my sister and her daughter recently bought Dell's. Same with memory modules, though not as bad, or dangerous. Deceptive advertising in my opinion. 'Let the buyer beware' certainly applies to Dell.

My power supply went, called Dell last Thursday, the tech asked me to do some diagnosing routines. In my case, the machine wouldn't boot so answering most of his questions was easy. At the end of the call, he decided to send a new motherboard as well as the power supply. A local tech showed up Monday afternoon, took about 30 minutes to install and test the new parts. I haven't decided whether to extend the warranty but I think, depending on the price, it might be a no brainer. Good Luck everyone Bob
