with photoret 4 you get improved print quality with your pictures lasting up to 65 years.
if you find one with photoret pro, it has the option to use 8 ink printing (ret4 only uses a 6 ink).
the extra two inks dramatically increase quality of colour if your doing black and white printing.
they are greyscale printing.

the drops of ink are smaller with photoret 4 than previous versions, so you get better quality and colour.
