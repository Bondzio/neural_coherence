<s> I'd like to upgrade my Sony PCV-RX650, which currently has the original 80GB ATA/100 hd and 512mb ram(though I'm upgrading memory as well). </s>
<s> I'd like to add a second internal hard drive of 200-250 gb capacity, if possible. </s>
<s> What, if any issues might I have? </s>
<s> From what I understand, ATA/100 or ATA/133 doesn't really matter. </s>
<s> I see some of the drives (Maxtor Ultra 7200 Series) require and additional PCI card slot. </s>
<s> What are the benefits/negatives versus a drive that doesn't require an additional card slot? </s>
<s> All slots are currently occupied, unless I remove the fax/telephony card which isn't used anyway. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on drives/brands? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> What operating system (and service pack number) are you using? </s>
<s> If you are using Windows XP, you need to at least have service pack 1 (SP1) installed to use hard drives over 137GB. </s>
<s> I have not experienced any major differences between ATA/100 and ATA/133. </s>
<s> Your motherboard is ATA/100; however, you still can install an ATA/133 drive. </s>
<s> It will be compatible. </s>
<s> You have two ATA slots on the motherboard, each capable of handling two drives (making four total). </s>
<s> Maxtor wants you to spend money on an ATA hard drive controller card that supports ATA/133 if your integrated ATA hard drive controller is only ATA/100. </s>
<s> It is not required/necessary. </s>
<s> Another issue I see is finding space to insert the drive inside that case. </s>
<s> Try not stack one hard drive directly on top of another with, say, only a cm between them. </s>
<s> Heat is the enemy of computer components, including hard drives. </s>
<s> If you have a free 5.25'' drive bay, you could put the drive there as an option. </s>
<s> If you ever have to install a PCI card for any reason, you can use combination cards to fit all of your functionality. </s>
<s> For example, you can have USB, Firewire, and a 10/100 network port all on one PCI card. </s>
<s> Windows XP Home SP2. </s>
<s> There is a second 3.5'' hard drive bay, but it does place it very close to the other hard drive. </s>
<s> No free 5.25'' bays. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
