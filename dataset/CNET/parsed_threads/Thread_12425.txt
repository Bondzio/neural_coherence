<s> Maybe a dumb question, but is there an easy way to determine the rating of my Power Supply? </s>
<s> I've looked all over the thing, looked up serial numbers, etc., and haven't found anything. </s>
<s> I think it is just generic. </s>
<s> But is there software that can determine the rating? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Look at the side of the supply for a stick like this -&gt; http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg Bob </s>
<s> my sticker didn't quite look like that, but by comparing it with that link you posted, i could figure it out. </s>
<s> thanks again! </s>
<s> There are no stickers/decals/model numbers on the power supply? </s>
<s> Were you able to hold it in your hand and turn it around? </s>
<s> If not, the decal may not be seen on some models while mounted. </s>
<s> If none is found, that doesn't pass the UL provided rating it requires for use in the USA. </s>
<s> Please inform... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Gee Bob, I was interested, and for the life of me could not get the reference link to come up for some time and wondering how Lambo got it to come up. </s>
<s> Could get these: http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_full.jpg http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool420_switch.jpg But not your indicated link: http://www6.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg I finally eliminated the 6 in www and walla: http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/images/aerocool_packing.jpg The image goes with this article: http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/power_supplies-01.html </s>

<s> to see a system that doesn't pass the UL (if it's in the US, if your not in the US idk then) after you find the rating, you should know what some of the figures mean, as wattage isn't all that matters the two thigns you want to look at (3 really, but the third is a bit of an after thought) 1) Total Wattage, 400W is good, 500W for high performance systems (it's due to the high draw by graphics cards and CPU's) 2) the amperage on the 12v rail, or rails, it should be over 24A for a modern system (AthlonXP's and old Pentium 4 (Willamette only) can sag lower, 18A works fine on my AthlonXP, and willamette only needs 10A to 12A (Intel spec) but i'd suggest 16 to be safe ALSO the brand matters, if it's a crap unit than those figures are at 25C, which i doubt your computer is at, as the heat rises it loses efficiency BUT high end units (like PC Power & Cooling) are rated at 50C, which means they are highly efficient </s>
<s> Practically any p/s unit should have some decal/sticker on it or several. </s>
<s> What they all mean in the long term is the p/s is suppose to be able to do what it rated to do and in a safe matter. </s>
<s> Fonding one w/o any sticker/decal or one so simple, should be thought of as either dang cheap or a &quot;dump&quot; of parts from whatever source. </s>
<s> Any maker not willing to ID themselves or seemily so, shouldn't be trusted as well as thier devices/items. </s>
<s> Users have enough problems w/o starting from the git, with less than std. </s>
<s> parts. </s>
