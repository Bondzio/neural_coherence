If anybody can help me I should like to know: The type of organization of the different levels of cache, i.e., if they are associative, direct mapped or N set associative. The answer in clock cycles of a Cache reading. I suppose that level 1 will be read in 1 clock cycle. And what about cache Level 2 and Level 3? Is the memory interface which generates the Wait State if there is a cache miss on Level 1 or is Level 1 by itself? Are the different levels of cache inclusive or exclusive? The policy of writing is Write through or write back?
