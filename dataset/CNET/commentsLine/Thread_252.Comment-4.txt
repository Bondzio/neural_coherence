my nephew has a similar system.
but it's a 1ghz and 256mb.
i fitted a dvdrom drive so he has his own dvd player too.
at 733mhz, that's more than enough for dvd playback, but 128mb will be far too tight.
i'd forget today's games on such a machine.
but 512mb is not a bad idea.
if you find a cheap!!!
geforce 2gts or there abouts, it will deliver about 2x or better the graphic speed, but with that cpu and ram it will never be a gaming machine except for old titles (try the year 2000).
