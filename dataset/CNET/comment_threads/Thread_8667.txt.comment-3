Thanks JB, I'm getting the system for a fair price..from Tigerdirect.
I'm looking forward to the challenge of trying to understand all this &quot;TECH&quot; I've seen both good & bad comments on this system CNET seems to have given it a 7 of 10.
Looking forward to getting the biggest bag for my buck with further research.
Once again thanks for your kind & knowledgeable reply.
