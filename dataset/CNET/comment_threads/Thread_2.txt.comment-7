That you land at the modem+router page then it is very possible the moder+router (sorry can't find where you share it's make, model and settings) is performing as a router.
When you have that situation then you configure the next router as noted in reply 17.
Now you write it worked before but since the modem+router could have been reset and taken up the job of the DHCP server and router we have to forget how it worked before and approach this as if it's the usual new setup.
