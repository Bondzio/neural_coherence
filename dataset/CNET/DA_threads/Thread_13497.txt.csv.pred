1.1.1	Hi ...	St
1.1.2	I have used generic ink cartridges for a long time for my hp psc 950 *printer*fax*scanner*copier* ...	St
1.1.3	However , I do n't think this problem I 'm asking for advice on has to do w/ the cartridge : this time when the black ink ran out , I never got the message on the little screen & quot ; low ink & quot ; replace ink soon or whatever , my copies just got so faint that I replaced the cartridge .	St
1.1.4	Now , the message on my little screen says , & quot ; press enter to align cartridges & quot ; and , when I do so , it begins and the screen reads : & quot ; printing align cartridge page & quot ; then it goes about it 's business for a minute then says , & quot ; alignment failed , please try again & quot ; and I ca n't get past this ... over and over .	St
1.1.5	I take the cartridge out , I replace the cartridge , I even got a new cartridge and , even tho I 'm only replacing the black , I take the color out too and reinsert it : nothing ... and no option to just clear the error and use the machine as is ...	St
1.1.6	I ca n't even send faxes out which requires no ink at all ... any advice ?	Ques
1.1.7	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I seem to have the same problem as you had .	St
1.2.2	Some people suggest faulty cartridges or pressing 'enter ' and 'setup ' at the same time to bypass the alignment .	St
1.2.3	Do n't seem to work for me though .	St
1.3.1	You almost have it .	St
1.3.2	You have to press and hold the 'enter ' button , then press 'setup ' Here 's the HP support document on it : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? lc=en & cc=us & docname=bpu00657 & product=60259 & dlc=en & lang=en	St
