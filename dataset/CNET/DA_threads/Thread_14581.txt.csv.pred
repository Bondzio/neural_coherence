1.1.1	Hello , I have a home network with router Linksys WRTU54G-TM .	St
1.1.2	I have moved my home-office upstairs and would like to use D-Link TM-G5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network .	St
1.1.3	I have tried configuring the TM-G5240 according to the owners manual , but the manual is decidedly thin on details .	St
1.1.4	The last thing I did was to give the D-Link TM-G5240 a static ip address on the home network ( 192.168 .	St
1.1.5	0.140 ) , and to communicate on the same channel ( 6 ) to the home network SSID on the Linksys WRTU54G-TM ip address ( 192.168.0.1 ) using the correct wpa password .	St
1.1.6	When I try to renew the ip address of a wired computer I see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the TM-G5240 .	St
1.1.7	The wired computer never gets a good ip address .	St
1.1.8	Instead it gets a 169.x.x.x address .	St
1.1.9	Please help	St
1.2.1	But it sounds defective .	St
1.2.2	Only the makers can fix that issue .	St
1.2.3	I 've worked around this by manually assigning the IP , Netmask , Default Gateway and DNS entries but sounds defective to me and your choice to live with this .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	The D-link is new out of the box .	St
1.3.2	I would still like to use it as a bridge .	St
1.3.3	Maybe someone else will have a different response .	St
1.3.4	I do have a couple of other wireless routers .	St
1.3.5	They might be better candidates for this experiment..	St
1.3.6	Thanks for your input .	St
1.3.7	Ray	St
1.4.1	Remember I ca n't fix a maker 's broken stuff .	St
1.4.2	New out of the box does n't mean it 's fully debugged and works with all other routers .	St
1.4.3	I noted a workaround but if you ca n't do that , and they fail to fix it with firmware or support , get your money back .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
