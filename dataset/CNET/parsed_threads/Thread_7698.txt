<s> Not many of 4 GB flash drives seem to be rated and there are tons on ebay. </s>
<s> I need one, preferably a USB 2.0, that will be dependable and fast. </s>
<s> Any experiences and/or recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I've got the Corsair Voyager 4GB... it's fast, comes with a nice lanyard with metal clip, USB extension cable (nice for tight spaces with mulitple USB devices connected) and 10 year warranty. </s>
<s> So far it's served me well. </s>
<s> Take a look at the linke below...lots to choose from. </s>

<s> You would find similar results in comparing regular gas for your car. </s>
<s> Outside of cosmetic appearances, write protect switch and maybe some bundled software there isn't much to compare here. </s>
<s> I will write that I own a pair of 1G USB drives and they are nice to have about. </s>
<s> By year end I'll see about getting a 4GB model but until then I picked up a 60GB small drive for same price as the 4GB flash unit. </s>
