<s> Hi I have just recieved a HP photosmart 2610 printer and i want to connect it to my wireless network. </s>
<s> It has and ethernet port so i decided i would connect my ethanet to wireless bridge d-link to the printer and then connect it straight to my home network. </s>
<s> I have a belkin router/modem with wep security ect. </s>
<s> I also have the HP networking guide and CD ROM however all my laptops are Vista so it wont work.Also once i get it hooked up to the network how do i get it to apear on all my laptops. </s>
<s> if any other information is needed just ask. </s>
<s> Thanks Tom </s>
<s> At this point I'd pack it back up and return it before you can't get your money back. </s>
<s> Next time ask if it works with Vista. </s>
<s> Sorry i didnt explain quite right i got the printer for free it is a few years old an since then i was able to get the setup wizard to work but still could not get it connected to the internet the main problem i am having is getting the bridge to connect with the router and reconise it as a printer all suggestions are helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks Tom </s>
<s> can be found here . </s>
<s> Disconnect your printer. </s>
<s> Please make sure to un-install the printer, then restart the computer before installing the proper drivers. </s>

<s> Hi I have installed the drivers but i get the message that the printer is not connected to my network. </s>
<s> The main problem i am having is getting my wireless bridge to communicate with my wireless router. </s>
<s> Thanks Tom </s>
<s> WEP's dead today. </s>
<s> I also see you note a bridge. </s>
<s> Sadly your posts are incomplete so replies fail to get to the answers since you haven't made a good complete post. </s>
<s> Solve one issue at a time. </s>
<s> Such as that bridge. </s>
<s> To try to solve the printer and the bridge at the same time will usually be too hard. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What i want the bridge to do is connect with my wireless router. </s>
<s> this is the thing that is giving me the most problems. </s>
<s> the bridges instructions are incoplete and unhelpful so mabye you can help me. </s>
<s> the bridge is a d-link dwl-g810 and my router is belcon branded. </s>
<s> My router was set up with a security key. </s>
<s> I fyou need anymore information please ask. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help tom </s>
<s> http://support.dlink.com/emulators/dwlg810/wireless.html I see from it's setup that this is not going to be easy enough for me to solve here. </s>
<s> While I have setup these things, unless I was privy to every detail it's too likely what I didn't know had an error. </s>
<s> Find a local network guru and offer pizza and cherry coke and accolades to get this all working. </s>
<s> In closing I used this one -&gt; WGPS606 (see google.com) Its instructions are no better but since I used to write embedded web servers and routers a long time ago it wasn't all that hard to see what they wanted me to do. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your help it is much appreciated. </s>
<s> I will explore some other options. </s>
<s> Thanks Again your help is much appreciated! </s>
<s> Tom </s>
<s> Skip trying to get the printer on the bridge. </s>
<s> Try your PC or laptop and (no offense intended) and their instructions. </s>
<s> This one is not easy so don't feel to bad if it takes a few tries. </s>
<s> Hi, sorry to bother you again. </s>
<s> I tried connecting my bridge into my laptop i found the home page in internet explorer and it will connect to my network but when i get on i can not connect to the internet. </s>
<s> What settings hould i check. </s>
<s> also should i set up an ap???? </s>
<s> Does this make the connection easier if so how o i do this Thanks Tom </s>
<s> On any laptop to disable it's wifi. </s>
<s> My HP, Acer's have a little button for that. </s>
<s> Now I use ethernet to the bridge and follow the directions. </s>
<s> I'm not privy to what you may have changed on the bridge so let me note that I use the bridge's defaults and only set the SSID and password word to the wifi network I want to connect to. </s>
<s> Remember not to lock down any IP here. </s>
<s> We want to get it to work as a bridge first. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
