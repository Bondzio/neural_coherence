www.mrbios.com sells bios and will cross-ship.
your motherboard manufacturer may sell BIOS's also.
if you have a friend with the same motherboard, check the electronics parts supply stores in your area.
they may be able to reprogram your chip from your friend's.
last ditch, very dangerous, not recommended option: if you've got a spare motherboard, you can boot it to DOS, pull that BIOS chip and replace it with yours while the PC is on, and try running the BIOS upgrade for your motherboard.
