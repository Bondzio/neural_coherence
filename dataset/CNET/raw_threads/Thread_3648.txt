I currently use my PC for music composition and internet.. But intend to also start playing a new game coming out called &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;.. After running 3DMark06, my PC only scored a 3350 on the overall tests.. If I do buy a new PC, I do want to see improvement in overall system performance, such as day to day stuff -- but also, in gaming as well. I'm a little confused as to whats what these days, Intel has come out with several new CPU's since this one came out. The Core 2 Duo is a bit confusing as they advertise as 1.87, 2.13, and so on.. And if they are truely faster, I'm very uncertain how much faster.. Although, I do know my FSB is not as fast, nor is my memory speed, which is only 400 mhz and I believe the top is around 667 mhz at the moment.. I'm not looking to plunk down $5000 for a new system, so Alien-***** is out... would appreciate any suggestions you guys might have. thanks

You can eBay the 560J for about $80. (if sony tech support is hard to contact, you can download cpu-z from http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php; if your mainboard chipset is i945 or i975 it *should* support a pentium-d.) 2) consider getting a 7900GS (about $180) or 7950GT (about $240) based video card. you may have to upgrade your power supply for another $50. 3) consider adding another 512mb to 1gb of ram if you have 2 free slots ($60-$120 or so). for about $400 you'd have a pc that won't be very far behind today's curve and should keep you happy till next Christmas at least.

It scans your computer and gives you suggestions based on the game you want to play. It can also detect errors in your hardware setup and gives links to get the newsest drivers for stuff.
