<s> My pastor & church board want to be able to have attendees connect to an intranet wirelessly in order to download sermons on laptop or pda. </s>
<s> Can this be easily accomplished through a wireless router, or do I need something &quot;hot spot&quot; compatible? </s>
<s> Or put them on the church web site. </s>
<s> The hot spot may turn into you providing free tech support for everyone's PC. </s>
<s> It's why we don't at the shop. </s>
