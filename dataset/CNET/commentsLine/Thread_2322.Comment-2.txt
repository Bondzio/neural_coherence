my only question is why buy an sli mobo with a psu and vidcard that won't support it?
i know value is good and it's a good compromise if you plan to go that route in the future.
my philosophy is top-of-the-line or bottom, i would get an even cheaper vid if it's only a temporary card.
good components all around should be a solid rig but no chest hair...yet
