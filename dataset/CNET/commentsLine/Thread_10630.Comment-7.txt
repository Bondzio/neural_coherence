the requirement (from manual) for the fx5500 are: ibm or 100% pc compatible with genuine pentium ii or amd k6-2 class processor or higher.
one available agp 2.0 compliant slot or better, or one available pci slot (as required for your specific card).
windows 95 osr2 (version 4.00.950b), windows 98, me, xp, 2000 or windows nt4.0.
(service pack 5 or 6) 64mb system memory.
50mb of available disk space for full installation.
cd-rom or dvd-rom drive.
i think my pc exceeds all these, but still i have the problem!
nd yes, i have the latest drivers installed.
my friend tells me to reinstall os, but its a real pain, and not guaranteed to work, btw, there is no problem with other tasks in the pc, just games.
