1.1.1	Canon i455 a few years old .	St
1.1.2	Was connected to my PC and shared across my network .	St
1.1.3	A few months ago I got a NAS and connected the printer there , still shared , worked perfectly ( did n't have to turn my PC on for others to print ) .	St
1.1.4	Tried to print a text file this morning , no text .	St
1.1.5	Print head moved but no black ink ( yes , new cartridge ) .	St
1.1.6	Did a nozzle check and all colors and black printed .	St
1.1.7	Tried text file again , everything moved but no text .	St
1.1.8	Moved the printer back to my PC and did a nozzle check .	St
1.1.9	All OK .	St
1.1.10	Tried to print the document , no text .	St
1.1.11	Created a document in Word , same-same .	St
1.1.12	Changed the color of the text to blue and voila !	St
1.1.13	So , it 's not printing black .	St
1.1.14	All printer tests work but no black on any document .	St
1.1.15	Time for a new printer ?	Ques
1.2.1	If this happened after you replaced the ink cart , then its an ink cart issue .	St
1.2.2	Especially , if this is a refilled ink cart or generic type .	St
1.2.3	Newer inkjets use all ink to print its output its really not black unless you have & quot ; mono output & quot ; selection .	St
1.2.4	They do this so all inkjets get used and not become clogged due to non-use .	St
1.2.5	I exclude any possible electronics issue here or introduced s/w glitch .	St
1.2.6	I would suggest you do an alignment , etc test and check results , etc.. if fails or never corrects then replace printer .	Sug
1.2.7	Its probably the cheapest fix , when new ink carts become involved .	St
1.2.8	You could try this printer on an entirely different system that never had it and install it to test .	Sug
1.2.9	If you buy new printer look into similar model or Canon that uses same ink carts to help in that area .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	It prints black , and colors on a nozzle check .	St
1.3.2	New cartridge , and I used it about a week ago .	St
1.3.3	I do not use recycled/generic/refilled cartridges , only Canon fresh out of the box .	St
1.3.4	I 'll install it on my laptop and see what happens .	St
1.4.1	It was out of ink .	St
1.4.2	And I found out something useful .	St
1.4.3	When connected to the NAS the ink monitor does not work .	St
1.4.4	Installed it on the laptop , and after a few times of going through the tests and checks , I looked at the levels .	St
1.4.5	DUH ! !	St
1.4.6	These levels do not show up correctly when connected to the NAS .	St
1.4.7	Put a new cartridge in and voila !	St
1.4.8	The NAS is nice but it will not display the printer monitor .	St
1.5.1	I 'm glad you sorted it all out .	St
1.5.2	Remember the & quot ; ink monitoring pgm. & quot ; is nothing more than estimate or approx .	St
1.5.3	of ink level .	St
1.5.4	Defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install ( align . )	St
1.5.5	starts sometimes this issue and/or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention .	St
1.5.6	Even if not displayed , it has become a sore spot .	St
1.5.7	I wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home .	St
1.5.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
