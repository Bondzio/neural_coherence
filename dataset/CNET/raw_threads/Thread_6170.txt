I have a realtek ethernet attached to the motherboard. According to the specs on the Gateway website and on the specs for my motherboard it is 10/100, but in my device manager it says gigabit. How can I tell if I have gigabit or not? Would a PCI networking card give me better network performance?

Is your network going to be all wired with all computers having Gigabit NIC cards and using cat5e or cat6 wire to network them. If the answer to the above is yes,then there will be a improvement over the 10/100 setup. The Gateway website shows your computer as having 10/100, but the PCI Gagabit cards are pretty cheap and easy to install.

The reason I'm not sure about the computer is that even though the motherboard says it only supports 10/100, in the device manager it says I have &quot;Realtek RTL8168B/8111B family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.0)&quot;. I know that it is built on to the motherboard.

I can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100. I can do the same on my Dell that I know is Gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0Gbps. As I said on my previous post, PCI 10/100/1000 NIC cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play. I would definitely go that route because you will know everything is Gigabit and no gray areas. I believe I paid $22.00 or $23.00 for the last one I bought at Staples. You can actually get them cheaper online, but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time.
