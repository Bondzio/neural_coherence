I'd go with the VH236H.
I would prefer the LED backlight offered in the other but it doesn't show having a DVI port and I want that capability.
As well, the ML238H specifies a glossy black cabinet.
I think the VH236H looks glossy too but the bezel is smaller.
To me, gloss is a distraction to the eye as it creates reflections.
The price of either isn't bad.
If you can live with D-sub and HDMI only and don't mind the glare and larger bezel, an LED backlight has some appeal.
I guess that's a non answer but I'd recommend that you look closely at the features each offers.
