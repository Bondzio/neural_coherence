did you connect it on it's own cable or on a cable already used by another drive?
if on the same cable as an existing drive you need to set it as a slave device.
jumper settings are marked on the drive.
did you check that the cable is connected the right way?
red or black tracer wire nearest the power connector.
did you connect a power connector to the drive?
no drives showing tends to indicate no power or incorrect cable installation.
check all connections and jumper settings and let's know how you get on.
