thanks guys i was a little worried as i didnt actually have a look at my cpu temps befor...its maxed out now at 2319ghz and to be honest its vastly improved the performance of the machine, feels like a new computer!
and i just bought some 1gb ram sticks for it to take it from 1gb upto 2gb as i also let the gpu steel 128mb from the mobo aswell as clock the cpu....
