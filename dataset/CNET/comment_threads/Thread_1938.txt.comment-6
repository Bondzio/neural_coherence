And no BIOS screen it does not look like a settings issue.
It now looks like a PC that needs repair.
As to the &quot;done something to the graphics card?
could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot; I have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure.
Most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply.
Since there is no BIOS, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead PC and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first.
