i have been trying to shop for a new, high quality, flatscreen monitor.
the dell ultrasharp u2711 has very good stats, features and reviews, but it is more than 2 years old, and i find very little info on anything to replace it.
is there anything out there in the same general price range, with equal or better qualities and features?
i know it is supposed to run &quot;hot&quot;, but other than that (and the fact that it is a two-year-old design)....would it be a poor choice for a new purchase?
thanks, jp
