1.1.1	I'm hoping that I'll be able to get some help and some insight to this problem that I'm having.	St
1.1.2	Actually, let me rephrase that.	Sug
1.1.3	To this major and highly annoying a potentially devastating problem that I'm having.	St
1.1.4	I just recently (today) bought a SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB flash drive with retractable port, with U3 technology.	St
1.1.5	I plugged it into my SONY Vaio laptop (model number VGN-FJ170), running Windows XP, Service Pack 2, expecting to see what happened when I popped in my best friend's Memorex 2GB flash drive.	St
1.1.6	I expected it to show the little &quot;Found New Hardware&quot; icon in the system tray, and then after a few seconds, to have it tell me that it was reading the disc, then pop the disc window open, showing the contents of the device, or to have it pop open a window asking me what I wanted to do with the device (&quot;Open Window to Show Files&quot;, or &quot;Do Nothing&quot;).	St
1.1.7	It didn't do that.	St
1.1.8	And also, it took an awful long time for the &quot;Installing New Hardware&quot; icon in the system tray Well, I opened up my My Computer window.	St
1.1.9	It took about 2 minutes to load, and showed the device.	St
1.1.10	Now, I am never a big fan of what companies think I need to have preinstalled on my flash disc, not to mention that they're usually in FAT format.	St
1.1.11	I always format them to FAT32, thus thereby making it FAT32 AND removing all preinstalled software.	St
1.1.12	to disappear.	St
1.1.13	Well, it wouldn't let me access it from Windows Explorer (my computer).	St
1.1.14	Actually, let me rephrase that.	Sug
1.1.15	Windows Explorer was blank on parts of it (like you see when you're running too many applications, and you open My Computer, and it takes a long time to load, or when you switch windows).	St
1.1.16	Luckily I had a shortcut on my desktop to the drive letter that it was assigned (F:\), so I double-clicked that to view what was inside the flash drive.	St
1.1.17	There was a disc labeled &quot;U3&quot;, a folder labeled &quot;Documents&quot; and some other folder that I forget.	St
1.1.18	The U3 disc and the other documents, I believe were hidden also.	St
1.1.19	Well, on My Computer, it finally showed the drive, so I clicked on it to select it, and then My Computer took a long time again.	St
1.1.20	It seemed to be taking a LOOOOOOONNNG time to access the drive, so I gave up and killed the Windows Explorer process from the task manager again, and then restarted Windows Explorer via the task manager (explorer.exe).	St
1.1.21	Again I tried to access the drive.	St
1.1.22	And again it was lagging horribly.	St
1.1.23	I finally was able to figure out the right-click the shortcut icon on my desktop and select format.	St
1.1.24	I formatted it twice.	St
1.1.25	I then checked the drive.	St
1.1.26	It was empty.	St
1.1.27	Yet My Computer still lagged when I tried to access the drive.	St
1.1.28	And now, I found another nuissance (sp?).	St
1.1.29	I noticed it had installed a new CD drive on my computer.	St
1.1.30	What the heck???	St
1.1.31	I located the drive in the device manager and under the CD ROM & DVD ROM drives, it said that it was a SanDisc U3 Cruzer Micro Disc, or something to that effect.	St
1.1.32	I know that it knew it was a SanDisc Disc, and that it was a Cruzer Micro, and that it was U3, but I don't remember the exact labeling.	St
1.1.33	I got so frustrated, I restarted my computer a few times.	St
1.1.34	And I still experienced lag with My Computer.	St
1.1.35	I'm only having lag with &quot;My Computer&quot;, mind you, not Windows Explorer itself.	St
1.1.36	As long as I stay away from &quot;My Computer&quot; and only use drive letters and direct paths typed into the path directory, Windows Explorer acts zippy.	St
1.1.37	But when I get onto &quot;My Computer&quot;, it lags horribly.	St
1.1.38	I tried opening this new CD drive that it had installed, and when I did, I received a message stating that it was in a format that Windows did not recognize, and that the disc could be corrupted.	St
1.1.39	Well, I Quick Formatted it again and formatted it a few more times.	St
1.1.40	Then, via the shortcut, I loaded some pictures, music and other stuff onto the drive.	St
1.1.41	I accessed them via the shortcut, and everything worked fine.	St
1.1.42	Pictures looked perfect, music played great, via WinAMP and I was able to save text documents to it just fine (that I had copied into the drive and opened via the shortcut).	St
1.1.43	I decided to plug in my best friend's Memorex drive into my computer to test it out (if it was my USB ports, or my Plug and Play stuff).	St
1.1.44	Well, &quot;My Computer&quot; lagged again.	St
1.1.45	I got so ticked off that I pulled out the SanDisc flash drive.	St
1.1.46	OH MY GOSH.	St
1.1.47	&quot;My Computer&quot; instantly and magically refreshed itself, showing that my best friend's Memorex was installed and everything was speedy, as it should be (also, that extra CD drive disappeared).	St
1.1.48	Then I replugged in the SanDisc.	St
1.1.49	Lag AGAIN!!!	St
1.1.50	I replaced my SanDisc with a brand new one, thinking it could have been the memory (which was dumb to think, because all my data I had put onto it worked flawlessly.	St
1.1.51	I went the the same hell with formatting this drive and taking care of everything.	St
1.1.52	And it's still causing my &quot;My Computer&quot; to lag and still showing up with that dumb extra CD drive.	St
1.1.53	What the heck?	St
1.1.54	If this is what U3 does to computers, I will never ever buy another U3 enabled flash disc drive, and to be honest, this has soured my view towards SanDisc, because I called them to get support, but it was after hours, and their QuickStart guide mentions none of this, and in fact is only for people using something other than Windows XP.	St
1.1.55	It mentions nothing about that stupid little CD drive that shows up, and I hate it.	St
1.1.56	I have also tried plugging the flash drive itself into other computers, and get the same results (laggy &quot;My Computer&quot;) and tried plugging new flash drives into my computer (borrowed from students around my school's library) and their's all install fine and doesn't affect the speed of &quot;My Computer&quot;.	St
1.1.57	This flash drive is supposed to be taken to school and back and forth between computers.	St
1.1.58	I cannot be sitting in front of a computer screen, waiting for &quot;My Computer&quot; to catch up because of that stupid flash drive.	St
1.1.59	That's not an option.	St
1.1.60	I need to be able to pop in my flash drive, have the computer I'm using detect the new hardware, load it, access my data, and then be on my way.	St
1.1.61	This is not an option.	St
1.1.62	Has anyone else had experience with U3 flash drive, particularly this model?	Ques
1.1.63	I am at wit's end, and am so ticked, that honestly I think I'd get more enjoyment from smashing the flash drive and burning it than exchanging it for a new one.	St
1.1.64	Can someone help me please??	Ques
1.1.65	?	Ques
1.2.1	Okay, been messing around with some stuff regarding the flash drive, and discovered something.	St
1.2.2	I went into the Device Manager and disabled the suspicious SanDisc &quot;CD ROM drive&quot; and now it doesn't cause &quot;My Computer&quot; to lag.	St
1.2.3	What the heck is that drive?	St
1.2.4	I'm gonna' call up SanDisc tomorrow (or Monday, if they're not open on Sunday) and try to figure out what in the world that is, but I'm guessing it's some kind of hardware, but can't figure out why it's there, as it's a flash drive, not a CD ROM drive, and it's quite annoying to have to go into the settings and change disable the stupid little CD ROM drive in the Device Manager (when I plug it in at school) just to be able to use it at school.	St
1.2.5	Also, at school they actually may have disabled it so that I can't even access the Device Manager, so this may not even be an option.	St
1.2.6	I do see several options available, but none of them are that good.	St
1.2.7	1) Unplug the device everytime I want to access &quot;My Computer&quot; Reasoning of why this isn't acceptable: I don't have to do this with any other flash drive, why should I have to with this one?	St
1.2.8	2) Disable it in the Device Manager.	St
1.2.9	Reasoning of why this isn't acceptable: I shouldn't have to do this, and on school computers, I may NOT even be able to.	St
1.2.10	3) Get a different flash drive.	St
1.2.11	Reasoning of why this isn't acceptable: This flash drive shouldn't be causing these kind of problems, and other people will be having the same problems like me, so it's stupid to just pass the buck, without finding out the solution, so I can help other people who experience this problem.	St
1.3.1	The whole point of the U3 drive is to have autorun/autoload apps.	St
1.3.2	This is why it creates an extra CD Drive on your computer.	St
1.3.3	If you just wanted a dumb memory stick, that's what you should have bought.	St
1.3.4	You paid a major premium for the U3 Software - which you immmediatly reformated/deleted?!	St
1.3.5	See www.u3.com	St
1.4.1	I did read up on U3, at their website.	St
1.4.2	It says NOTHING about adding an extra CD drive to the computer.	St
1.4.3	NOTHING.	St
1.4.4	In addition, I bought it from a friend, brand new for $50, so don't go assuming that I paid premium for that.	St
1.4.5	Anyways, I found a U3 Firmware remover, which cleared out that crappy U3 drive, and made it a normal flash drive, but in a really cool &quot;suit&quot;.	St
1.4.6	Find it here: http://www.no-install.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=72	St
1.5.1	Hello, I work for SanDisk and have been asked to contact you regarding the issue you had with your U3 Cruzer Micro.	St
1.5.2	Although you have since resolved the issue by removing U3, we would like to make you an offer.	St
1.5.3	We will advance replace your drive with a non-U3 drive of the same capacity, as well as a 1GB U3 drive.	St
1.5.4	This is in order to compensate you for the issues you experienced, and so we can get that drive back for failure analysis.	St
1.5.5	The slowness you experienced should not have happened.	St
1.5.6	Please reply with your e-mail address and (if you wish) your phone number and we will contact you.	Sug
1.5.7	If you do not wish to post it here, you can send an e-mail to sandisk_technical@yahoo.com.	St
1.5.8	Thank you, Jason SanDisk Technical Support	St
1.6.1	Wow!	St
1.6.2	Now that's customer service!	St
1.7.1	Yes, that is good customer service, but there are a few things that worry me, and many may have problems with what I will say.	St
1.7.2	First, as I said in the original reply to that post is that I am worried that it is an &quot;@yahoo.com&quot; e-mail, and not an &quot;@sandisk.com&quot; e-mail.	St
1.7.3	As we all know, this is the internet, and anyone can say they are anyone, so my fear on this subject is very rational, regarding the info I gave.	St
1.7.4	I can just see giving my phone number to someone who just wants to prank call me.	St
1.7.5	The second issue I have (that many people will probably bash me for) is that I do think it's cool that I'd be getting in essence, 3 gigabytes in exchange for 2 gigabytes, but while that is very cool, I did buy the Cruzer Micro w/ Retractable USB Connector for form factor also.	St
1.7.6	As in the e-mail that I wrote SanDisk, I know they are very aware that their consumers like physical attributes when choosing their flash drives.	St
1.7.7	This is obvious in the Cruzer Micro w/ Changeable Skins.	St
1.7.8	The consumer would buy this because they like the ability to change the way it looks.	St
1.7.9	Well, I LOVE the way my Micro looks.	St
1.7.10	It is so small, and has a retractable USB connector, so I don't lose the cap.	St
1.7.11	The Cruzer Micro w/ Skins has a cap, so it may get lost.	St
1.7.12	I have a Micro (non U3) without skins that looks just like the one with skins, and the cap is lost somehwere, so I use the sleeve to hold it, and even that is loose, so the retractable USB connector is a big thing for me.	St
1.7.13	However, the only other current one that is available with a retractable port is the Titanium, but it is too big for me (hey, I'm the consumer, I have every right to be picky here).	St
1.7.14	To be honest, I'd be happy with another U3 Cruzer Micro w/ Retractable USB Connector, since I am able to clear out the firmware, as I bought it for the looks, not anything else (except size).	St
1.7.15	To prevent someone else from e-mailing SanDisk in an attempt to get a free 1 GB flash drive, I will post this here.	St
1.7.16	I AM NOT GOING TO BE CONTACTING SANDISK UNTIL I HAVE CONFIRMATION AND SOME ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS TRULY SANDISK POSTING THIS, AND NOT SOME SCAMMER OR A PRANKSTER.	St
1.7.17	Thanks again.	Polite
1.8.1	That is understandable.	St
1.8.2	Please e-mail ProductSupport@sandisk.com instead.	St
1.8.3	I am out of the office currently, so I will get someone to check the e-mail (this is why I initially gave the yahoo address).	St
1.8.4	Alternatively, if you e-mailed us through our website, please reply with the 6 digit case number (which no one else would be able to look up) so I can find your e-mail to us.	Sug
1.9.1	The message has been sent, and it will be quite obvious as to the subject, due to the subject line.	St
1.10.1	I cannot stand the software either.	St
1.10.2	I does slow down your system and the device would not work with my cars' MP3 USB reciever.	St
1.10.3	It just kept displaying read error.	Polite
1.10.4	I do not understand why would want such a useless function.	St
1.10.5	A flash drive is just that a flash drive, not a portable fake CD.	St
1.10.6	Also the program selection for U3 is stupid, just below parr dung.	St
1.10.7	I also removed the U3 software and now it works with my USB receiver and I am happy.	St
1.11.1	Good deal, glad that it's working for you.	St
1.11.2	Some people like it, but personally, I prefer having MY OWN option of what I want to run from my drive.	St
1.11.3	I don't like being told what to have on my drive, or have it tried to be forced on me.	St
1.11.4	http://www.snapfiles.com/features/ed_usb_software.html I liked &quot;Country Codes, CurrPorts, Drive Manager, Restoration, SmartSniff and YamiPod (this one doesn't apply to you).	St
1.11.5	http://www.theinfobox.com/index.php/Portable_USB_Apps I liked &quot;HoverIP, Angry IP Scanner, DiskView, FolderSize, NetStumbler, Process Explorer, TCPView and FSResizer.	St
1.12.1	Actually...	St
1.12.2	I'm not turning cartwheels.	St
1.12.3	I bought the Memorex U3 drive when it first came out.	St
1.12.4	Specifically I wanted it to bring my work computer desktop, files, and outlook home.	St
1.12.5	Unfortunately Memorex didn't warn me the software was a dumbed down version - outlook sync wasn't available.	St
1.12.6	I was pretty disappointed and have been waiting on the Sandisk U3 because it did include the outlook sync software.	St
1.12.7	I like the U3 idea because I plug it in at work, sync, take it home, plug it in, go right on working.	St
1.12.8	Thanks for the links you posted - I hadn't run across snapfiles before	St
1.13.1	Glad that you liked it.	St
1.13.2	I personally am always on the lookout for software that doesn't write to the registry, or elsewhere, so I can trasfer it to my flash drive and make it portable.	St
1.14.1	In my opinion, the advantage of the U3 drive is the security it affords.	St
1.14.2	The CD drive that shows up should autorun the U3 launchpad which can be configured to prompt for a password.	St
1.14.3	If you don't enter the correct password, the r/w partition of the drive is locked out.	St
1.14.4	I imagine that you have never lost anything in your life, but I want to be assured that if I lose my U3 drive, someone else can't easily get to all the data on it.	St
1.14.5	The U3 apps are pretty wimpy, but that's not the point.	St
1.15.1	Spread the word: if you have a Sandisk U3 Cruzer that isn't recognized properly by Windows, the problem is a conflict between U3 and some other CD/DVD burning application on your PC.	St
1.15.2	Go to http://www.U3.com for support.	St
1.15.3	I didn't even bother with uninstalling NERO to test their theory.	St
1.15.4	I went to: http://www.u3.com/uninstall/ then downloaded and ran the U3 uninstall exe (on a pc that worked with the U3 Cruzer).	St
1.15.5	Now I have a single 1GB drive instead of a 6MB CD and &lt;1GB drive.	St
1.15.6	Sure the U3 promises a lot of great things, but I needed a USB key that works on any PC, not a portable user preferences/email documents folder.	St
1.15.7	I am much happier now	St
1.16.1	U3 had a conflict with something on my home PCs.	St
1.16.2	According to the U3 website, it is probably my NERO CD/DVD burning software.	St
1.16.3	The U3 people are smoking something if they think their software is worth uninstalling my DVD burner support.	St
1.16.4	I got this 1GB USB key for $40.	St
1.16.5	I didn't buy it for the U3, and the U3 doesn't work on half the PCs I plug it into... so coutesy of the uninstaller provdided at the official U3 website, I fixed the key so it works in all of the PCs I use now	St
1.17.1	Hi Everyone, I've just joined this forum after finding it through a Google including words like &quot;U3&quot;, &quot;removal&quot; and &quot;partition&quot;.	St
1.17.2	What excellent stuff, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who hates this patronising U3 cr@p. Sorry this first post is a long one, but some of you might find it interesting/instructive!	St
1.17.3	I've just bought a Sandisk Cruzer Titanium 2Gb drive, and it includes U3, plus news that the drive only works on Mac, Win2K or XP, and not earlier versions of Windows.	St
1.17.4	As someone who still uses Win98 (don't ask why, but the reasons are manifold) I was somewhat pi$$ed that my new purchase was going to be useless ... ... or was it?	St
1.17.5	I pushed the thing into a USB socket on a spare machine running Win2K Server, and all the U3 stuff started up.	St
1.17.6	Apart from taking an age to fire up (this machine was an old PII 300MHz laptop that I use for testing), it was an embarassing pile of poo that subsequently appeared on the screen.	St
1.17.7	Luckily, I noted the &quot;Remove&quot; option, and tried it.	St
1.17.8	Several message boxes and dialogs tried to convince me otherwise, but I soldiered on, and eventually was told I now had a &quot;plain&quot; USB mass storage device.	St
1.17.9	Hooray!	St
1.17.10	But how to get it to work under Win98?	St
1.17.11	I downloaded Sandisks's old Cruzer Titanium drivers, and plugged my newly U3-stripped dongle into my main Win98SE desktop machine.	St
1.17.12	Windows &quot;found&quot; the unknown device, but could not handle it.	St
1.17.13	The SandDisk drivers did not cut the mustard.	St
1.17.14	But &quot;hey&quot;, I thought, &quot;if Windows 2K now sees this as a standard bulk USB mass storage device, why can't I use a generic or even proprietory driver on Win98?&quot;.	St
1.17.15	I did a Google, and found that later versions of Windows (ME onwards) use an INF file called USBSTOR.INF, and a driver called USBSTOR.SYS, to do USB storage things.	St
1.17.16	WinME didn't have the INF file, but did have the SYS file, and I borrowed Win2K's version of the INF.	St
1.17.17	Moments later, my 2K/XP-only SandDisk (U3-) drive was picked up, registered, and seemed to be working on Win98.	St
1.17.18	I could FORMAT it, CHKDSK it, and even store the odd file on in.	St
1.17.19	But once in a while, it just locked up.	St
1.17.20	But so, it turned out, did my existing Kingston DataTraveller II cards under the new regime.	St
1.17.21	I thought a bit longer, and began to wonder whether the Kingston drivers could handle the Sandisk: it was just a case of getting Win98 to understand that PU20SYSD (from Kingston) was a generic bulk driver that could power the Cruzer Titanium (ex-U3) from Sandisk.	St
1.17.22	So I ran REGEDIT, to see which strings had been associated with the Sandisk and UBSTOR, and cross-referenced this against the UBSTOR.INF file.	St
1.17.23	I found an entry, relating to: USB\Class_08&SubClass_06&Prot_50 I added a couple of lines to my Kingston PU20 INF file, using the above string, and then reset my registry to before the Titanium U3 experiments (something that's very easy in Win98), and restarted Windows ... ... &quot;New Hardware Found&quot;.	St
1.17.24	&quot;USB Bulk Storage Device&quot;.	St
1.17.25	So far, so good.	St
1.17.26	&quot;Sandisk U3 Titanium&quot;: even better.	St
1.17.27	The next thing I know, I have a new drive letter, K:, and full access to my U3-stripped Titanium 2048!!	St
1.17.28	So, in short, the steps I needed were: 1) Windows 2000; run U3 remove option, reformat drive 2) Windows 2000, grab USBSTOR.INF - it contains some lines you are going to want 3) Download Kingston (not Sandisk) drivers (for DataTraveler), and install (PU20SUSD.SYS and PU20DISK.PDR).	St
1.17.29	4) Edit Kingston's INF file to include the two entries: [USBDRV] %GenericBulkOnly.DeviceDesc%=usbdrv.Dev,USB\Class_08&SubClass_06&Prot_50 [Strings] GenericBulkOnly.DeviceDesc=&quot;USB Mass Storage Device&quot; 5) Plug in your &quot;2K/XP/Mac-only&quot;, ex-U3 Sandisk drive, and enjoy a U3-free experience on your ancient version of Windows.	St
1.17.30	Brian	St
1.18.1	Impressive, you didn't even need the U3 Removal tool to remove the U3 from your device!	St
1.18.2	Wow!	St
1.18.3	That's so impressive, also, that you got it to work with your Win98 machine.	St
1.18.4	Nice!	St
1.19.1	Removing U3 was the easy bit for me: my Launchpad menu included a &quot;Remove&quot; option, which I duly clicked.	St
1.19.2	It presented in exactly the same was as the downloadable Remove tool, so I assume that's what it was.	St
1.19.3	Having the remove tool built in certainly takes some of the sting out of U3, but I would still rather get my USB memory dongles 100% clean, maybe with a piece of paper inviting you to download and install U3 if you really want it!	St
1.19.4	Brian	St
1.20.1	That's nice.	St
1.20.2	My U3 crap slowed the computer down so much that I never was even able to see what was on my drive.	St
1.20.3	Maybe there WAS something in it that could uninstall it.	St
1.21.1	Why on earth do you need an entire GUI and set of patronising menus in order to secure data?	St
1.21.2	Do you ever do backups?	St
1.21.3	To CD or DVD?	St
1.21.4	If not, one day you're going to have problems that make stolen data look like a day in paradise.	St
1.21.5	If you do make backups, do you encrypt the CD/DVD?	St
1.21.6	Not doing so leaves your data open to being stolen, just as with a USB thumb drive.	St
1.21.7	And if you do use encryption (eg PGP), the same code works with your USB drive.	St
1.21.8	I've never even seen an independent critical peer review of whatever encryption might or might not be built into U3.	St
1.21.9	If I was worried about security (and/or did not have my own existing mechanism for enforcing it), I wouldn't trust a mere password dialog.	St
1.21.10	Brian	St
1.22.1	The point is that if you happen to lose your usb drive, the casual user won't be able to access your data.	St
1.22.2	According to U3.com, if you don't have the password, you can't get to the data.	St
1.22.3	Yes, I know this can probably be defeated, but the security is already there, I don't have to ensure that a certain type of security is available on all computers I use and it's simple.	St
1.22.4	I've seen other people who use encryption to access their data and have not been impressed.	St
1.22.5	From my experience, having to decrypt everything while reading or writing to the device is unacceptably slow.	St
1.22.6	Personally, I am not insulted by having a GUI pop up and I don't see why it's a big deal.	St
1.22.7	A short initial delay to gain access access to the device is better than a delay every time the device is accessed.	St
1.23.1	I don't NEED a GUI for security.	St
1.23.2	I am a mouse person (not a huge linux fan) and prefer to click on items (those pesky menus) rather than have to navigate using the keyboard.	St
1.23.3	I don't carry my backup CD to the library with me.	St
1.23.4	I'm far less concerned about someone breaking into my house and stealing my backup than I am absent-mindedly leaving my U3 device somewhere.	St
1.23.5	Again, the backup is created and filed - not left where it can easily be stolen.	St
1.23.6	When security is enabled, the data partition is not accessable until the password is entered.	St
1.23.7	This may not be foolproof but it is automatic & already installed.	St
1.23.8	See my previous post for further responses.	St
1.24.1	My PC didn't even detect the flashdrive in My Computer In fact, when i click on My Computer it froze the window, i can't even eject the drive, it froze it too.	St
1.24.2	Now when i click on My Computer even without the flashdrive inserted the window would freeze and not display anything.	St
1.24.3	I removed Nero completely but no difference, now i goto reformat my C drive :((((	St
1.25.1	I tried your method (to the best of my ability).	St
1.25.2	I have a machine running on XP, and I found the two USBSTOR files there.	St
1.25.3	The .INF file had the [STRINGS] line present (as well as two other such lines differing in the PROT number.	St
1.25.4	I added the [USBDRV] line and fired it up.	St
1.25.5	W98 recognized my drive, and told me that my new hardware had been installed.	St
1.25.6	But upon restarting the computer, it no longer recognizes the drive, and the drive light goes out almost immediately.	St
1.25.7	(before the experiment, it would stay on until the New Harrdware Wizerd closed).	St
1.25.8	I would like to perform the next step, resetting the registry (You said it was simple, but I have no idea how to do it) to try the Kingston drivers.	St
1.25.9	My Kingston D/L had no .INF file, however.	St
1.25.10	I had D/Ld the Kingston info for my Data Traveller (original version).	St
1.25.11	My network of machines consists mostly of Dell Optiplex, both GX1 and GX110.	St
1.25.12	(These can be found on eBay occasionally for $30, with shippping the same amount).	St
1.25.13	i also have a Toshiba Tecra 750cdt that was without a HDD, and have it running DOS 6.22 with USB installed.	St
1.25.14	It is a little flaky, telling me that I have invalid media, but on the RETRY it works perfectly.	St
1.25.15	If anyone is interested in the mechanism for USB in DOS, let me know.	St
1.26.1	All, if you are having problems with your Sandisk U3 drive not being recognized in Windows XP, I found this myself (after over a month trying to get help from Sandisk tech support....) there appears to be a conflict with RAMASST.exe, which is a DVD driver installed by some DVD manufacturers.	St
1.26.2	Fortunately, I don't use my DVD drive much, since it is an external drive (Toshiba M200 TabletPC doesn't have a built in DVD/CD).	St
1.26.3	I found that disabling RAMASST.exe in the startup configuration allows the Sandisk Cruzer to work... Not sure what that is going to do to your ability to use your DVD drive though.... Interestingly enough I have a Geek Squad U3 USB drive which does NOT have this issue.....	St
1.27.1	Does anyone know how to turn my cruzer into a plain USB drive?	Ques
1.27.2	The problem is that I formatted it on my home PC and copied some files onto it.	St
1.27.3	But at work, it seems as though the format did not work (although it seems to have worked), and I can't find the files that I copied onto it.	St
1.27.4	All I want is a plain USB drives.	St
1.27.5	I don't want to run any software from it or do anything fancy with it.	St
1.27.6	All I want is to copy files onto it, and use it anywhere.	St
1.28.1	Here's your solution.	St
1.28.2	You can't format the drive, you have to remove the U3 software.	St
1.28.3	http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=70&threadID=174791&messageID=1945000	St
1.29.1	I have read most of this thread and having a difficult time concerning what to do for my case of Win ME not recognizing my Sandisk Cruzer flash drive.	St
1.29.2	Windows launches &quot;found new hardware&quot;, but can not find the driver.	St
1.29.3	I have pointed this to c:\windows\inf with still no luck.	St
1.29.4	I have tried to install win98 driver but setup indicates that is is not needed.	St
1.29.5	The jump drive works good on my XP system so I believe the hardware is good.	St
1.29.6	My win me system is a Sony Vaio.	St
1.29.7	Any help would be appreicated.	St
1.29.8	Thanks	Polite
1.30.1	When you get a flash drive you expect to get a load of crap that the designers assume you want but getting a virtual cd drive and an auto-running exe is just going to far.	St
1.30.2	I mean normally I get a new drive and format it and the crap is gone but no not with U3.	St
1.30.3	You have to run a windows only uninstaller.	St
1.30.4	Instead of the drive having an uninstaller it should have had an installer so people could install it if they wanted and delete the piece of crap if they didn't.	St
1.30.5	One of my dumbass friends brought a U3 drive and I am not letting him take it near my computer (and he's not using mine after his useless computer corrupted mine).	St
1.30.6	Anyhow thats my rant over.	St
1.30.7	I just hope no one else has to endure the bloatware that is U3.	St
1.31.1	Did you ever get that resloved?	St
1.31.2	I have the same problem.	St
1.32.1	NIL	St
1.33.1	I bought some Sandisk Cruzer 4Gb U3 drives as Costco.	St
1.33.2	These drives messed up my desktop and my notebook.	St
1.33.3	It has taken me a week to recover the problems.	St
1.33.4	Before putting my first Sandisk Cruzer 4Gb U3 drive in my machines never failed to read a USB drive.	St
1.33.5	After putting in my Sandisk Cruzer 4Gb U3 drive on the second attempt the drive was not identified.	St
1.33.6	Not only that no USB drive or hard drive was recognized.	St
1.33.7	The solution required deleting the INFCACHE.1 file and modifying the registry entry to find the device path for the usb device drivers.	Sug
1.33.8	This took 3 days of research.	St
1.33.9	Thanks Sandisk.	St
1.33.10	Warning to all NEVER buy a U3 Cruzer or you will be sorry.	St
1.33.11	I'm an independent computer consultant and had a employee at a client site bring in a U3 Cruzer and sure enough same thing on the client machine.	St
1.33.12	So far I've seen U3 Cruzer disable USB on three different machines from different manufactures.	St
1.33.13	All running Windows XP.	St
1.33.14	What a piece of Crap.	St
1.33.15	I replaced the U3 with PNY USB drives no problems.	St
1.34.1	I thought I was picking up a USB drive so I could transport some bootable files from my laptop to a new PC I'm building and it is has this U3 software on it making it act like some kind of living animal infecting my PC.	St
1.34.2	I've never seen anything like it.	St
1.34.3	It is just like a virus.	St
1.34.4	I looked into add/remove software and I formatted the drive and then it came back.	St
1.34.5	If you format a drive and there is still hidden information on it then it really isn't your drive.	St
1.34.6	This is just dirty.	St
1.34.7	When did USB drives start including stuff like this?	St
1.34.8	SanDisk from now on I will pay a premium to get CLEAN USB drives.	St
1.34.9	Man it has been a couple years since I bought a USB drive.	St
1.34.10	When did they start turning into this garbage.	St
1.34.11	Putting software where you totally do not expect it is utter and complete garbage.	St
1.34.12	I feel dirty.	St
1.34.13	Now I have yet another thing I have to watch out for when I make a purchase.	St
1.34.14	Thanks for nothing.	St
1.35.1	I got one of those and I didn't even notice U3 was there.	St
1.35.2	I must be lucky.	St
