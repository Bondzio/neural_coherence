I'm looking at getting a netbook for travel purposes, and just to not have to boot up my bulky 5yr old Toshiba laptop all the time. I just want to be able to do quick emails/basic web stuff on the road, and the big thing is I want to be able to do Skype video calls. So, my question is, what netbook do you recommend/not recommend for this? I want a built-in webcam, too. There's a special on an e-machines brand right now I was thinking about. Suggestions?

They have a 90 day trail during which you can return it. It has 1GB Ram and 160 GB hard drive. I want it for travel, checking emails, Skype, etc. I love it. Skype works great and connects easily to the Internet. I am really happy with it. I have used and HP laptop for 6 years and tis Acer is waaaay better! Jim
