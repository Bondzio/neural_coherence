this question is also posted in the digital music forum.
i'm thinking about converting my entire cd collection to mp3's.
i understand the musicmatch jukebox is among the best pieces of software for ripping cd's to mp3.
my question comes in with hardware.
i know the hard way to do this is to manually feed each cd into the tray and let the software do it's thing.
however, i have 200+ cd's (i haven't really counted, but it's a fairly high number).
can anyone think of a way to rig up one of those 100 disc cd changers for stereo systems to automate the process of ripping a cd collection?
thanks for any thoughts/advice.
