<s> How do you change the orientation of addresses when printing an envelope? </s>
<s> I am trying to print a C6 (a5) envelope with the address going across the page not down. </s>
<s> any ideas????? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Just sharing that a bug in one of the Word programs had the onscreent display flipped about and only an office patch fixed that. </s>
<s> But what some won't do and I don't know why is to plow ahead and print that envelope. </s>
<s> But here's how I know where to put the envelope. </s>
<s> I print one test output on a full sheet of paper then that helps me sort out where and how to feed the envelope. </s>
<s> Hope it helps. </s>
