1.1.1	HP a1250 - AMD Duel Core 3800+, 250 gb hd, 1gb ram cost - $793 HP M7248 - AMD Duel Core 4200+, all the rest the same PLUS addition of TV Tuner Cost - $993 Question: For 'normal' use such as internet, digital photos, light movie editing from camcorder, downloading mp3's, is the extra $200 worth it to jump to the 4200+.	St
1.1.2	I kind of want the tv tuner, but can live without it or think I could always add later.	St
1.1.3	Are these good prices?	Polite
1.1.4	just about 1k for a AMD 4200+ dual seems like it is.	St
1.1.5	thoughts?	St
1.1.6	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	actually once I print the specs I did notice the a1250 just has an integrated ATI Radeon XPRESS video card, 255mb memory, while the m7248 has a ATIRadeon PCI-E card with TV tuner.	St
1.2.2	Does that mean the m7248 has a better video card since it is PCI-E versus integrated (plus obviously i know it includes the tuner).	St
1.3.1	I say you do get the HP M7248.	St
1.3.2	It is always good to have a graphics card and it seems the HP M7248 has an ATI All-In-Wonder card which is a combination of a graphics card and a tv tuner.	St
1.3.3	The HP M7248 has a better duel core processor, a tv tuner, and graphics card which are all $200+ upgrades if you got the HP A1250.	St
1.3.4	The HP M7248 is also at a better value.	St
1.3.5	If you can live without the latest and the greatest, then the A1250 will suit you just fine and can handle all the chores you throw at it.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
