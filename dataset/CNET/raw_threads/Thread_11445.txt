Just recently on extreemly hot days (32 + Celsius) the PC tends to sound noisier.What is causing this? The builder of the PC has moved so I can't ask them the reason Bob Phillips

Proffitt	10/29/06 3:24 PM	1.16213544E12	What is causing this?	&quot;It doesn't know the words.&quot; Blatent ripoff quote from http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=60&threadID=212306&messageID=2275621 The other usual cause is a fan that is wearing out. These are cheap and easy parts to replace. And critical to keeping the machine running well. It's also possible the fan runs faster when it's hotter. In that case it's fine too. Bob

After cleaning finished with 1/4 inch of dust in a ball.Now I'm worried as I can't hear it & have to check if it's on. Would an ioniser placed near the PC help in keeping the dust to a minimum?
