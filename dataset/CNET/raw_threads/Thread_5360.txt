There is nothing wrong with that. Everything works fine. The problem now is this: I went out and bought a DVI to HDMI cable. I plugged it into my Graphics Card, and then the other end to the TV. When I boot up the computer, it shows images on both the monitor and TV (which is what I want), but as soon as the actual Windows Kernel loads, the picture on the TV goes to the blank blue screen. Can anybody help?

When we connected it through an RGB cable, it handled a resolution of 1280x768. It just doesn't show up through the DVI to HDMI cable.

You will have to enable your second monitor in your display control panel. It's pretty easy to do. Here is a link I found that will walk you through the process, so I don't have to type it all out: http://www.multi-monitors.com/SUPER_PC_Multi_Monitor_Computer_Setup_Instructions_s/40.htm I actually have my HDTV as a second monitor so I know it works. It's just not automatic &quot;plug and play&quot;. It must be enabled. Hope that helps everyone out!
