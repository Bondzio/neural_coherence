1.1.1	I am interested in buying a wireless projector for home use .	St
1.1.2	I plan to mount it to the ceiling .	St
1.1.3	It will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display ( not for gaming ) .	St
1.1.4	The projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet .	St
1.1.5	Ideally I would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution , but could live with less .	St
1.1.6	Most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $ 1000.00 .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone recommend a good projector or two , that is under $ 1000.00 ( including the networking capability ) .	Ques
1.1.8	Also , do I need a special wireless router to use it ?	Ques
1.1.9	I just have a broadband wireless router ( Linksys WRT160N ) , will this work for this purpose ?	Ques

1.2.1	You did n't explain what Wifi has to do with your usual projector .	St

1.2.3	to the projector .	St
1.2.4	I could be wrong .	St

1.3.1	That seems like a pretty unique option .	St
1.3.2	Although it mentions that it is for use with a TV , I assume that plugging that into the USB port of a projector , that it should transmit the image through ?	Ques
1.3.3	I though most projectors though used either VGA/DVI/HDMI for video signals ... so would a USB link work ?	Ques
1.3.4	With regard to the WiFi reference , most of the units I have seen refer to WiFi as a connection .	St
1.3.5	Certainly if there are other ( cheaper ) options out there such as BlueTooth or USB Wireless , then I indeed would be interested in those options as well .	St
1.3.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	As to your wifi reference can you supply an example ?	Ques
1.4.2	I ca n't find any .	St
