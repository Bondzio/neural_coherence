I have a requirement to be able to Write Protect an external hardrive.
We have unclassified data that we need to move to a classifed system.
The whole purpose of write protecting is to insure that no sensitive data is inadvertantly copied to the external drive while its connected to the classified system.
We currently have 6 Maxtor 250GB drives that do not have any type of physical switch for enabling write protection, nor does their software enbable us to do that either.
Does anyone know of a procedure we could use to enable write protection on these drives?
Does anyone know of a external drive that has a physical/software means of enabling write protection?
