1.1.1	I have always had a habit of buying Kingston memory ( no particular reason ) , but I noticed that on NewEgg for instance , I can get 4GB of & quot ; OCZ Gold & quot ; for $ 250 whereas 4GB of Kingston HyperX is $ 390 .	St
1.1.2	The Kingston also has a high latency of 9 .	St
1.1.3	Basically , what am I missing about the price difference , since as far I can tell OCZ is another great memory maker ?	Ques
1.2.1	Ram makers try to differentiate themselves by the quality and speed levels they can achieve .	St
1.2.2	Thus , you 'll see the speed rating and some marketing label like & quot ; premium , gold , extreme , basic or value , etc. & quot ; put on them .	St
1.2.3	At the bottom will be good ram that meet the basic requirements and as you go from there , the ram should be more capable of speed or even OC'ing and/or heat tolerances .	St
1.2.4	Also , some gimcrackery may come into play but is suppose help in the long run , like heat shields or dispersers , LEDs , or color scheme .	St
1.2.5	The specs of the CAS/RAS should also be affected and offered as they meet those .	St
1.2.6	As for Kingston and OZ brands , they both good .	St
1.2.7	Sometimes , one brand has a sale going on to vendors and they pass on the saving .	St
1.2.8	Prices do vary from time to time .	St
1.2.9	One brand may command as they are suppose to be top offering at any given time , quality matters .	St
1.2.10	Review the specs of each brand offering and see how they stack up and choose .	St
1.2.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	kingston is so large and well-known that they do n't have to compete on price .	St
1.3.2	you 've always bought them because of their name , so the strategy obviously works .	St
1.4.1	recommended or guaranteed to work with your PC .	St
1.4.2	Often times motherboard mfgs provides a list of RAM that 's compatible with your motherboard or system .	St
1.4.3	That 's worth looking at .	St
1.4.4	If you shop at Newegg ... then read the buyer reviews ... pretty good info there too .	St
1.4.5	VAPCMD	St
