1.1.1	M4 Motherboard w/ 8x AGP and 800Mhz BUS P4 3.06Ghz 800Mhz 2 x 512 DDR266 Sapphire Radeon 256MB 9600XT 480W Thermaltech Silent Power After pretty much rebuilding my comp , I notice that for some reason that whenever the computer is doing any sort of action , the fans sort of slow down and then go back ...	St
1.1.2	I did n't pay much attention to it until I tested my system w/ 3d Mark 03 ...	St
1.1.3	It really chugged at some points ( ie , CPU testing ) , and I ended up getting only around 3000 Marks .	St
1.1.4	I checked out a similar system in the database yet with only half the ram scored 5000+ .	St
1.1.5	Is there something wrong with the processor , and if so how can I fix it ?	Ques
1.2.1	The typical fan is run from the +12V supply line .	St
1.2.2	In the PC design , this is a & quot ; bulk & quot ; power supply and will vary more than a few percent .	St
1.2.3	The human perception level of change is about 2 percent .	St
1.2.4	When the +12V current draw increases the fans may spin down some RPMs since the bulk power supply voltage can drop .	St
1.2.5	This is by design and not a performance consideration .	St
1.2.6	But new designs are going to have to be made since such variences cause support calls .	St
1.2.7	In closing , the fan variences are not to be fixed .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	But why is it scoring so low ?	Ques
1.3.2	I 'm pretty sure it should be much faster and smoother than what I 've seen so far .	St
1.4.1	I 'm a very solid hardware sort of person .	St
1.4.2	I do embedded electronics and use PCs to do some test and control .	St
1.4.3	I read your post and ca n't see any item to stick out like a sore thumb .	St
1.4.4	But how about the usual ?	Ques
1.4.5	1 .	St
1.4.6	Is the machine free from all parasites ?	Ques
1.4.7	2 .	St
1.4.8	Can you detail what 's in the machine ?	Ques
1.4.9	3 .	St
1.4.10	Is the BIOS current ?	Ques
1.4.11	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't know a whole bunch about this sort of thing but could it just be a bunch of those annoying programs that you pick up from the web ( I forgot the single word name but those programs like wildtangent ) or could you have a virus that is running on the computer and pulling down your performance .	St
1.5.2	i dont know just speaking my mind	St
