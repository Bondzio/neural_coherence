windows 98 didn't know about dvdrom drives and would report it as a cdrom except in some well installed instances.
for example, very few know how to install this old os anymore.
99% of the time, the motherboard drivers don't get installed.
beyond that, it's just a very old os that didn't know about such a drive.
if it plays a dvd with the dvd software, then it's done.
