<s> I want a new power supply, so i can play Movies and games in surround sound without it crashing on me; any ideas of power supplys </s>

<s> Looks like you got the penalty for buying a low priced system which use MicroATX power and have the video and sound etc on chips on the Mobo. </s>
<s> You may not even have a slot to plug in a decent video card. </s>
<s> Certainly don't have enough power to run a good video card. </s>
<s> The only key is the physical size of a new drive, if you have one of the really small MicroATX cases. </s>
<s> PC Power & Cooling should guarantee what you buy. </s>
