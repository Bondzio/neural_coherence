you mentioed &quot;molex&quot; which is the brand of connector and usually refers to the inside power cable as well.
if that's the case, get your hands on a &quot;y-cable&quot; and splice and dice as necessary.
if it is something more different, look at these websites:    get the part if available or something that has the part in order to slice it all together.
for a neat job, you may want &quot;shrink wrap&quot; to insulate and pretty the job up.
