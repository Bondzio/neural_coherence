I guess what you really need to do is ask yourself what you mean by expensive?
I know that expensive for me may mean something completely different for someone else.
Basically I need more information to help.
Are we talking a $600 computer that will play newly released FPSs at max level?
Or are we talking a $1500 computer?
I really don't think designing and building a computer is all that hard, just take your time and research each component thoroughly.
It's a great way to learn and there are many forums available that will help you check the compatibility of your components.
