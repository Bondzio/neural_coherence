I would use to achieve your goal is: 1) change the default password of the router (so trespassers cannot gain entrance to the router's settings). 2) change the default SSID of the router (so trespassers do not what type of router you have). 3) enable MAC filtering and allow only those MAC addresses for your wireless devices. WEP/WPA is another layer I have yet to find necessary in most home environs.

WEP and WPA do require a user to enter a password, so I think that parasite wireless users will try the many &quot;unsecured&quot; networks first. I recommend using at least one of them for homes that are in close proximity to other homes, condos, apartments, high traffic areas, etc.
