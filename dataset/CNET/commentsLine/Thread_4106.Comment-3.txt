there's nothing wrong in using 3rd party inks, but i guarantee you they're not the same as oem inks.
all you can do is buy the &quot;similar&quot; type of ink as used by the oem, like water based or alcohol, etc.
and hopefully get some good results.
the chemical make-up of ink will vary as it has to be in order to be slightly different to oem or those suppliers get sued.
even, if you get the best 3rd party ink, the results can vary overtime plus as you noted the wear&tear of the old ink cart/prthead.. for plain text, it hardly matters but the most difference is foiund in graphic output or archival desired levels.
on top of all this, is the paper media being used.
for absolute best results paper&ink supplied by the oem will give outstanding output.
if the match for 3rd ink and/or paper isn't meant expect varying results.
so after all this what are you going to do, i say, just pick a refill vendor you can trust/enjoy and your results prove well enough for you.
good luck -----willy
