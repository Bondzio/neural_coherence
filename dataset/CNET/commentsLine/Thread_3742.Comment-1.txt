speed touch 10/100 adsl modem zyxel prestige 600 series router lucent cell pipe zyxel zywall internet security gateway this wireless system defaults to the standard hard wire adsl line with telenor of norway nearly all the time.
when i reset the routers everything on the wireless system works for a while then.....falls to default again.
the 2 office locations are about 100 meters from each other.
one of the wireless routers is located midway between both offices and still we fall to defaults with the hard wire.
a civil engineer said we may be in a &quot;faraday cage&quot; and that might be causing our reception problems.
any recommendations ??
thanks,
