These waves can also be seen while using some application like Wod or Excel. There is no electronic device, speakers etc near the monitor. The frequency of the waves changes whenever I change the following setting. Right clik on desktop-Properties-setting-advanced- Adapter-refresh rate. If I keep the refresh rate between 60-85Hz the frequency is more. If I select Default adapter setting then the frequency is less. Even if I connect some other moniter on my PC the same problem occurs. Which proves that this is not the problem with the moniter. Can somebody guide me as to what could be the problem & what's the solution.
