<s> This morning I booted up my PC and the keyboard, mouse, wi-fi and sound card do not work. </s>
<s> I have checked the BIOS and all USB functioning is correct. </s>
<s> When I load my windows recovery disk both my keyboard and mouse work. </s>
<s> So there is no hardware problem. </s>
<s> I have run start up repair many times with no success. </s>
<s> Win7 will boot to desktop, but all devices fail. </s>
<s> I have renamed my c:/windows/info to ink bak, and replaced it with an info folder from my wife's working PC. </s>
<s> This did not work. </s>
<s> Please help me </s>
<s> Why isn't the usual System Restore to a prior date an option and choice? </s>

<s> devices ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Hi and thank you for your help. </s>
<s> Windows has very unhelpfully deleted all my system restore points. </s>
<s> Even tho I gave system protection 25% of my 1Tb hard drive to use it still deleted the restore points. </s>
<s> I even kept back up restores on another hard drive, which have also been removed by Win7. </s>
<s> No devices connected to the computer work. </s>
<s> All the USBs are dead as is the wi-fi and the sound card. </s>
<s> There is no way for me to access the device manager even tho Win7 has booted up. </s>
<s> I have tried to boot in Safe Mode but just the same, no mouse or keyboard. </s>
<s> Both the mouse and the keyboard work and are recognised when the Windows DVD boots into recovery. </s>
<s> BIOS recognises the keyboard and the mouse and they both light up before windows starts. </s>
<s> Imediately after the BIOS check finishes and Win7 begins to boot, both are deactivated. </s>
<s> Apologies for the bad typing in my original post. </s>
<s> I was usinjg my Xoom which has a handy spellchecker. </s>
<s> The files I renamed and coped were the c:\Windows\Inf </s>
<s> Does SAFE MODE work? </s>
<s> Hi R Profitt Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I can start in Safe Mode but Win7 has the same problem and disables the mouse and keyboard so that I cannot achieve anything. </s>
<s> I'd thought of editing the registry in safe mode to see if that would have helped but I cannot. </s>
<s> I've also tested all the USB slots when Win7 boots and they're all dead. </s>
<s> No matter which ones I plug my keyboard and mouse in to they do not work. </s>
<s> Interestingly the CD/DVD drive seems to be recognized in this state. </s>
<s> If I put a disc in I get the normal pop-up with the options to open and examine the files. </s>
<s> This all seemed to happen yesterday after I tried to jailbreak my iphone. </s>
<s> I'm sure this is a coincidence as I continued the process with my wife's PC and succeeded. </s>
<s> More work than a startup repair, but it should help. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Hi Kees and thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I was dreading that due to the info on the Hard Drive. </s>
<s> So what I've done it to order a new Hard Drive from Amazong (a cost of &#163;50 thanks to Windows 7's failure). </s>
<s> I'll do a clean install onto that and use the current one as storage. </s>
