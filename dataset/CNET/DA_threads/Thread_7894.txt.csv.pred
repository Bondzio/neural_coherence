1.1.1	http : //calypsolcd.com/CLP-19LM1.php Recently I purchased this LCD monitor from bestbuy due to some sale going on .	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if this has HDCP support since the website says nothing and neither does google ( I can only assume for now that either it does n't or this brand is bad ) .	St
1.1.3	As mentioned in my previous topic , I plan to hook my ps3 slim to a lcd monitor , either this or my acer x203W but I have to confirm that either one of these has HDCP support for PS3 slim .	St
1.1.4	Thanks in advance for the anticipated help .	St
1.2.1	The standard dictates that if they label it HDMI ( it 's a trademark or copyright thing ) it must have HDCP .	St
1.2.2	If it does n't then they are not allowed to put HDMI on the port name .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I see , um thanks for the reply .	Polite
1.3.2	IDK if using the & quot ; answer this & quot ; feature is right but Im new here so very confusing lol .	St
1.3.3	Anyway , the calpyso did not say anything about hdcp or not , so does this mean that by not saying so I can assume it does n't ?	Ques
1.4.1	& quot ; VGA ( WXGA ) , DVI-D & quot ; and being a PC display means it is unlikely to have HDCP .	St
1.4.2	HDCP costs a buck for the license and chip so there is no reason for it on PC displays until recently .	St
1.4.3	I missed if you used their support or contact on that web page .	St
1.4.4	An old reply noted similar at & quot ; Best Answer - Chosen by Asker The manufacturer 's page does n't say in its specifications if it supports HDCP or not .	St
1.4.5	Googling reveals nothing on the subject either .	St
1.4.6	I 'd suggest sending the company an email ( click on & quot ; support & quot ; on that page you linked to ) and ask them .	St
1.4.7	That monitor , if it does support HDCP , can only display 720p .	St
1.4.8	It will NOT display 1080 resolutions -- That requires a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution. & quot ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/forum/60341-3-which-hdcp is oddly the same as your question .	St
1.4.9	Another discussion at http : //forum.ncixus.com/forums/ ? mode=showthread & amp ; forum=102 & amp ; threadid=2356826 & amp ; pagenumber=1 & amp ; msgcount=4 & amp ; subpage=1 I wonder if you 've asked this before ?	Ques
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for replying , but those are all me .	St
1.5.2	As you can see all accounts registered from this to those websites are at different times , with about a year of difference between registration so I was changing between aliases .	St
1.5.3	I asked the exact same question ( reworded a bit ) on like 5 sites , so all the answers were replied to me and Ive seen them all , but the assumption that hdcp isnt supported doesnt really convince me as I live on a tight budget as an ubi student and I cant afford to go buy another lcd .	St
1.5.4	Thats why my second question ( you 've replied to my other thread , thanks ) , was that can I use acer x203W instead of this for ps3 gaming ?	Ques
1.5.5	1080p or 720p doesnt matter , I just want to be able to play ; D	St
1.6.1	Since you have all these , rather than ask , why not try ?	Ques
1.7.1	Oh I apologize for not being clear in my original post .	St
1.7.2	In other forums however , I stated that I am planning on purchasing the ps3 slim so I ca n't test it right now .	St
1.7.3	Also its the summer break for all Canadian UNis so I am at home instead of at my uni , and since uni is in another province , I am temporarily keeping everything in a friends house thats why I have no access to any of these .	St
1.7.4	I do apologize for confusing you or whoever that may decide to post too , but as of now I am just gathering information and I need confirmation from more than 1 source .	St
1.7.5	However , thanks alot for helping out .	Polite
1.7.6	I had the feeling that Calypso LCD was junk too so I will stick to using the acer x203W .	St
1.8.1	Ok Idk how to edit my post ... anyway , you pointed out vga , dvi-d = no hdcp , is that referring mainly to the vga part ?	Ques
1.8.2	Since acer specifications for acer x203w states that it has dvi-d too but is hdcp lol , kinda newbie here so really confused .	St
1.8.3	Also , this monitor is n't too old , I got it last october or so .	St
1.8.4	In fact the acer x203W is the older one so I kinda wonder why calypso didnt implement it in their monitors .	St
1.8.5	Ive also emailed company but have no responses yet .	St
1.9.1	http : //support.acer.com/acerpanam/monitor/0000/Acer/X203/X203sp2.shtml tells you which has HDCP .	St
1.9.2	Now sure why you would have to ask anyplace else but many folk need confirmation .	St
1.9.3	My advice is to not buy any monitor that has you unsure and the seller wo n't work with you .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Hi thanks again , sorry for late reply .	Polite
1.10.2	Um I always find it better to have double or triple confirmation because this whole process will be costy , with the console , dvi-d adaptor , and the games .	St
1.10.3	And yeah , thanks for that advice , probably wo n't be buying anymore in the future as I already have one thats HDCP now .	Polite
1.10.4	Thanks once again .	St
1.10.5	Is there a way to mark this as solved ?	Ques
1.11.1	Hope all this helps and just a last comment from me .	St
1.11.2	My kid has the PS3 & amp ; 360 .	St
1.11.3	Both seem to work best with 1080p on HDMI connections to 1080p displays .	St
1.11.4	Some folk continue to try other displays and write very strange posts .	St
1.11.5	Here , the games just work fine .	St
1.11.6	Bob	St
