-output of new power supply...maybe not enough to support all your drives and the new graphics card -graphics card power connector....is there one?
-cooling...does your card require a better cooling system?
-monitor...if it's a flatscreen, it should have a built-in powersaving function with a 'screensaver'.
if that displays correctly when disconnected from the card, but nothing shows up on your screen when plugged into the card, it could be one of two things.
either the graphics card isn't sending a signal to your monitor, or it's sending a different type of signal.
make sure your monitor is set to digital if you're using dvi, or analog if you're using vga.
