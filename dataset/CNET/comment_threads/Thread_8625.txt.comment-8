Basically youre saying dont debate the issue just get the hardware and shut up because if we owned the hardware then we wouldnt debate whether or not we should get it, we would be there with you Bob.
I use Windows 7 x64 but only have dual core so I aint quite there am I?
Its nice you enjoyed the rhetoric back then and it was fun for you to sit back and enjoy the ride but now youre a moderator on a tech support site and should realise that the people that write in are looking for advice before they spend their hard earned cash and most of them dont own, use or write software on such machines because they need advice whether to buy such machines or not.
This isnt the first time youve looked down on people that write in asking for help, I remember your previous replies to me.
