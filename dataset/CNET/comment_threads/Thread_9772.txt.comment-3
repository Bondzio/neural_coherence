I saw some good review on it so it caught my attention.
http://www.futuremark.com/news/60791_amd_trinity_a-series_apu_launched/ I read around the APU A10, and yesterday I been searching around for computer and I have found this one called ARCTIC MC101 having the A10.
Looking good and the other feature are matching to what I m looking for...I might go for that... Bob, what you mean when you say what happens next ?
