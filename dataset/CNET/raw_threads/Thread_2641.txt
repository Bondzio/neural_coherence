9794	0	93153	1052113	NR	qwondre	3/18/05 12:34 AM	1.11110604E12	UPS	Hi, Ive been trying to get a network up and running, in fits and starts, and the question that I have pressing at this point is: what do I need for a UPS? I ran Cat6 to three bedrooms, dining room, and living room, Ive got my cable modem, telephone adapter, router and switch in my basement laundry room. At this point I have two machines running XP Pro, one in the dining room and one in a bedroom, with a Linux machine in the living room that Im trying to learn a little bit from. I got gigibit cards in all three, but they are not yet on speaking terms with each other. ANYWAY... Im thinking that I need a UPS, or maybe two? I would like to have the equipment in the laundry room on one, at least the telephone adapter, but to have at least one computer on a UPS, wouldnt I need to have another one at a computer's location? And Im thinking if I need two, I dont need the highest volt-amp or wattage rating, just enough for what Im running? Thanks, any thoughts would be helpful!

9794	2	93153	1052785	1052123	qwondre	3/18/05 7:05 AM	1.1111295E12	Sorry	Well my question though a little hidden, is there. In case of power loss, I should have one at my phone adapter, correct? I should also have one at any computer that I have in operation? Do I need to go a more expensive high-end model, high va or go with a less expensive lower end one, and buy more than one model? What brands are the best? I described my setup to show what my situation is. Thank you
