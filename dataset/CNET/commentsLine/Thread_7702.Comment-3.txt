well maybe if i tell you why i want to do this it might help.
win98 drive has problems and i do not have any of the software because i bought it second had.
winme ran fine and i have all of the software from when i purchased it.
the winme does not have any burners but the win98 does.
so i thought if i took the winme drive and put it in the tower of the win98 i could boot from the winme and use the win98 as extra storage.
but i do not kown how to get it to boot from the d (winme) instead of the c (win98).
i think you might undersand now why i am trying to do this.
