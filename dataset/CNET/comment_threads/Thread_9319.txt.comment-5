While we have many HP printers at the office at home I used the HP k550 until it's heads gave out.
Another moderator gave a nod to the Canon MX870 and what a beast.
The really good thing about it is their software really works nicely with Windows 7 64 bit where the new HP all-in-ones failed to connect.
I was surprised that HP had missed but with a recent HP laptop support failure I think HP has lost me.
