you have things plugged wrong.
a washing machine?
that should be on a wall plug on a different circuit than your electronics if possible.
the tv, stereo, etc should be on the surge-only side.
the pc and anything that will lose data or be harmed by suddenly being shut off should be on one of the battery-protected plugs.
if you do this and still have the same problem, i would say you may have a battery that's not taking a charge.
