usb/usb2 was never designed to be for mass storage!
yes, it can do it, but does not mean it is safe!
best is firewire and esata,if you computer does not have, it is easy to add!!
usb3 is good to, because that one _can_ handle mass storage.
despite the &quot;usb&quot; name, it is actually far better then usb2.
problem is, your compter will not have it, and it will be expensive.
