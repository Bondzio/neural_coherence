1.1.1	OK here it goes, I got a GIGABYTE GA-8IP775-G MOBO I also have Two Western Digital HD's (WD1600JD) these are 160 GB Sata Drives, plugged into my MOBOs Sata 0 and Sata 1 ports, my question is I believed my MOBO to support Sata Raid how ever now I am thinking I may have a to have a seperate Raid Controller card of some sort can, because when I access the gigabyte gigaraid utility it does not show an available controller on the screen when I try to &quot;refresh&quot; the detection button it just fualts and closes out, can some body steer me in the right direction I want to set up a Raid 0.

1.1.2	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	their motherboards RAID function is achieved by loading drivers through a floppy disk created from the boards install disk.	St
1.2.2	A tap of the F5 key during the Windows install program will prompt you to install those drivers.	St
1.2.3	A check of the mainboard's manual will tell the truth.	Sug
