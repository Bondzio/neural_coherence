First thing is to get that Norton Goback off of there.
lol I love Symantec, I'm an authorized reseller, I swear by them, but that Goback was bad from day one.
Are you running XP?
Goback is particularly bad with xp, especially after sp1.
Regardless, I'd need oodles of more info to even begin to TS a freeze problem like that.
Like, anti spyware installed?
any new software installed recently?
For that matter have you changed anything recently?
