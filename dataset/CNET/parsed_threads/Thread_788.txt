<s> What do I delete in the registry to move a drive from one chipset to another? </s>
<s> I remember an old Computer Shopper magazine had the answer to this, but I am unable to find/remember what that was TIA </s>
<s> It's far from that easy. </s>
<s> And varies with the OS in question. </s>

<s> Similar to the roll-back feature, but not exactly. </s>
<s> The machine is a 815e chipset and I need it to go into a system with a 440bx chipset. </s>
<s> The Intel chipsets of that age are almost &quot;native&quot; to XP. </s>

<s> To really feel the issue, just try this from some Via chipset to some of the newer Sis or Nvidia chipsets. </s>
<s> Truly not for the timid. </s>
