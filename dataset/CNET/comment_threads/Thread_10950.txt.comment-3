it is impossible for me to run an ethernet cable all across the house, I think this is exactly what I need.
The $50 adapter would suffice for me but do you if this whole setup would work?
I.e.
HDTV signal to computer via network, connect the adapter to the TV/stereo system itself?
Thanks for your input.
