<s> Just received my new Deminsion 5100. </s>
<s> Everything set-up just fine (or so I thought. </s>
<s> Hopped out to the inet and the entire system shut down. </s>
<s> Power off then power on produced nothing. </s>
<s> I disconnected everything - powered off and then on - nothing. </s>
<s> Receiving power, fans working and that's it. </s>
<s> The dvd writer doesn't seem to be receiving power however. </s>
<s> I've called Dell and am waiting on a fix. </s>
<s> Thought someone here might shed some insight. </s>
<s> Could there a be a relationship with the dvd burner? </s>
<s> Since it's under warranty, it's best to let Dell repair or replace it. </s>
<s> would be waiting on the phone for an answer if it's a new machine. </s>
<s> Either that or getting a RMA#. </s>
