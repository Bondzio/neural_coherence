Well, as I've said, I CAN easily back it up - I just need to copy the files over to C. That's a backup, yes?
I don't want/need to reformat C, it's NTFS already.
So really I'm not taking any risks.
I'll certainly make a backup before messing around with my external.
OK?
Thankyou for your advice.
You are right about my irresponsibility regarding the drive.
