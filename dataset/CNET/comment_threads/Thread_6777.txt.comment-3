Thanks for responding Bob.
I'm not sure about the process you have described.
Is duplication an option when I use Disk Warrior?
Or can I duplicate the drive from my laptop somehow?
With regards to the housing, are you suggesting the current housing could be the problem as opposed to a data corruption problem?
I have never seen inside one of these so I have no idea as to what it looks like, let alone how it works.
