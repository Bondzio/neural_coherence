well in order to do that you would have to be able to view the workgroup computers right.
(i think) well thats when i get the error message.
it comes up when i click &quot;view workgroup computers.&quot; i came home and i did what you have just explained wheere your click on the name and click on properties so i think i know what your saying.
i am going over to their house tomorrow to look at it again
