I really need to upgrade my RAM, but its the area giving me the most trouble. I'm currently running a eVGA, nForce 680i SLI 775 T1, LGA775, nForce 680i SLI, 1333MHz FSB, DDR2-1200 8GB /4, PCIe x16 SLI /2, SATA 3Gb/s RAID 0+1 /6, HDA, GbLAN /2, FW, ATX motherboard, with Windows XP Home, and I'm unsure as to what the best RAM choice would be that is compatible with this. I know I have a 4G limit at DDR2-1200 speed, but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know. I'm also running a GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB RAM, that I am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with SLI, what do you guys think would be the better option? Thanks a lot everyone.

If you're running XP Home, your limit will be around 3.5 GB and any more will either be ignored or will cause trouble. What I'd do is head to Crucial memory and input your motherboard make &amp; model number. It's doubtful you'll notice any improvement above 2 GB but don't get more than 4 GB.

Though, the heat tolerate or those offered with &quot;heatsinks, etc.&quot; will be better to get, if gaming or demanding situations isn't your bag then typical high grade ram will suffice. If that's the reason for your query, then look for the various ram offering that suggest they're capable. Most ram vendors, offer some tier-level of ram tolerances, etc., suggesting they do better than the entry level as in &quot;cheaper&quot; or bargain type. Common sense will dictate to you what to get or desire. If getting a whole kit or re-install of ram, then be sure they match or come similar to what you have for best install. If you like to consider upgrading the OS to win7 at 64-bit, you'll may like the added ram and new win7 as it seems your present PC supports it. Though, you can use the Win7 adviser from MS to test that, just a thought. Alas, as a parting thought as well, have you checked the bios updates. it *may* provide for better ram handling abilities if so directed. Not increase ram but how it handles ram or your mtrbd. per se. &lt;div&gt; tada -----Willy &lt;/div&gt;
