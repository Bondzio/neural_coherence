When attempting to install windows XP on a recently built computer, i get the message that the hard disk and BIOS are not installed.
I can access the BIOS without any problem, but how do i tell if the HDD is installed properly?
The HDD is connected and powered on, so why is it not recognized by windows?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
