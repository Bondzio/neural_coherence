1.1.1	Which is better ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have spoken with Dell and HP and they say the Intel has a dual core with 3.2 gig and AMD they say only goes up to 2.6 .	St
1.1.3	They also say that AMD is still comparable in speed because the cache is built into the processor .	St
1.1.4	I am going to have a computer built and I am not sure which processors to go with .	St
1.1.5	I will be using my computer for gaming mostly .	St
1.2.1	Compare them .	St
1.2.2	Google : TomsHardware.com CPU charts Looks like the Athlon 64 X2 4800+ has better gaming scores than the Pentium D 950 ; however , there is a price difference .	St
1.2.3	Do you have a price range for the CPU ?	Ques
1.2.4	Are you looking to compare particular models ?	Ques
1.3.1	they both seemed to be priced pretty close to each other .	St
1.3.2	I wanted to know which can handle the most during gaming , and is the fastest .	St
1.4.1	I think you are referring to total system price and not just the CPU price if you were building it yourself .	St
1.4.2	Of the two I mentioned earlier , the AMD CPU costs about twice as much as the Intel CPU .	St
1.4.3	Care to share any details on the systems ?	Ques
1.4.4	System model name CPU model Video card model Amount of RAM HINT : Nobody can tell you which is the ''fastest '' for gaming until you tell us the specific CPU model name .	St
1.4.5	AMD and Intel make MANY dual core processors .	St
1.4.6	HINT HINT : Video card model usually has more to say about how good a gaming machine it will be .	St
1.5.1	If so then check out the Intel Core Duo Extreme Edition while for AMD look at the Athlon FX .	St
1.5.2	If though you do have a bit of a budget then that can be ratcheted down to just the Core Duo for Intel and Athlon 64 X2 for AMD that can also be pretty good .	St
1.5.3	Another factor is to look at the requirements for the games you want to play on it .	St
1.5.4	What kind of requirements do they have and do you want to do any overclocking on this system ?	Ques
1.5.5	Regards , JB	St
