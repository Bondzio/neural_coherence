1.1.1	I have a Gateway GT5622 and I am planning on setting up a home network and using the desktop as a file server/media streamer .	St
1.1.2	I have a realtek ethernet attached to the motherboard .	St
1.1.3	According to the specs on the Gateway website and on the specs for my motherboard it is 10/100 , but in my device manager it says gigabit .	St
1.1.4	How can I tell if I have gigabit or not ?	Ques
1.1.5	Would a PCI networking card give me better network performance ?	Ques
1.2.1	Do you have a Gigabit router ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is your network going to be all wired with all computers having Gigabit NIC cards and using cat5e or cat6 wire to network them .	St
1.2.3	If the answer to the above is yes , then there will be a improvement over the 10/100 setup .	St
1.2.4	The Gateway website shows your computer as having 10/100 , but the PCI Gagabit cards are pretty cheap and easy to install .	St
1.3.1	Everything is going to be wired with a gigabit router .	St
1.3.2	The reason I 'm not sure about the computer is that even though the motherboard says it only supports 10/100 , in the device manager it says I have & quot ; Realtek RTL8168B/8111B family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC ( NDIS 6.0 ) & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	I know that it is built on to the motherboard .	St
1.4.1	Just checked my sons HP computer that I know is 10/100 and it too shows Gigabit in the device manager .	St
1.4.2	I can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100 .	St
1.4.3	I can do the same on my Dell that I know is Gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0Gbps .	St
1.4.4	As I said on my previous post , PCI 10/100/1000 NIC cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play .	St
1.4.5	I would definitely go that route because you will know everything is Gigabit and no gray areas .	St
1.4.6	I believe I paid $ 22.00 or $ 23.00 for the last one I bought at Staples .	St
1.4.7	You can actually get them cheaper online , but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time .	St
1.5.1	I just checked the network status and it also shows up 100 .	St
1.5.2	That 's what I wanted to know .	St
1.6.1	Glad your question has been answered and thanks for posting back .	St
