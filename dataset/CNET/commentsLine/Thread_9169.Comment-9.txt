different designs and i haven't seen any tests between the two on the same system.
the 9500 is simply one of the very best air coolers out there as far as cpu temps go - see this comparison for more info.
again, not only is it extremely efficient at cooling the cpu, but it blows all of that hot air directly out keeping your case temps lower.
i'm sure that the cooler that you linked is great, too, but i would suspect that it falls a little short of the 9500's performance as far as cpu cooling goes.
it may, however, keep some of your other components a little cooler because of fan orientation (blowing down on the motherboard).
two things to consider, though - 1) it's very big in diameter - make sure it's not going to conflict with other components in your case, 2) you're paying an extra 20 bucks over the 7700 for an additional 400 rpms and the fata1ity name.
for my money, i obviously felt the 9500 a better choice, although i'm certain that you're not going to be disappointed with either.
