about three weeks ago i posted a problem with my hp pavillion xt853 that would not boot when powered up.
some of you suggested that i replace the battery for my bios so i did.
so far no luck, the only thing that i notice differently was the beep sequence that it gives when i first turn it on.
it starts with one beep than two consecutive beeps twice and at the and one solo beep.
(beep------beep,beep,beep-beep,beep,beep------beep) if you guys have any more suggestions i will greatly appreciate it.
thanks for your help \ freddy
