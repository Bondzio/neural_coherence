<s> Through trial and error, and the proper software, I know how to burn MP3's to CD, and burn movies to DVD. </s>
<s> But I have a JVC in dash DVD player in my car and would like to burn MP3's to DVD since the capacity is much greater. </s>
<s> I am unsure which programs I could use. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any experience or recommendations on programs that will achieve this? </s>
<s> Thanks Much, Scott. </s>
<s> The player only support mp3 on CD. </s>
<s> So just toss your up to 99 MP3 files on the DVDR and spin it. </s>

<s> I have tried this before, but it did not work on my player becasue when i burned them i had to make it a jukebox disc(??? </s>
<s> )and it would only play on my computer through windows jukebox, but it wasnt burned by Jukebox, it was a totally seperate software. </s>
