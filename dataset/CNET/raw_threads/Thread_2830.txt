I have hooked up the SATA connection and see there is another cable to attach to the back of the DVD_RW It is the same connection going to my hard drive, I assume it the power cable. My problem is this, it is too short. Can I get an extension and what is that type of cable called.

Now you need to connect a power cable. The drive itself will take a PSU cable with one of two endings: 1. 15-pin SATA power connector 2. 4-pin Molex power connector The one you need is determined by the type of power connector your DVD burner has. If you need an SATA power connector, but you only have a free 4-pin Molex connector, get an adapter cable. If you just need more length, there are extenders and y-cables that will get you there.
