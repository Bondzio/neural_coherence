1.2.1	You can download drive diagnostic programs from there .	St
1.2.2	Put them on a floppy and thjey will check the drive .	St
1.2.3	If you improved the noise by cleaning the fan before , the fan may be [ likely is ] a crappy sleeve bearinf type and the bearing is worn and the fan wobbles .	St
1.2.4	replace it with a ball bearing/dual ball bearing type .	St
1.3.1	Fans , even after cleaning can have stop/go intermit operation , replace it to be 100 % sure .	St
1.3.2	Also , thr power supply fan can be the same way , so verify its working plus *all* fans .	St
1.3.3	As for HDs , you can add any HD vendors model .	St
1.3.4	Dell , has a help guide to & quot ; upgrade & quot ; adding a 2nd HD , but use that as if installing a new replacement HD .	St
1.3.5	If the HD happens to be under warranty use that .	St
1.3.6	You can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source .	St
