I currently have an EIDE connected hard drive, but purchased a Serial ATA-300, what can I do or purchase to make this new hard drive work. Thanks for all answers.

Without a model number I can't explore if your machine had support, whether a card or converter could be used. To speed up this discussion, head to Compaq.com, find your machine and share a link to it. Bob

If no mention of any SATA ports on your system model#, then you have to buy a SATA adapter. You add either an adapter to the SATA drive itself and become EIDE capable. -OR- buy a SATA pci type card to install which adds SATA ports to install your new drive. If possible and you can return the new SATA drive for EIDE type, try that, minus any S/H costs, etc.. tada -----Willy

Will the adapter that you directed me too, support this hard drive? http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3333210&sku=TSD-1000H3&srkey=hitachi%20deskstar%207k%201000gb

2801	11	314260	2901063	2901061	R. Proffitt	11/5/08 5:21 PM	1.22590566E12	Having used such things.	The unit is configurable and many can't make them work. I've been a bit lucky with such things. It's a bit odd to try it as Slave. The unit I had only worked by it's lonesome on the primary IDE channel. That is, I set the switch, plugged it into the motherboard primary IDE channel and it worked. But then again I had to install the OS which for some is like building a moon shuttle in their garage. Here's another card I'll try next week. http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CX-VT6421A&cat=CCD I'll try it with a few configurations such as one drive, no drives in the PC which has no SATA ports, etc. So it should be fun.
