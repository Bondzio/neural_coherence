thanks a lot.
but umm, the ultra i looked at had really good reviews too.
i mean how do you know which one to pick?
but yeah, my limit is at $150 (although, i'm still willing to spend a few bucks more).
hmm.
well, i guess i'll pick an ocz power supply but do you think it would still be good if i got an gamexstream 600 watts instead?
i sort of have a budget.
i mean the gamerxstream is the same you provided below but just 100 watts less.
i don't really plan to overclock anything.
thanks for your help.
btw, can you help me look for a ide dvd burner?
i would like a fast, reliable dvd burner/player that is under $50.
