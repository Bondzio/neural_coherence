<s> Hard drives that do not spin up after the power has been supplied can be diagnosed as PCB failure. </s>
<s> Because data recovery service is very expensive, sometimes we would prefer to swap PCB ourselves. </s>
<s> Here is a guide for swapping hard drive pcb: What is Hard Drive PCB? </s>
<s> The green board on the bottom of the hard drive is known as Printed Circuit Board(PCB). </s>
<s> The main function of the PCB is to supply power to the hard drive, maintain speed and rotation of the spindle, and control all internal operations through its firmware. </s>
<s> Essentially, PCB is the brains of the hard drive that all components are heavily dependent upon. </s>
