<s> I have an AMD Athlon clocked at 1.6 GHz. </s>
<s> Now a while back my dad thought it would be a good idea to take all of the computer in the house, scrap them of there best parts and make the best pc of the best parts we had, some how this didnt work and definatly didnt work for me becuase I like to have my own pc so we evenutally put our stuff back in its rightful place... My mother board and cpu was never touched, however after all this moveing of hardware my CPU's clock speed dropped and i dont understand why it would do this?! </s>
<s> It whent from a 2.1GHz to a 1.6GHz and i do notice the difference while gameing. </s>
<s> I know my best bet would to just buy a new one and belive me i want to, however im short on cash due to all my funds goin into a car. </s>
<s> Any one now what i can do, maybe over clock it ( by the way it was over clocked before so maybe the bios was reset, i dont know ) but Im severly lacking in power when i know it used to be much faster... </s>
<s> I dont know if my processor is just slowing down, windows is reading it wrong, or something else. </s>
<s> I dont think its heating up becuase i bought a mosnter fan/heatsink for it a while back. </s>
<s> so if any one can help me that whould be great. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> The FSB setting is not proper. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Hello, You need to set the FSB in the BIOS. </s>
<s> If you give us the make & model of the motherboard & CPU we will be able to give you exact instructions. </s>
<s> Refer to the motherboard manual more details. </s>
<s> ...over chip rating and speed too. </s>
<s> CPU's do not simply &quot;slow down&quot; , because they don't suffer old ages issues!. </s>
<s> Buying another CPU isn't the answer. </s>
<s> The idea that Windows, is misreading the CPU certainly isn't the problem either. </s>
<s> An OS doesn't determine the speed of the CPU. </s>
<s> That's like saying your skin determines how fast you think! </s>
<s> All 1.6Ghz AMD Athlons are labelled in the XP2000 / XP2100 region(without more exact details I can't be any more specific), and this may be what you're remembering. </s>
<s> The fact that &quot;front side bus&quot; seemed to be a marsian term for you, likely indicates that you were not overclocking, because &quot;FSB&quot; is the most basic and easy part of overclocking. </s>
<s> If that term is an unkown to anyone who thinks they are overclocking, they simply aren't overclocked! </s>
<s> It's not impossible that a 1.6Ghz Athlon can overclock to 2.1Ghz (a relatively massive 31% overclock! </s>
<s> ), but not without doing a load of FSB tweaks, CPU jumper bridging, multiplier testing, core voltage changes, RAM adjustments, and BIOS resets trying to get there! </s>
<s> Sorry, it just seems more and more likely you're remember the CPU speed and the CPU rating, and confusing the two. </s>
<s> GeeBee. </s>
<s> i got it figured out... some how the cmos got reset, like i said, it was over clocked before, i just had to do it again . </s>
<s> however im now haveing problems with my graphics card. </s>
