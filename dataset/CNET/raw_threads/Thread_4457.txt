Since yesterday, the display has not been working. Whenever I switch on the laptop, i can only see 'static', sort of like the image old tv's would show when the signal was lost. I can hear the hard drive starting up, but there is nothing on the display...what should i do? thanks

Try this link. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=dv6000+recall Before you ask here what to do about it. The fix is to put in a new main board. I know people often want it to be a reset or reload of the OS but not this time. Bob
