All three are networked with an active hub that ties to my modem. Two of my PCs can access the internet as well as my sons XBox360. Now for my problem. The newest PC is a Compaq with Vista Home Basic OS. AMD Sempron 3600+ 894 MB RAM 32 bit operating system 120 gig HD I have not been able to get onto the internet since I plugged in the cable. However, when I run the diagnostic tests found in the Compaq Hardware Tools it says the connection is good and running at 100.00mbps I can ping the other PCs successfully I can ping the modem successfully It seems to me that I cant get passed my modem since pinging a website times out What about my modem would cause this PC to get locked out? Or is it a Vista default setting in Explorer? Please advise Thanks Jim

Is it against the policy that I didn't really read concerning what you can post?

Is your first post supposed to say &quot;what are&quot; and not &quot;why are&quot;? That is the only thing I can figure is wrong here. The router works, I just reattached it. It is a Hawking HBR 49. Now that I reattached it the hub(new) doesn't work. It is a Lynksys NH1005(new). This is how I have it set up. wall phone jack to modem, a Speedstream 4200. Modem to router. 2 original PCs are currently in router because the hub will not work from router ports. The hub is currently connected to the first port, no signal. PCs are in 2 & 3 working fine I am going to double check the cabling to make sure new cable isn't different wiring sequence.

Sorry about that. &quot;because the hub will not work from router ports.&quot; Armed with that clue I am still missing the make/model of the HUB. Some have the AUTOMDX feature, some don't. My ANSWER is that you didn't wire to the uplink port but without the make/model I can't be sure of that answer. Bob

I am reviewing the manual for the router now and will get this figured out somehow. I agree that it is a router setting or two. Some of the jargon is still 4in to me.
