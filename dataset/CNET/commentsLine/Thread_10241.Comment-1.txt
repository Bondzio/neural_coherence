i have been using my new custom built pc for a while now and it worked fine.
recently, i removed some broken sata-ide connectors and molex power from unused cd/dvd drives and hard drives, so theres just the main hard drive and dvd drive on an ide cable.
i turned the computer on, and it won't boot into bios.
i tried resetting bios, then it says _qs training failed on previous boot, reverted to lower vram speed, press f1 to resume.
(first character is cut off by edge of the screen, even if i move it to the right).
i press f1, and it says detecting master and slave ide disks which works fine, then cmos checksum bad cmos time/data not set, press f1 to enter setup.
i do this and set the time and data and everything, save changes and exit, then it reboots and wont come up with bios unless i reset it again.
any ideas how to solve this problem?
i need to sort this out fairly quickly.
i have not done any bios updates.
