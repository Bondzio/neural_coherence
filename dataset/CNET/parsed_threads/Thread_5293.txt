<s> how can you tell which motherboard or cpu would be compatible with xp when building a system for the first time. </s>
<s> is check their web site for the board and drivers listed for it. </s>
<s> Drivers will specify what OS they are for. </s>
<s> It's a good bet that, if any are for XP, the whole board is XP compatible. </s>
<s> IMHO, most new mtrbds. </s>
<s> now being offered are still going to be XP compatible. </s>
<s> The cpu will follow with the mtrbd. </s>
<s> Its going to be a problem roughly in another 2-3 yrs. </s>
<s> yet. </s>
<s> While you can certainly still make a XP based system, the current OS is Vista which will be supplanted by Win7. </s>
<s> Don't get too stuck on XP, because if you have upgrade later or move on beause of s/w issues, then your then current XP system may not be all that ready to do so. </s>
<s> Regardless, as the other poster offered, visit the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website for availability of XP drivers and such as this is a telling sign of support now and hopefully later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
