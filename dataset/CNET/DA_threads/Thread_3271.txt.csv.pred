1.1.1	Does anyone know where I can find the software and manual that came with the &quot;Anthology Solutions Yellow Machine P400T&quot; network drive?	St
1.1.2	Anthology Solutions are out of business and no longer have a website.	St
1.1.3	Any help would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	You can find this and more information at http://www.yellowmachinecommunity.org Thanks.	St

1.4.1	Finally!	St
1.4.2	I thought that I found an active link for the YellowMachine.	St
1.4.3	I knew there had to be something somewhere.	St
1.4.4	I can't believe that all of the YM sold just disappeared.	St
1.4.5	Same with all the documentation, parts, etc from the liquidation.	St
1.4.6	I was hoping to find some service documentation or internal documents.	St
1.4.7	Plus, what happened to all the techs?	St
1.4.8	They could have a good side business with the surviving YMs.	St
1.4.9	Anyway I have a problem I haven't been able to resolve, and hope you can help.	St
1.4.10	My UPS failed crashing the YM.	St
1.4.11	It's happened before but it always rebuilt itself, after all it's running raid 5.	St
1.4.12	Here are the symptoms: booting I get flashing system fault & system lights about 1/sec no connection at &quot;ip address&quot;:10000 or via YM explorer booting into recovery mode (hold mode + powering on) with pc address 172.16.1.2 running program setup (ver 3.3) YM explorer will find the mac address but never loads the code appears to be activity on the link but not sure if from pc or YM At this point I have run out of ideas on how to recover use of the machine or get data off of it.	St
1.4.13	I forgot to mention that all 4 drives appear active (lights on) but never start flashing like it's trying to rebuild the Raid array.	St
1.4.14	I did buy a spare machine just in case this one ever completely failed but that's my last ditch effort and if it worked I would still be left with a machine in limbo.	St
1.4.15	Is there a hard reset on the main board that would let me back in?	St
1.4.16	Anything you can do to help or get me in touch with someone who could, would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.4.17	Thanks, Chris Koeb cjkoeb@gmail.com	St
1.5.1	http://www.yellowmachinesupport.com/ looks to have gone away.	St
1.5.2	Some of the links still work but now it tries to sell me a great hat.	St
