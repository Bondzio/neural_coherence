i went to try and listen to a cd today and nothing happened and i looked under My Computer and my cd drives were missing.
i was searching around the device manager and got this message when i clicked on both of the cd drives.
&quot;Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device.
(Code 41)&quot; i've tried using system restore to get it back to it's previous state but it keeps saying that it couldn't restore.
i was trying to load some copies of programs yesterday and tried to use some patches and cracks on them so i think that's what might've done it.
any idea on how i could fix this?
thanks, jon
