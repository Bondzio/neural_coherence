1.1.1	I have a gforce4 nvidia ti 4200 that when i either install the drivers that came with it or d/l the drivers from nvidia's site it reboots win xp when it reaches the 33% point in the installation process.	St
1.1.2	The motherboard is an biostar M7ncd pro Any help is appreciated.	St
1.1.3	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	That's kinda strange... if you had previous versions of the drivers installed try uninstalling those first and deleting any files the uninstall may leave behind.	St
1.2.2	Then try installing again, also delete anything from your &quot;C:\Program Files\InstallShield Installation Information&quot; folder.	Sug
1.2.3	This may or may not make a difference.	St
1.2.4	If that does nothing, I guess you could try installing them in safe mode, if this works (can't remember if windows will let you do that) then it's an issue with some driver/piece of software you have running on your computer.	Sug
1.2.5	Otherwise it runs deeper, and may be a problem with the hardware itself.	St
1.2.6	Hope I've helped.	St
1.2.7	-Rhyvun	St
1.3.1	Before putting in the card try installing the Standard VGA driver first, removing any other driver then install the card and see if you can boot up successfully that way.	St
1.3.2	Then install the driver for your card.	St
