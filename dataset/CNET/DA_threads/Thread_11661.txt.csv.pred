1.1.1	I am just curious on the subject of my old dell dimension 8400 w/ a pentium 4 3.4 ghz prescott single core with hyper-threading vs. my new thinkpad with a e-350 amd processor dual core .	St
1.1.2	I know the p4 has a much faster clock speed , but the e-350 has newer microarchitecture .	St
1.1.3	which processor would be faster in playing a multi-threaded game , considering they have the same video card , ram , etc .	St
1.1.4	?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.cpubenchmark.net/ and find those CPUs to see which did better .	St
1.3.1	i found out that the e-350 has a higher rating ( 749 vs 541 ) .	St
1.3.2	wow .	Polite
1.3.3	tech has advanced so fast .	St
1.3.4	It 's hard to believe that my tiny thinkpad is faster than my giant dell 8400 .	St
1.4.1	This interested me a little more than pure speed .	St
1.4.2	There are new ratings that give us & quot ; how many Watts per megaflops ? & quot ; It 's sort of a miles per gallon for computing .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	which processor do u believe will give higher fps for playing cod4 , an first person shooter game , considering the graphic cards are equal ?	Ques
1.6.1	DOA sadly .	St
1.6.2	http : //www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php ? cpu=AMD+E-350 Why not try the COD4 demo and see how it turns out ?	Ques
1.7.1	wow .	Polite
1.7.2	cod4 indeed ran better on my amd e350 , but probably because the graphics card my e350 is paired with is far far superior to my p4 graphics card from 2004. i 'm gon na have to get a new desktop ... .	St
