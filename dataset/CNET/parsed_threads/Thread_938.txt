<s> Hey I was just wondering if tv tuner cards also work as video cards. </s>
<s> And if yes would it be possible to get another card and use it for graphics and use the other one for tv hookup? </s>
<s> Thanks Connor </s>
<s> A TV tuner card cannot act as a graphics card because it isn't one. </s>
<s> However, there are graphics and TV tuner combo cards, such as the ATI All-In-Wonder (AIW) line, which combine the two to save space and power. </s>
<s> Personally I don't like ATI and had a bad experience with their AIW line, so I go with Nvidia's offerings, but the choice is yours. </s>
<s> For your second question, yes, you can get two separate cards, one TV tuner and one graphics card, and use them together, provided you have the slots available. </s>
<s> (PCI, AGP, and/or PCIe.) </s>
<s> Each would have its own respective duties. </s>
<s> Of course there's still the AIW, which can do both and is likely to be found cheaper than purchasing the two cards individually. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> Hi I cant see a video card in a pci slot so i think my card is integrated. </s>
<s> So suppose i go buy another video card how would i turn the other one off? </s>
<s> and also what is AGP? </s>
<s> thanks connor </s>
<s> AGP is a channel for connecting graphics cards, considered a step up from PCI due to the speed. </s>
<s> PCIe, in turn, is considered a step above AGP. </s>
<s> Older systems may only have PCI slots, while newer ones will have either an AGP or PCI slot for a graphics card. </s>
<s> As to turning off the integrated graphics, it depends on your system. </s>
<s> Some will do it automatically, some require you to go into your system BIOS, and some cannot be disabled. </s>
<s> It all depends on your computer, or more specifically, your BIOS and motherboard. </s>

<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> I have detirmined that i do have a avalble PCI Express slot. </s>
<s> I am looking for a PCIe video card with pretty good graphics, TV-Out and fairly inexpensive. </s>
<s> Is this card any good http://www.sneakerscomputers.com/parts/part.cfm?Part_ID=315 Any suggestions? </s>
<s> thanks connor </s>
