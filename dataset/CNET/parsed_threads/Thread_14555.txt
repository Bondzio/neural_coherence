<s> Just build a new system but I can't hear the single beep during POST I've check the speaker polarity even changed the speaker with working one still no beep.. P4 2.4B, ECS 648FX-A, DDR 333 256MB, XP Pro SP1,PSU 350Watt,40G HDD.but anyway the system is working fine any ideas ? </s>

<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> Look in the mobo manual. </s>
<s> Does it say the bios should beep for ok post? </s>
<s> I've read the whole manual but nothing says about the OK' beep I think it's an issue for all System builder without that OK beep' first time turning the system on Thanks... </s>
<s> I have the same problem with an abit va-10. </s>
<s> runs fine, but no beep. </s>
<s> as best I can tell, it's how they built it. </s>
<s> but very aggravating of them to build it that way. </s>
<s> does it beep when you try to POST with no memory installed? </s>
<s> mine does. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> systems using PC Chips mobos. </s>
<s> They didn't beep. </s>
<s> The case that I used supplied a little device that was the speaker. </s>
<s> It had the four pin connectors with two wires. </s>
<s> The mobo shows a function for three of the four mobo pins [Vcc, common, and signal] I tried all combinations with two wires. </s>
<s> Wasn't smart enough to try it without video to see if it beeped then. </s>
<s> Seems that the Beep would be a BIOS function. </s>
<s> So pull your video card out and see if you get lots of beeps [and let us know. </s>
<s> LOL] </s>
<s> Yes it does beep without the memory intalled,are you using the same processor as mine 'P4 2.4MHZ(B)? </s>
<s> It all happens from the old board a GA-8SR533P no beep but the fan is turning no POST just a blank screen butit also beep without the memory, after checking I found that the board is toast so I replace it with this ECS-648FX-A board, does it got to do with the processor? </s>
