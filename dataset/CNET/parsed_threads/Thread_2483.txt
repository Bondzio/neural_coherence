<s> Hello everyone, I just received the external hard drive &lt;b&gt;Iomega eGo Desktop Hard Drive, USB 2.0, 1 TB &lt;/b&gt; today. </s>
<s> I am connecting this via USB to a MacBook running Mac OSX 10.4.11 with 2 GB of RAM, processor 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. </s>
<s> I began transferring a group of files from my Mac's built-in hard drive totalling about 34 gigs. </s>
<s> It was transferring fairly fast, it didn't specify the specific mb/s but it said there was about 38 minutes remaining for the transfer to be complete. </s>
<s> Then when about 12 gigs had been transferred, I opened up my Mac's bluetooth application because I wanted to transfer some unrelated files to my iphone. </s>
<s> When I started searching for available bluetooth devices, my Mac completely froze up, couldn't move the cursor, couldn't attempt to force quit any applications, and the previous flashing light on the external hard drive went completely out. </s>
<s> I waited a few minutes for it to possibly work itself out but nothing happened, so I felt the only option was to turn the comp on and off using the power switch. </s>
<s> It booted up fine, and the external hard drive seemed unharmed and the 12 or so gigs of files that had been transferred already were on the disk playing perfectly. </s>
<s> So I then started to transfer the remaining files and this time the transfer speed had dropped dramatically to about 2 m/s. </s>
<s> It now said it would take 7 hours to transfer about 23 gigs of files. </s>
<s> I went into Mac's Disk Utility program and tried to repair the drive, it said it did not need repairing. </s>
<s> So I then erased all the files on the drive hoping to reset it or something, however it is still transferring at the incredibly slow speed. </s>
<s> Is this external drive now completely damaged beyond repair because of having to shut down my computer unsafely? </s>
<s> Is there any way to get back to that initial fast transfer rate? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I hope you have some insights. </s>
<s> After trying a bunch of different things, it turns out the slow transfer speed was actually due to my Mac's hard drive, not the external one. </s>
<s> I freed up about 40 gigs of space on it and the transfer speed increased dramatically. </s>
<s> Yay. </s>
