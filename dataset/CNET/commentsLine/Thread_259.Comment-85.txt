ted: sorry it took a week to get back.
i was trying to decide what to do.
i bought a 160 gb internal hard drive from dell and am ready to install it.
(btw, i ordered it late thursday afternoon and although they said it might take a week, it arrived here friday morning.)
once it is installed, do i install windows and then other software and copy the files to it, or can i copy the files to it without an os?
i just finished reading and copying ``microsoft's windows xp home repair install step by step.''
shud i try that and if so, shud it be before or after copying all of my precious files to the 160?
(they are the newspaper articles i've written in wordperfect over the last 10 years and i use them to flesh out a story with background and history.)
and, would it be best once all the software, the os and files to make the 160 my master drive and the 120 the backup??
thanks.
i realize you may not be here for a while.
it's 11:30 a.m. here in the oldest settlement in kentucky, harrodsburg.
ann
