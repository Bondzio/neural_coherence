stlcardsfan13, have you found a means to do this?
i am interested in doing the same thing to distribute multiple text messages (for a new media art piece).
i am running a mac osx.
i am also hoping that when people respond to this text message on their mobile phones it uploads to an online blog (like twitter).
any suggestions would be great!
