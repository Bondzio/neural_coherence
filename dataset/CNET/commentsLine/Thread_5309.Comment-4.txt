okay, now i've found out that it comes up with this error every day, the first time i try to turn it on, and then if i try again about an hour later it works fine and linux tells me that the temperature is fine, and i used it for over six hours yesterday and the temperature was still fine.
so, i guess you already knew that when you said to bend the pins?
but if i do bend them, wouldn't it be unable to tell me if it stopped working for real?
