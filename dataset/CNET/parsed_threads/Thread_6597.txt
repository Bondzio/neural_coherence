<s> I had to format my C:drive several days ago, actually, I didnt want to do this. </s>
<s> My dell pc have been affected due to the virus, and after formatted the disk, my important word files have gone too. </s>
<s> I never aware that the lost files can be recovered by a data recovery software until a friend of mine said it to me. </s>
<s> I googled with data recovery, so many softwares were found: EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard, easy recovery , active, undeleted. </s>
<s> I dont know which is the best one to buy, I dont have too much money. </s>
<s> Somebody recommend EASEUS, I have gone to his website, maybe it is a cost-effective one. </s>
<s> Is there any more suggestion before I purchase EASEUSs. </s>
<s> have a free demo mode to show what the can retrieve. </s>
<s> If you decide to retrieve it, you've got to pay. </s>
<s> That's reasonable. </s>
<s> I shouldn't buy a program without knowing for sure it can find your files. </s>
<s> So better make a new selection for programs that offer such a demo mode. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> oh,I forgot telling you that i'v downloaded a demo version in their website,after runing this program,i have found the files that i want to recover in a recoverabel list. </s>
