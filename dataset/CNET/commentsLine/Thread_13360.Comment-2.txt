if you're getting a &quot;memory error&quot; then this usually means that one of your memory sticks is bad; power down your computer, unplug the power cord and pull out all the sticks, replace one by one.
meaning; put one stick in and boot your pc, if it boots fine, then power down, pull that one out (label that stick &quot;good&quot;), replace it with the next stick, and reboot again...repeat this process with all your memory sticks until you find the one that is dead (or dying).
