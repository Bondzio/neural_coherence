After installing the hardware, initially everything ran ok on a freshly installed windows XP. But as I started using the PC, updating windows etc, noticed a slight flickering of the screen on the right side. This is limited only to about 1/3rd part of the screen on the right side. The rest of the screen has no flicker. Sometime it gets worse to the point that the right side becomes completely distorted with vertical lines and bars. The side screen flicker also appears during boot start up screen (where one has the option to press Del to enter setup), and in bios, safe mode too. Some things I have tried till now.. 1) Uninstalled XP, formatted and installed Windows 7 ultimate SP1 & updated Windows 7. 2) Updated drivers for motherboard & monitor from these links, they seems latest.

LED monitor was working fine for months, the motherboard, CPU & RAM were assembled in the shop and packed up. Only thing I did was unplug the LED monitor, installed the new motherboard in the cabinet and plugged it back in.. Only issue I can remember is first time after the fresh XP install, I installed the drivers for motherboard from the manufacturer's disk provided. Then I installed drivers and Magictune utility from the Samsung CD. After installing Magictune, the PC started restarting again and again until I went into safe mode and uninstalled Magictune. Could this have started the flickering.. Please advise.
