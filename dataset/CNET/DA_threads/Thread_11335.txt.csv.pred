1.1.1	Hey everyone , I am pretty new to this and thought I would ask for suggestions/input ...	St
1.1.2	I am getting ready to buy a new computer , but they all seem to come with Windows Vista , but I really just want Windows XP .	St
1.1.3	My question is this : Can I use the Windows XP startup disc from my previous PC instead of the software that comes with the new computer ?	Ques
1.1.4	I do n't seem to think that would be a problem , I just thought that I would get input from some of you pros out there , thanks for any advice/input .	St
1.2.1	In terms of drivers which is what allows the Operating System to communicate with hardware like the graphics card that displays the output , network connections , and other devices tied to the system .	St
1.2.2	I think that would be my main concern if you tried to take a Vista machine and just install XP on it .	St
1.2.3	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	and also if the XP disc is a factory restore disc , Nope , it will not work .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	See if you can find a local computer shop that will build a computer for you .	St
1.5.2	This would allow you to specify it as an XP machine as they should be capable of handling that request rather than going into a Best Buy or Circuit City and buying off the shelf .	St
1.5.3	Regards , JB	St
