<s> I recently had my MacPro upgraded with the Airport Extreme N chip. </s>
<s> When I purchased the system I chose not to get it because I never envisioned using it on a desktop. </s>
<s> However, I recently relocated and the condo construction and location of the cable feed prevented me from using Ethernet as my connection. </s>
<s> The strength of the signal is only 1/2 of the one I get with my MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> Also, while the MacBook Pro remembers my network and automatically connects to it when I turn it on, the MacPro does not and I must either leave it in Sleep mode or enter all of the parameters for my wireless security each time I turn it on. </s>
<s> I use WPA2 and AES on a DLink DIR-655 Wireless N Router. </s>
<s> I have the SSID set to not broadcast. </s>
<s> While I was thinking that might be the problem, I don't understand why it would work on the laptop and not the desktop. </s>
<s> They are both running the latest version of Mac OS/X Leopard. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Use the settings we have found to work best in our Networking forum. </s>
<s> It's in that forum's tip or sticky at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 As to signal strength, I'm still unsure how to tell owners that the number of bars or percent is not calibrated from machine to machine or such. </s>
<s> How would you tell them that? </s>
<s> It's a dead end to look too close at that. </s>
<s> As to working here and not there, etc. </s>
<s> You are not set up with the settings we have found to work well, be secure and not cause trouble. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
