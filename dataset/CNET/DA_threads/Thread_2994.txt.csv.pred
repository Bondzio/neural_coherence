1.1.1	I just got back from the Apple store where I was told there is no solution to my problem.	St
1.1.2	Maybe someone else has dealt with this differently?	St
1.1.3	I am using a 13&quot; MacBook with OS 10.6, I think.	St
1.1.4	I run iTunes and connect it to my stereo by way of a garden variety headphone plug to twin RCA cable.	St
1.1.5	I would like to get rid of the cable, roam around my house, and send my music directly to my amp and speakers via AirPort or some other solution.	St
1.1.6	The complication is that I also want to surf the web while listening.	St
1.1.7	I currently get my internet access via theft of a neighborhood WiFi that is not secure in any way.	St
1.1.8	This connection is so reliable and so fast that I simply gave up my DSL service (and my landline!)	St
1.1.9	and rely solely on the free WiFi.	St
1.1.10	Is there any way I can send a signal to a router or some other device, while still using a neighborhood WiFi?	St
1.1.11	Hope I have made my problem and my question clear.	St
1.1.12	Many thanks, Joe	St
1.2.1	you will find no help with your problem in this forum.	St
1.2.2	P	St
