Generics give you full latitude to use whatever parts you want vs. those designed for proprietary systems.
VAPCMD PS....While all socket 775 CPUs physically fit in the LGA 775 socket, it doesn't mean they will work (at all) or if they work, work properly.
Much has to do with the motherboard and the MB BIOS and there are scores of enthusiasts who've purchased the latest MBs only to find their high-end processors won't work at all until they update the MB BIOS.
But without a CPU that the system recognizes, they can't update the BIOS so they often resort to borrowing or sometimes buying an older, cheaper processor just for the purpose of flashing the BIOS.
Once the BIOS is flashed to the newer (or newest version).. it will then recognize and work properly with the C2D or quad-core CPU.
