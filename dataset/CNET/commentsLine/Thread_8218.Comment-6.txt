the pins that put airspace between the board and the case/hold the board in place?
i believe i have 4-6 placed around for support.
my issue is that the computer itself turns on, but my screen does absolutely nothing.
i'm fairly confident that i have all the connectors where they need to be.
( i even double checked and reassembled by following the manual verbatum.)
