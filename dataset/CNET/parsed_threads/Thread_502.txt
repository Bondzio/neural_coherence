<s> Hello, I just bought a notebook with that being its processor, and now am having some serious second thoughts. </s>
<s> I know that the Celeron is for the &quot;budget&quot; users, and does not hold up too good when compared to the Pentium M. My question is, the Celeron M Processor is 1.50GHz/1MB Cache/400MHz FSB and the Pentium M Processor 730 is 1.60 GHz/2MB Cache/533MHz FSB To me it looks like its just a small difference. </s>
<s> I mean, its just a .1 difference for the # of Ghz, and 1 MB for the Cache, etc. </s>
<s> What do these numbers mean anyway? </s>
<s> Can somebody explain it relatively? </s>
<s> Would a .1 difference in Ghz be that big? </s>
<s> If it would help, I'll be using my notebook for lots of multitasking, but just between word documents, internet, playing mp3's and small videos. </s>
<s> I wont edit videos on it or anything, but will want to watch DVD's and download music. </s>
<s> And for gaming, just want to play Sims 2. </s>
<s> oops, the processor I got with my notebook being the ''Celeron M 370'' one </s>
<s> The cache and fsb is different. </s>
<s> The cache won't make much of a diff. </s>
<s> As for the fsb speed, it determines your multiplier, which determines your clock speed. </s>
<s> So 1.5 won't make much of a difference to 1.6. </s>
<s> Usually if you customize a notebook, you can upgrade to a 1.6 for little $$$. </s>
<s> The main difference is the features. </s>
<s> The 370 lacks certain features that the Pentium M comes with. </s>
<s> BTW, good luck playing sims 2, i believe you need a direct x 9.0c compatible gfx card. </s>
<s> Now the gma 900, which proabbly comes with your system supports it i think, but ppl had problems with it. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> The system that I got was the based system of the Dell Inspiron 6000, but I just upgraded the processor from the Celeron 350 to the 370. </s>
<s> Now I know I should've bought the more expensive one, but hey. </s>
<s> Alright, so what other features does the Pentium have that the Celeron doesn't? </s>
<s> There's a website called google. </s>
<s> You can search for the answer to your question there... </s>
<s> But as you've already in grief, i'll answer it for you. </s>
<s> The main difference is enhanced speedstep which is only for centrino systems (not actually confined to that as it has migrated to desktops). </s>
<s> Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology enables real-time dynamic switching of the VOLTAGE and FREQUENCY between two performance modes based on processor DEMAND. </s>
<s> This occurs by SWITCHING the system bus ratios, core operating voltage, and core processor SPEEDS without resetting the system. </s>
<s> It lets you have more battery life. </s>
<s> The Celeron M is only a cut-down Pentium M as the Celeron D is a cutdown of the Pentium 4. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Although I tried to understand that as much as I could, I generally got the idea. </s>
<s> Oh geeez, I should've just shelled out a $100 more just to get a Pentium M (you think?). </s>
<s> Alright, alright, thank you very much. </s>
