I have a cheapie homemade PC from a kit from CompUSA, it's an ASUS M2N-SLI MoBo with an AMD Phenom processor. It runs XP Pro, I use it to run older utility programs that won't run on Win7. The other day it hung up while browsing, so I had to shut down and restart. Darn thing wouldn't come back on; no lights, no fans, nothing. I replaced the ATX power supply, and at least I saw lights and fans, and the hard drive was clearly running, but it still wouldn't boot. The fan on the processor seemed to run kinda slow, but that may be normal on cool startup. I also removed all plug-in boards, including memory, to make sure there wasn't something among them that was causing an issue. No dice. So it seems my next step would be to either get a new MoBo or a new processor. But is there any way I can tell which is bad, so it won't be hit-or-miss? Thanks for any help.

Here, if possible try components elsewhere to test them. There is no easy or magic fix, as sometimes it boils down to just that, testing. Also, I've found, when tested solo or elsewhere, things work, but once put together again, it fails. Usually, it boils down to the mtrbd. and there's really no test for it other than installing all new(test items) and see if it works. It appears your PSU went out and it *may* have taken something with it. Since, you have an older system, it maybe better to think new rather than repair, build another system for costs involved maybe more bang for the buck. tada -----Willy
