The small business I work for is sending out a client letter and we need to use three different kinds of paper but we already have a collated PDF document. How can I designate different trays for X number of pages? Is there a thread I can put in the PDF document itself to tell the printer to switch trays? Does anyone have any other ideas as how I can fix this problem? The printer I have is a Toshiba eStudio 451C. The PDF document is about 20-25 pages in length. Thanks for the help it is greatly appreciated.
