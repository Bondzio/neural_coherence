I'd like to state that I don;t know very much about a computer's inner workings so...
Here's my question: I have a fairly crappy E310 with 1g RAM and 2.8 processor.
I'm trying to upgrade my graphics card, but first I've decided I need a new power supply first, which will be a 400w.
All I really want to do is play CounterStrike:Source and Quake Wars.
For about 40 bucks.
I really dont understand a lot of the specifications for these things so if you could give me some tips or card suggestions (preferably newegg.com) that'd be GREAT, thanks.
