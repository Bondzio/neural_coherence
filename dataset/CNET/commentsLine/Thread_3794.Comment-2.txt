sounds like the usual failures.
these are usually usb powered so i carry in my kit bag a usb &quot;y&quot; cable to get more power to such drives.
and it is very important on laptops to be on ac power when using such things.
for desktops be sure to try the rear usb ports (which have more power and something else i will skip discussing.)
if that fails don't panic yet.
order a new usb enclosure and move the drive to the new enclosure if you must save your files.
if you fret about the warranty then exercise that but your files won't be coming back!
