<s> I have an NEC ND-2510A Dual layer burner with a bundled OEM copy of NERO 6.3.0.5. </s>
<s> I have used both to burn mp3 music discs but I can't find any reference to burning dual layer discs. </s>
<s> Can anyoen help? </s>
<s> It's fairly simple. </s>
<s> Such menus pop up if you put in dual layer DVD media. </s>
<s> You get 9+GB reported as the disk size. </s>

<s> You say you have a Nero OEM. </s>
<s> Version sounds like it is the latest. </s>
<s> I would still go to Nero and get latest updates. </s>
<s> Might be same version(or later), but more complete. </s>
<s> Mine was. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> Thank's chaps, that solves my problem. </s>
<s> I will also try for an update. </s>
<s> NERO would not let me update from version 5 to 6 and I would think that it will not let me update an OEM version but it is worth a try. </s>
