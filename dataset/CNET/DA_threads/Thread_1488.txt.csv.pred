1.1.1	I have a slightly older laptop that has XP and I 'm thinking of upgrading to Vista Home Prem .	St
1.1.2	I ran several tests to see if my laptop is & quot ; Vista Ready & quot ; including the one from MS and they said my laptop passes in everything BUT the Nvidia site told me no because of the following : Mobile intel 845GM express chipset family ( Intel GMA950 ) Video HW Transform & Lighting Required ( do n't have ) Vertex Shader Ver Required 2.0 ( my ver is 0.0 ) I should note that MS upgrade advisor told me it was ok to move to Vista Home prem which is what i want .	St
1.1.3	Based on my intel chipset specs do you think it could run Aero i/f ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & safe=off & q=GMA+950+VISTA+AERO Sorry , I would n't count on it .	St
1.3.1	the i945gm chipset uses the gma950 and is the oldest/first intel laptop chipset that supports vista .	St
1.3.2	http : //www.intel.com/products/notebook/chipsets/945GM/945GM-overview.htm if you have gma950 graphics , then you can definitely run aero .	St
1.3.3	if the upgrade adviser says you can run aero , then you can definitely run aero .	St
1.3.4	http : //www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx	St
1.4.1	The three tests I took , NVIDIA , MS , and PCPITSTOP all told me my laptop was capable of running Vista .	St
1.4.2	That was n't the problem .	St
1.4.3	The problem is none of them told me WHICH version of Vista I could use ( except MS - see below ) .	St
1.4.4	The part I 'm angling for is support for Aero .	St
1.4.5	In my original post that portion was given to me by NVIDIA 's own Vista readiness test .	St
1.4.6	I think I had to install some plug in .	St
1.4.7	With NVIDIA being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip .	St
1.4.8	If I interpreted their results correctly it meant to me Vista ok but just use Vista Basic .	St
1.4.9	MS Upgrade Advisor however I think told me I was good for Vista Home Premium .	St
1.4.10	So I 'm getting conflicting information .	St
1.4.11	I could of course go to the store and try it out but what if Aero does n't work .	St
1.4.12	I 'm stuck with a copy of OS I ca n't give back .	St
1.4.13	Finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me http : //www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ it states in there the WDDM model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain Vista build only .	St
1.4.14	Though pixel shader is supported I do n't know if this is enough .	St
1.4.15	Pretty confused here .	St
1.4.16	Help !	St
1.5.1	you do n't have nvidia hardware in your laptop .	St
1.5.2	if the micrsoft ugprade advisor says you can run aero , you can run aero .	St
1.5.3	and i 'm typing this message on a laptop based on i945gm + gma950 running aero with vista ultimate .	St
1.5.4	download cpu-z and gpu-z if you want to find out precisely what your laptop has .	St
1.5.5	http : //www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php http : //www.techpowerup.com/downloads/SysInfo/GPU-Z/	St
1.6.1	Not all owners can find the drivers ( for this one I go to intel.com ) And a few GMA 's that should do Aero ( Microsoft said so in the test ) failed to ever show it .	St
1.6.2	No one is sure why on those cases but it was early GMA hardware that likely needed a motherboard BIOS change .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Words from you : .	St
1.7.2	slightly older laptop .	St
1.7.3	has XP .	St
1.7.4	upgrading to Vista Home Prem .	St
1.7.5	run Aero i/f .	St
1.7.6	what if Aero does n't work Is this an academic exercise or are you spending $ 100 for frustration to prove that if you got it , flaunt it ?	Ques
1.7.7	Lots of consumers buying laptops today would give an arm and leg to have XP on it and you are going the other direction ?	Ques
1.7.8	Is MS giving a better deal for Vista to W7 upgrade than XP to W7 that I do n't know about ?	Ques
