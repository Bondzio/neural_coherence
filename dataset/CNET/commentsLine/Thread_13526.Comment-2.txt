we have a few 2.0 ghz celerons that do just fine for just about all use except &quot;games&quot;.
some of the older games are fine, but the newer games seem to be a little strained or just do not perform.
that model is a bargain and isn't a slug compared to machines just a few years ago.
even 256m is passable for everyday use.
as long as you don't want to play the latest games, you should be fine.
