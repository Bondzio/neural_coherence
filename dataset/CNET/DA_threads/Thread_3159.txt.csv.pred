1.1.1	I just bought a new graphics card and memory for my Dell 8200 and I am beginning to think it may not work out .	St
1.1.2	Here is the stuff I bought : Apollo Geforce FX5500 256MB 128-bit DDR AGP 4X/8X ( 2 ) SimpleTech 128MB 184-Pin RDRAM ( 16bit ) Unbuffered PC 800 System Memory I am upgrading from a GeForce 3 Ti 200 and 256 MB RDRAM .	St
1.1.3	My questions are : Will these fit in my computer ?	Ques
1.1.4	Will my power supply handle it ( 250 Watts ) ?	Ques
1.1.5	My manual say my AGP is 4X , and the system requiremnts for the card says it requires AGP 8X , so is this incompatible , even though it says 4X/8X ?	Ques
1.1.6	I thought I had done enough research before I bought this stuff , but once I got it I got nervous and now I am not so sure .	St
1.1.7	I am upgrading with the intention of seriously cranking up my hardcore gaming experience .	St
1.1.8	Thanks to anybody who knows whats up with these old rigs .	St
1.2.1	The gfx card is compatible as i stated earlier .	St
1.2.2	THe ram , if its rambus and you bought the speed compatible with your computer and supported by dell , ( RAMBUS is usually generated for specific oem manufacturers ) should work , if not return it .	St
1.2.3	YOu power supply should be able to handle it as the fx5500 is n't a high-end card .	St
1.2.4	Consider upgrading your powersupply if the gfx card does n't work , but i managed with a pentium III , 256MB , DVD-ROM , CD-RW & lt ; 1 Hard drive , and an ATI 9200SE with just 120watts , so yours should work .	St
1.2.5	Good LUck !	St
1.2.6	Roger	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.3.2	I am going to go ahead and try all this stuff out , and will post back at that time .	St
1.3.3	One more question though , if the power supply is no good will it destroy the graphics card or simply not work ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks Again , Jennifer	St
1.4.1	simply not work .	St
1.4.2	Probably nothing will turn off as there 's not enough power .	St
1.4.3	Probably nothing will be broke .	St
1.4.4	The only worry you should have is if you have too much power and overload everything .	St
1.4.5	Roger	St
1.5.1	Alright , I 'm gon na give it a try here in the next few days .	St
1.5.2	I really appreaciate your help !	St
1.5.3	Jennifer	St
1.6.1	The Geforce 3 also has DDR memory on it ; there is no video card with RDRAM .	St
1.7.1	Thanks , but I was n't talking about the graphics card only .	St
1.7.2	I meant that I was upgrading from a 64MB GeForce 3 , and 256MB of RDRAM seperatly .	St
