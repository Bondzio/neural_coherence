amen, brother.
when i built my pc, i hadn't switched to kubuntu yet, so i did buy an xp cd (which was part of the reason i built, vista having recently taken over).
but now, i have high-quality parts that i appreciate all the time (for example, air filters that i can pop off and clean, rather than opening my case to blow out all the dust).
though i must say, you chose an ati card intentionally for use with linux?
now that they've been bought by amd, they're actually making drivers, but still, nvidia support is way better.
