I wish I could find the restore cd.
The instructions I received were much different than the ones you noted.
the ones I got lead me thru a series of bios changes plus downloading &quot;Microsoft Bus Driver&quot; and other procedures.
This was not a downgrade from Vista.
This was a reinstall of Windows XP This machine uses audio codecs, legacy drivers, and Realtek High Definition Audio.
I even went to Realtek and tried their drivers.
I guess I will try to install a audio card and see if that works.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
