i find it hard to believe that nt said &quot;we can't help.&quot; usually any it department can open a ticket with nt and get assistance.
in any case here's what i found online.
i have had this problem numerous times in the past where the installation proceeds then ends with the messages: during the installation of the device.
the system cannot find the file specified and it goes into a detection loop here is the solution: windows 2000/xp has a bug that it cannot properly detect new hardware by *.inf files, if the runonce registry key is missing for the following location: hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion this key is often used by installers to execute post-reboot programs, but sometimes they accidentally delete this key.
important: this article contains information about modifying the registry.
make sure that you understand how to backup and restore the registry, in case a problem occurs.
please read the linked microsoft knowledge base article prior to editing the registry.
go to start run and enter &quot;regedit.&quot; go to hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion with currentversion highlighted, go to the edit menu and select new key name the key runonce, leaving everything else about the key alone.
