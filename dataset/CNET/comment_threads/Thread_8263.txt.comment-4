thanks for the reply, and already went there, but no real help as I need a network drive, so went here: http://reviews.cnet.com/best-network-attached-storage/?tag=rb_content;contentNav but majority are servers.
i only need a drive, no server functions needed, and to boot, they gave the WD MyBook 1TB a poor rating.
Any other places to look or any other advice?
Now looking at a LaCie brand model Network Space 2.
Any thoughts on that one?
