I am looking to buy a laptop with three antennas capable of 450 Mbps speed.
3x3 MIMO.
The only one I know of is the Alienware 17 and 18 inch, which have the Killer 1103 wireless card pre-installed and 3 antennas.
I think the new MacBook Pro has an Intel Centrino Ultimate Wireless-N 6300.
Are there any others that anyone knows about?
There was a Dell E5210 but it is discontinued.
