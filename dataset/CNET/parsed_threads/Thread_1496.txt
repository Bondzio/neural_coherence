<s> hi guys, i've been a pc user my whole life looking to switch to mac. </s>
<s> problem is that i really like to play counter strike source, and some other older pc games that i have. </s>
<s> i know i can install windows xp to play these pc games, but i dont know much about mac hardware. </s>
<s> what kind of hardware would i need to run counter strike source good? </s>
<s> i was thinking about getting a refurbished dual core mac mini to make the switch the cheapest way possible, but it has integrated graphics. </s>
<s> is there any way to put in a video card, or do i need a whole other mac? </s>
<s> Changing out the video cards on any Mac, with the exception of the Mac Pro, is next to impossible. </s>
<s> You can configure one of the new iMacs with a better video card but cannot buy one separately. </s>
<s> If your proposed system meets the game requirements, you should be OK. </s>
<s> I have no idea what the system requirements are for this game. </s>
<s> You could always keep the PC for playing games on and use a KVM switch with your Mac Mini and PC. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> the requirements for the game are: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP (2000/XP recommended) 1.2GHz processor (2.4GHz recommended) 256MB RAM (512MB recommended) DirectX 7 compatible graphics card (DirectX 9 recommended) Mouse Keyboard Internet connection im not sure how this translates into mac hardware, or is it the same thing? </s>
<s> Your choice of Windows version Mini runs at 1.6 or 1.83 GHz Mini comes with 512MB RAM expandable to 2GB Not sure about the DirectX thing. </s>
<s> Mac's don't do DirectX but I have seen Parallels, the other method of running Windows on a Mac, cope with DirectX Mini does not come with a Keyboard or Mouse. </s>
<s> Any USB KB or Mouse will do Mini does not come with an Internet connection. </s>
<s> You supply that and the Mini will use it. </s>
<s> Seems like you are set to go. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> But it does come with built-in 10/100/1000 baseT RJ-45 for network connectivity... http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Of course the Mini has built-in ethernet. </s>
<s> System Requirements for the game include Keyboard Mouse Internet connection. </s>
<s> The mini has built-in ethernet but does NOT have an Internet connection. </s>
<s> You have to provide that, by arrangement with your Internet service provider. </s>
<s> Just because you have built-in ethernet, does not mean you have an internet connection. </s>
<s> Ditto with a wireless capability, you still have to have someone to talk to. </s>
<s> You seem to have missed the meagre attempt at levity. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> im having trouble with this. </s>
<s> the mac mini doesnt even have a video card. </s>
<s> i also dont think 2 ghz on a mac is the same thing as 2 ghz on a pc. </s>
<s> the fastest the imac goes up to is 2.33 ghz but its faster than some 3 ghz single core PCs. </s>
<s> is anyone here a pc gamer on their macs? </s>
<s> but I just wanted to be clear and point out the various ways that internet connection could be made. </s>
<s> http://www.apple.com/macmini/specs.html Just because it isn't a card in a PCI slot that is removable or replaceable does not make it anything less... </s>
<s> Extending your comment further, the Mac mini does not have a network card or an audio card either - yet it provides full support for networking (wired and wireless) and audio (including optical)... and USB and FireWire for peripheral (and additional network) connectivity. </s>
<s> Now, the video support may not be what you need to support the complex graphics of high-end games... but it certainly does support video... quite nicely. </s>
<s> As for the CPU clockspeed - call it what ever you want - but it is still a CPU cycle on an Intel CoreDuo CPU... </s>
<s> The same chip in another machine is still the same chip running at the same clockspeed. </s>
<s> Comparing different chips (CoreDuo vs single core) is not comparing the same chip. </s>
<s> You *could* just not worry about it and get a MacPro tower... </s>
<s> I wasn't aware that we had to convince you of anything. </s>
<s> All you wanted to know was if your game would play on a Mac Mini. </s>
<s> I'm also confused about your statement that the 2Ghz processors on a Mac is not the same as a 2Ghz processor on a PC. </s>
<s> This despite the fact that they are both Core 2 Duo's, are both made by Intel, and are both clocked at 2Ghz. </s>
<s> Hey, it's exactly the same chip. </s>
<s> The difference is speed, faster on a Mac, is because the OS is meaner and leaner and is written to take advantage of the 2 cores. </s>
<s> Windows is not. </s>
<s> This may be a little simplistic but, a processor with 2 cores running at 2.33GHz should really be faster than a processor with one core running at 3Ghz, Once again, you can always keep your existing PC, get a Mac and a KVM switch. </s>
<s> Use the Mac for real work and the PC for your gaming P </s>
