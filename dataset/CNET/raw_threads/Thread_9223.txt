She's taking a 4 yr old Dell Vostro 1500 laptop w/ XP and we have a 5 yr old Dell Inspiron 9300 laptop with XP. Does anyone have suggestions on reliable webcams that will run well on our laptops?

My Inspiron 9300 is a Pentium M and I'm not sure about the Vosro. Will it be compatible? Also, what if the processor speeds required are higher then what we have, will the webcamstill work?

How well it works varies on user expectations to how good the internet connect is. But those names tend to be fine. About processor speeds. The Pentium 4 clock rate and how the Centrino clock rate was lower but the Centrino still outpaced the old P4 is an old discussion. Let's say you only need to be close. Bob
