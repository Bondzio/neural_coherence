the 'best desktop' is constantly changing once you consider sales and rebates.
here's a $680 tri-core HP with 3gb ram and 640gb drive: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8773455&type=product&id=1203815923971 you'll be able to find similar systems from Gateway, Acer, and Dell.
for some reason, pc manufacturers (and retail shops) charge way to much for video cards.
so its best to add the card to the pc rather than overpay for wimpy card.
here's an $80 8600gt (before $30 rebate) that would cost $150 at retail: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130085 if you don't want to install the card yourself, order it before you buy your pc and let the shop install it for you (about $30).
