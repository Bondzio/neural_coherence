1.1.1	I am putting together a new build , ( the last one ) that consists of ASUS M2N SLI , AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000 , 2 GB DDR2 , PC6400 Crucial memory , and the ASUS EN7300GT graphics card .	St
1.1.2	At present , I have WinXP Pro/SP2 loaded on it , but wanted a system that would run Vista in the future perhaps .	St
1.1.3	My problem : The graphics card presents me with a popup message on boot , telling me I am running with only one card , and if you click the popup , it takes you to an advertisement selling more graphics cards .	St
1.1.4	There is also an icon in the taskbar that I want to get rid of , but seemingly , it only closes , not goes away .	St
1.1.5	The third problem I have is that this graphics card does not allow any adjustment of the display size .	St
1.1.6	It only allows you to move the display up/down and side/side .	St
1.1.7	This would not be a big problem except that I have three towers feeding this monitor thru a KVM switch , and the other towers have adjustments on their graphics cards .	St
1.1.8	All the towers are running at 1024x768 resolution .	St
1.1.9	ASUS response is that there is no way to get rid of the popup , that I should remove the icon in the taskbar setup , and that they do not know about any other way to adjust the display .	St
1.1.10	Any help greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.11	Hope this is n't too wordy .	St
1.2.1	But some software problem .	St
1.2.2	I take it that you ran HIJACKTHIS and investigated each entry ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Actually , it was a poor choice for me to make .	St
1.3.2	I have RMA 'd the card because it did not fit in with my other towers .	St
1.3.3	Software/drivers , even the updated ones .	St
1.3.4	The popup mentioned in the initial request was loaded from the ASUS drivers .	St
1.4.1	When I see adware like that I use HIJACKTHIS and & quot ; know & quot ; each item or head to google.com and boards to learn what each entry is .	St
1.4.2	Usually I find what can go and usually stomp the adware out .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
