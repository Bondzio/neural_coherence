Yes, I can bring up other installed programs and see some or most of the programs functions and dialog boxes; but cannot see any windows dialog boxes or any windows within the OS.
Cannot see the display property window/themes to change the &quot;theme&quot;.
Having to guess where the ok/cancel buttons are.
It's in the &quot;owners&quot; profile.
Is there a way to unload personal settings for all of the users on a windows XP Home Edition OS?
