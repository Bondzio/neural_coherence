I was trying a trial software for home networking and its a nice program, but it cannot settle for some reason me sharing files and folders.
So I decided to remove it and go along with windows xp network wizard.
BTW, I have a wirless usb adapter on laptop, which oddly, I am able to go on the internet with it via my router.
Getting back to XP networking, i ran the wizard on both computers, and only one has an ip address, the host when I do ipconfig.
The laptop comes back with: Desination host unreachable ( 4 X ).Packet 100% loss.
I disabled firewall.
just what else is there to do?
The message says check connections.
Someone told me to check Dchp i believe is the acronym..but the wizard does not give me that option...only my router does.
