<s> So I just email the people at compaq asking what's the maximum size I can upgrade my Harddrive to, and they said maximum is 60GB. </s>
<s> I just bought a 160GB Western Digital HD!! </s>
<s> I haven't opened the package yet, and in the email, compaq peeps said they have not tested harddrives bigger than 60GB. </s>
<s> Do you think I should go ahead and try to install the new hard drive?? </s>
<s> They did say my system is compatible with IDE hard drive, which is what I bought. </s>
<s> My pc is a Pentium III 750Mhz, 128Ram, Windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Most systems since 1998 have INT13 extensions support which allows drives up to 137 GB. </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com Isn't that enough space for that OS? </s>
