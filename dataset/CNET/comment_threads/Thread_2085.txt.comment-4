The way I've heard it put is, turning the computer on and off wears out the hard drive.
And keeping it on all the time wears out the hard drive.
So take your pick.
I turn mine off when I'm done.
It saves electricity.
My computers have always lasted for years.
So turn it off, but use the proper shutdown procedure to keep the system happy.
