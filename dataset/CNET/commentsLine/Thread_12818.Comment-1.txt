i am currently trying to build a computer for my daughter.
i purchased a abit nf8-v motherboard and amd sempron processor bundle, along with a western digital 40 gig hdd, a nvidia g force fx5200 video card, 512 meg kingston memory, and a 350 watt power supply.
after assembly, the memory and video card work fine, the board and processor come up, but will not recognize the hdd at all, nor will it recognize the cd rom.
any ideas or suggestions?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
