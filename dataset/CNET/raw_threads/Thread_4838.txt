I searched online to see if anyone else was experiencing a similar problem and was surprised to find so many people with the same problem. I went to Hewlett Packard's website and sure enough my monitor met all the requirements to be replaced or fixed. I called the HP Support number and was told that the extended warranty had expired September 30th,(I was 15 days too late) I find this totaly unfair! I believe that Hewlett Packard should be responsible for replacing all f1703 monitors that black out regardless. Mine didn't go bad until after the extended warranty expired, so how was I supposed to know about it. I too won't be buying anything else from Hewlett Packard. They obviously don't know how to fix their mistakes and make things right with customers.
