<s> Here is my situation. </s>
<s> Recently had my Win2k machine go bad (motherboard/processor) so I got a new machine and now I need to transfer some of the files from my old HD over to the new one. </s>
<s> The new machine is running XP SP2. </s>
<s> Will I be able to buy an enclosure and hook it up via the USB connector to my new machine and move those files over? </s>
<s> Like I mentioned before, the old HD has Windows 2000 on it. </s>
<s> I've read several threads on here concerning similar instances but haven't seen one yet that involves Win2k and XP working together like this. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I did place a Win2K drive from a tower machine into an external enclosure connected via USB and was actually able to boot from it. </s>
<s> XP was able to see the drive. </s>
<s> However, if all you wish to do is transfer a few files, it might be easier and cheaper to just temporarily connect the drive to an internal IDE port. </s>
<s> The only risk here is that XP will see the hardware change and put one checkmark against your quota before reactivation is needed. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Since I just got this new machine yesterday I would be afraid that it might void my warranty should I open the case plus I really dont want to screw up anything although I feel comfortable upgrading stuff. </s>
<s> I guess its just kinda &quot;gun shy&quot; from all the computer problems I have encountered over the past couple of weeks. </s>
<s> I actually would like to keep the internal drive in the enclosure even after transferring the files as a easy way to back up my files since this is something I have never really done very well in the past. </s>
<s> I dont particularly want to boot from the external drive but rather just have XP recognize it and allow me to move some of those files over to the new HD. </s>
<s> Would there be a problem with this? </s>
<s> If connections are proper, you should have nothing to lose. </s>
<s> I cannot think of a reason XP would damage the drive but it's been known to alter the mbr. </s>
<s> Once you transfer what you wish, you can format it for whatever use you desire. </s>
<s> When you put the drive in the enclosure, set the jumper to CS (cable select) as it will be a single drive. </s>
<s> Boot XP and then insert the USB plug. </s>
<s> XP should first detect and configure the controller and then recognize the drive and give it a drive letter. </s>
<s> It will then appear in &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> Ok, lets say I got the route of the enclosure and it does work. </s>
<s> After I transfer my files will I be able to format the drive in the enclosure or will I have to install it in a machine as a Slave or whatever to get this to work? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Well I hooked up my old HD as a slave in the new machine and just moved the files over that way. </s>
<s> Now since that part is taken care of, I need to format my old hard drive and still buy an enclosure to mount it in so I can have a good backup system in place in case of any future problems. </s>
<s> What's the simplest way to format a drive and handle this task? </s>
<s> Can it be done while in the enclosure or will I need to hook up the old HD as a slave again in the new machine to do it? </s>
<s> Change the jumper to CS (cable select) and put it in the enclosure. </s>
<s> I paid about 40 bucks each (free shipping) from New Egg for mine. </s>
<s> XP w/SP2 easily configures these. </s>
<s> Once it's given a drive letter, you can format it from Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> Right click the drive and select &quot;Format&quot;. </s>
<s> I saw some on NewEgg the other day in the mid $20's each. </s>
<s> I will probably place the order soon to get this stuff done and out of the way, I'm so tired of messing with the computer internals. </s>
<s> haha </s>
<s> Formatting right from Windows Explorer will only work if the drive has an existing partition. </s>
<s> Your Win2K has such so this will work. </s>
<s> A new unpartitioned drive (or repartioning) is handled using the disk management function found within Administrative Tools in the control panel. </s>
<s> Keep that in mind if you decide to add more externals. </s>
