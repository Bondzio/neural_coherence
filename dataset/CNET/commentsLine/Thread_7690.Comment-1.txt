for a short class i recently finished, i built a new pc.
the pc is amd, and the current ram is 256 ddr pc2700 333mhz.
can i get any pc2700 ram at 333mhz, or could there be any exceptions that wouldn't work with my motherboard?
(i don't really know that much about pc hardware... not sure what my motherboard is but my processor is a sempron).
