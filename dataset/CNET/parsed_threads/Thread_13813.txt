<s> I don't really know why or how this happened but for some reason my computer wont recognize my cd rom. </s>
<s> in my computer there is no &quot;M:\&quot; drive. </s>
<s> it coulda been because one time i was burning something and then i pressed the eject button during the process but i doubt it. </s>
<s> ive tried unplugging and plugging the drive internally and switching from master to slave and vice versa but still no luck. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
