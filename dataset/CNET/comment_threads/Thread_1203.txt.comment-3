The cfs subscription is more expensive on a SOHO unit because the SOHO is postioned more as a business class appliance (businesses are more apt to spend higher dollars than consumers).
Consider purchasing a SonicWALL TZ150.
You should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the SOHO for the first year.
The follow-on years should run you about $120 per year.
Let me know if you need additional details.
