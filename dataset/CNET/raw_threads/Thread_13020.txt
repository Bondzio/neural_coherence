Ordinate pin-1 to pin-1, striped side of HD cable???Then you need to tell the system bios, that no HD is present for the SCSI to be used, *IF* no other HD is present, otherwise leave as is for the current HDs. Next, address the SCSI HD as #1 on its jumpers or what is called #1, but not #0, if it has it. You will need a &quot;terminator plug&quot; to either place on the last device of the SCSI chain or on the HD itself, provided it has a place for it. Further info should be gotten from the SCSI card maker/vendor as to how to use thier device. Quatum is now owned by the Maxtor HD makers, check there and look-up your model HD. The above info is generic in terms, but it should get you in the right direction, I'm sure it a simple step overlooked. Understand also, the HD has to readidied for use once acknowleged, etc., format, OS loaded if its the primary loading HD. good luck -----Willy

Most of the Symbios SCSI cards I've seen in over 10 years were discount affairs and some never found support in today's operating systems. Your post didn't supply make and model numbers so I can't wake you up from the nightmare. Best of luck, maybe it's just jumpers or termination? Bob

From what I recall this is the Compaq SCSI card that required Compaq's drivers and not the lsilogic drivers. But you might be past that. But the part I don't get is your reference to 50 and 68 pin connections or such. The 50 pin connections tested SCSU GURUs all the time since termination is not optional. You haven't written one word about termination. Also, if this was the only drive, I use SCSI ID 0. Not 1. Is there a reason to invest more time or money into this setup? Be brutal about it with the price of some 120 GB IDE drive spotted at 50 bucks! Bob

In this one drive configuration, you MUST jumper the drive to terminate the bus at himself. Moreover you must (probably thru SCSI BIOS setup or on board jumpers) terminate the bus on the Symbios board. Then you may have a shot at it working, but technically it's an illegal configuration. Bob is probably right, however before you spend your $50 on an ide drive, consider buying a Wide SCSI controller (68 pins) (the adaptec aha2940uw is available at around that price). This plus a wide (68 pin cable) s/b all you need. The disk ID can be anywhere EXCEPT 7 since that is reserved for the controller board. If the 68-pin cable you get has more than 2 connectors, you will need a cable terminator for the last connector on the the cable, in which case drive termination s/b turned off. Benefits: legal configuration, double the bus speed of the single 8-bit card you now have, room for expansion if desired. SCSI is challenging, but rewarding. More useful for servers than PC's (in general). Usually more expensive due to a lower volume market.

If you bought a SCSI drive because you wanted the higher speed the drive provides you are not going to get it unless you spend some more money. You are going to need a WIDE SCSI 2 controller that will cost more than an IDE drive to get this drive to work at optimal speed. Do you want to run, ro do you want it to run right?
