i read a few of the hits i supplied and you can buy the manual from them for about 10 bucks.
it's my choice to share how to find such with a crafty google, but just like showing where the water is, i don't fill the water glass and hand it over.
since it's a gift, the new owner should be chided if they complain about this manual.
instead, print what's on hp's web site about this printer.
since hp.com is alive, well and i can find that printer, i leave your work to you.
