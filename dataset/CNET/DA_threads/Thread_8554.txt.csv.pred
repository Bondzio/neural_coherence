1.1.1	Hello .	St
1.1.2	I am looking to upgrade my current graphics card to one that has an HDMI port .	St
1.1.3	I have a Dell XPS 410 desktop with a 375 watt power supply .	St
1.1.4	Can anyone suggest a decent card with 1GB of memory that will work with a 375 watt supply and fit into the $ 0 - 150 range ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	Check http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-game-performance-radeon-hd-6670,2935.html FIRST In the range you find outstanding cards but I ca n't tell how many SPARE WATTS your computer has left .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	What do you need to know in order to determine how many & quot ; spare watts & quot ; I have left .	Ques
1.4.1	Here I use a Watt Meter to measure what my PC is using .	St
1.4.2	Link - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/P3-International-P4400-Electricity-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU Without it , I have to inventory the machine or find out make , model , etc .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	The THG article with the best video cards at different budget levels is an excellent source , but you should look at the July version instead of May .	St
1.5.2	Why be outdated ?	Ques
1.5.3	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2964-4.html I linked to the page recommending the GTX 560 at the $ 190 budget level .	St
1.5.4	You can purchase an excellent brand , EVGA , of this card for $ 175 , which would be an outstanding choice if your budget can stretch that far .	St
1.5.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130660 However you could also get a big bargain if you want to step back .	St
1.5.6	The next slower card on the list , which shows as & quot ; check prices & quot ; but is above the best card for $ 155 , is the GTX 460 768MB .	St
1.5.7	This card is being discontinued and replaced by the GTX 550 Ti , so few are left and they are being sold off .	St
1.5.8	I do n't normally recommend factory re-certifed cards but in this situation I will since an EVGA card is available for only $ 120 .	St
1.5.9	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130600 You might also want to visit this site for instructions on how to upgrade video cards and general graphics card information : http : //www.upgradevideocards.com/ You might also want to use this THG page that shows performance rankings for most mid-range video cards - and you might find the rest of the article informative : http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-graphics,2977-3.html Another page in that article shows power consumption for the cards .	St
1.5.10	Both cards recommended above will work find on a 375w Dell PSU as long as you have not added some power hungry devices .	St
1.6.1	As we do n't edit posts , links get stale fast .	St
1.6.2	Thanks for the new link and note about the Watts .	St

1.7.1	Hi .	St
1.7.2	I have a Dell XPS 410 desktop that came with a 768MB NVIDIA 8800 GTX .	St
1.7.3	The video card died and I replaced it with an EVGA GTX 550 Ti FPB 1 GB .	St
1.7.4	Install was very smooth and card works just fine .	St
1.7.5	The 550 Ti requires one 6-pin power connector ( 8800GTX was using 2 ) .	St
1.7.6	It has a mini-HDMI port so an adapter is needed which was not included .	St
1.7.7	Was n't sure if it was going to work at all because my power supply is only 375 Watt , but after reading that Dell underrates its power supplies I decided to give it a try - glad I did .	St
1.7.8	Performance seems better than with previous card .	St
1.7.9	( My system has a quad-core 2.4 GHz CPU , 4GB RAM , and a single hard drive . )	St
