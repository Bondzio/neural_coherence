The high wattage rating that any psu can supply can only sustain for a given time and continue to output such levels and the highest level is very short duration. Thus, I recommend to look into at least 450W or better and 500W+ is truly worth the cost. Those dual SLI cards are what is crushing the system psu, so think if the psu goes what else goes with it. You got too much invested and installed, get a higher wattage psu, its the basis of a stable system more than you think. tada -----Willy

And don't get an unknown brand, like Nefarion Cooling Solutions. Antect, Thermaltake and PC Power and Cooling.
