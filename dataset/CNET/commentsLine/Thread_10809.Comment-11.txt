i ordered one.
it arrived in a few days.
install was easy although instructions were virtually non existent.
it works good, as good as or better than much pricier voip products i have used in the past.
one word of caution: you apparently need pretty good bandwidth.
if i am down loading a large file while speaking on the phone on occasion i loose my phone connection.
all and all i am very pleased.
in my opinion it is a real bargain.
