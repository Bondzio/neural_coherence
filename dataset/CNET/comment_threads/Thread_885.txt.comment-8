The PSU has different voltages going out.
It could be that the 12 volt (fans are mostly 12 volt) rail (one rail for each voltage out) maybe working but say one of the other rails is shorted or the voltage is too low causing the CPU not to come on.
The details in the link in my first post should explain this better and as the PSU is one of the few things you can check without taking the system apart it would be good if you tested it per the link instructions.
It is a good place to start and given that you have checked some of the other hardware it would be good to take it off the list.
If you don't have a metter maybe one of your firends does.
This is a hunt for a needle in a hay stack, Good luck.
