Once you know the model number, you can enter it (or the Dell Service Tag) at support.dell.com to get the rest of the info. CPU-Z and Everest Home Edition are utilities you can download to learn your motherboard make & model number. This is all moot, IMO, because there have been so many computer developments over since 2004 that you really will want to purchase or build an entirely new system.
