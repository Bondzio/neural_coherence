1.1.1	I plan on upgrading my 4 year old Enpower Desktop and I would like to know if there is any way to copy everything from my old pc to the new pc so I can avoid having to re-install all my programs and network software .	St
1.1.2	I plan on staying with Windows XP Pro .	St
1.1.3	I have a very small business and I use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations .	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Copy the drive with something like G4U 's COPYDISK ( see google for items like this in my post ) and then look up XP REPAIR INSTALL to repair the OS .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Use AlohaBob .	St
1.2.5	Read http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & safe=off & q=alohabob+pc+relocator+ & btnG=Search Bob	St
1.3.1	But it will not move installed software .	St
1.4.1	Well , sort of but it 's not a good idea .	St
1.4.2	You could simply pull out the old hard drive and put it in the new machine and boot from that .	St
1.4.3	This will work but it 's not a good idea because your installation of XP is set up for your old machine .	St
1.4.4	XP is actually smart enough to cope with this ( barely ) , it 's pretty good at installing all the new drivers for your motherboard , etc , but the old drivers and stuff tend to hang around .	St
1.4.5	Basically you 'll end up with a wounded operating system and may have more serious problems too .	St
1.4.6	You 're really better off rebuilding the whole lot as you 'll have a more stable setup in the long run .	St
1.5.1	Not a great idea !	Polite
1.5.2	Youll have driver conflit issues , and is better to just reformat .	St
1.5.3	You COULD buy a new harddrive and have your old set as a slave or 2nd SATA driver to keep the files running at hand .	St
