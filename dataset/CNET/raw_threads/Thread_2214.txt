Previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].For help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact Dell Technical Support.&quot; This is how I tried to solve the problem: 1) Unplugged all USB devices and any other devices except the Monitor. 2) Entered CMOS & disabled &quot;Boot From USB&quot;. 3) Cleared CMOS by removing the battery & moving the &quot;Clear CMOS&quot; jumper. I did not add any new device to the PC!!! What else can I try? Please help.

Besides heat stress, a weak or poor PSU can cause restarts. However, you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure. In order to stop the re-looping of restarts, do that check the bios and &quot;disable that option&quot;. tada -----Willy
