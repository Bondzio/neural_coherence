i usually only shop at best buy since i get about 3% back via the reward zone program.
but my dad gave me a circuit city coupon so that's where i got my last machine.
the only problem i see sometimes with the in store warranties is that if the computer is relatively new the warranty company will insist that you go back to the manufacturer for support.
sometimes the manufacturer's extended plan is cheaper plus they can't exactly bounce you around to anyone else.
i don't buy pc warranties because it's cheaper and faster for me to fix the machines myself
