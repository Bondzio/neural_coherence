It is a momentary contact switch, at first contact it initiates a logic circuit on the mobo that turns the supply on. The supply has a built in delay of 100 to 500 ms to allow the voltage to get up to spec before it issues the Power OK signal. The various delays would make the second contact to be missed by the logic circuitry unless it was a few seconds later. The problem that you had with the prior computer was likely with an AT type system, where the power switch was an alternate action switch and could be activated off and on rapidly [this still should not bother a good supply [back in the old vacuum tube days it definitely caused problems.

MY PC WAS ALIVE AGAIN! bios boot, then windows, everything was back to normal again, it was strange since my pc was suppose to be broken, i heard the beeps and saw the blank screen, it was dead, but for some odd reason it was back alive again after i turn it back on. maybe ASUS mobo revive itself, but it doesn't matter, my pc is working, i bought my old hp in canada 5 years ago, and it broke 8 times within a year and the tech guys couldn't fix it so they have to gave me new parts everytime it broke. every single pc i own always breaks, no matter how careful i am it still breaks in the end, i vow not to let my new pc breaks again, that's whay i got so anxious and ask so many questions and got so worried, believe me, if your old pc breaks 8 times per year and your new one is having problems anyone would get all worried sick. well thanks for helping me out, really, many thanks.

But since you already experienced a 2nd PC to die, maybe you got &quot;bad power&quot; like in AC. I suggest if you don't already get a decent surge protector, a AC line conditioner plus a UPS unit. Getting all these will help or provide a level of performance just to be stable at least from AC surges and the like, clean power. Rememeber, cheap is cheap and as you mentioned unit was from that source of known cheap stuff, well you get the picture. replace the psu with a namebrand one and of at least 400W or better. A cheap 500W is good if its way above your power needs, heck 550W psu units are becoming common. As for the case ON switch, if its truly touchy it maybe crappy construction or even broke. Find its connection on the mtrbd. and unplug then replace with a simple monentarily contact sw. and see if the problem goes away. nother one from a broke system case(test unit) will do fine. Try that and get back with results... tada -----Willy
