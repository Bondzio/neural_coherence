Hi, I am trying to understand something about IP addresses and subnets, say I have 3 computers,,,, all attached to a switch......The first has a static IP address of 192.168.1.10 the second an IP address of 192.168.2.10 and the third an IP address of 192.168.1.11, all have the subnet set as 255.255.255.0, If I use the 192.168.1.10 machine as a master and ping the other 2 machines I have no problem getting a reply from 192.168.1.11 but I can not get a reply from 192.168.2.10, i either get host unreachable or a time out message, depending on what I enter as a gateway IP address (either 0.0.0.0 or 192.168.1.1).
Without any other hardware and without changing IP addresses, (subnets can change) is it possible for me to ping both boxes from the master and get a reply.
If not what hardware would I need to use to make this possile.
Thanks a lot,
