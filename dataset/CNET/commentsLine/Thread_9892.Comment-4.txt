in the xp installation where you must hit 'f6'(?)
to load any special drivers for sata hard disk drives.
did you try that ?
sometimes you have to create a floppy disk to load the driver.
it would really help if you provided more detail about the hard drive .

.make/model number/type(sata-pata ?)
and the motherboard mfg and model number.
keep us posted.
