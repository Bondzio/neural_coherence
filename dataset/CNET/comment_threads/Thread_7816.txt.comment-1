I recently aquired a KDS vs-195 and i can't get the darn thing to work.
When i turn it on the little display light by the power button will go from green to orange to nothing and just keep repeating that.
There is also a clicking noise when the light goes to nothing...it sounds like it's trying to do something but i just don't know what to do...hopefully someone out there knows whats wrong
