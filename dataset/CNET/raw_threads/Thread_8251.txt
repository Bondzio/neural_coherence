Since there are a lot of things that I will still need my old PC for, I have decided to keep it. What I would like to know is whether this set up will work: First of all, I would like to share files between the computers with an Ethernet cable. Then they should both be controllable with one keyboard and mouse. For that I will be using Synergy, a free program that lets you do that without special hardware. The computers will also have to work with one monitor. The monitor has both a VGA and DVI port, I was thinking that each computer could be connected to one port. (PC -&gt; VGA, Mac -&gt; DVI) Will this work? Also, if it will, is there any way to use both computers at the same time by splitting the monitor with some program?

For the keyboard and mouse I use some USB switch. But since you are going with Synergy you may not need that second part. I wonder why you don't use some remote desktop software. Ok, SPLIT SCREEN is the clue that you might want to have both computers on screen at the same time. The answer is NO. No that will not happen without some expensive hardware that costs far more than a second display. Bob
