buy now.
the most important thing to remember about aiming at a moving target is to take a shot.
the pc market will always be in flux and the next great shiny new thing will always be around the corner.
you can continue to lead it forever until its gone.
but if you had taken that shot youd probably be enjoying a feast today.
and yes the bright new shiny technologies will have their flaws, they always do.
only time in the hands of millions of consumers and hopefully feedback and fixes will improve any new toys maturity.
in your case, i'd say take that shot now.
there is nothing magical about the new processor or os that should make you wait.
they will not be an end all.
they will simply be another stepping stone in this endless flow.
whether those stepping stones will be short lived or not cannot be known until they come out and are in the hands of millions.
this is more so for the os than the cpu.
but given what you have today, i'd say its past time to make that leap.
if you do choose to wait to buy the new stuff, i'd say wait a good 6 months after the processor is released and a good 18 months after the os is released.
alternatively, you can wait until they are released to drive down the cost of todays bright new shiny toys.
i always assume that when i buy the latest and greatest i am going to essentially be a beta tester.
sometimes i want to and sometimes i don't.
if you are feeling like you want to pay through the nose for the privilege of being an unpaid beta tester for these new technologies, then by all means wait and buy the new toys when they first come out.
in this case, i dont think they offer that much for me to pay for that privilege.
id buy now, let the new stuff mature and buy later.
