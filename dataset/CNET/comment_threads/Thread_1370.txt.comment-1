Hi all.
In case my laptop is stolen and also for back-up purposes I have bought an external HDD attached by USB.
In preparing the external HDD prior to the imaging/cloning I was going to partition it in approx the same sizes as the original.
Does it matter what type of partition I use ?
The original Has a Primary and a Logical partition.
Using Win XP(home), the options seem to be Primary,Extended or Logical.
Which type or combination should I set up on my external HDD ?
Thanks.
