this is one area that i don't know anything about.
i noticed that some are ata 100, and others ata 133, then you've got sata 150. i don't have a clue as to what they mean.
i'm assuming the sata 150 is better than the two prior mentioned but that's just a guess???
i have no idea what compatibility issues (if any) come with each.
thanks for the advice on the burner... i had no idea that the dual layer disks couldn't be played on most home dvd players.
i think i want something simple anyway.
i don't need the ability to make really long dvd's.
most of them will be fairly short home movies so i'm not really even concerned about write speeds or anything.
mainly i want a decent quality burner that makes compatible dvd's.
thanks!
