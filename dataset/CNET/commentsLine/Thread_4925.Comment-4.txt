more and more programs are being written to maximize your dual-core dollar, and windows itself is going to be better at it soon (vista).
i would say out of the choices you have listed, go with the amd dual-core 3800+ over the intel.
only the newest intel chips (still cost about $1000) can compete with similarly priced amds (but it does smoke everything them all, from what i have read).
good luck!
