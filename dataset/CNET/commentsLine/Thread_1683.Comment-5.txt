though doesn't the gma3000 take from the system so it only have ~750mb of ram?
by using system memory this may not be how 3d games like to work would be another way to put this.
just because it is a new series doesn't mean it breaks the benchmarks.
if it is intended to be a budget graphics solution which i suspect it is then the answer lies in looking to see if the motherboard has a pci-e slot or possibly agp if there isn't a pci-e slot and look for a good card in that type.
generally cards from nvidia and ati are used for graphics rather than intel which is known more for cpus than anything else.
