<s> Its my first build in awhile and im looking for some help. </s>
<s> I got an asus mobo with an onboard sis 180 controller and a samsung 120gb sp1213c sata hdd. </s>
<s> i plan on it being the only hdd. </s>
<s> Anyway, i tried to have cmos autodetect the drive like the install instructions said but that failed. </s>
<s> Continued to the sata menu where it did detect the drive there. </s>
<s> However when i continued to try and install xp on the drive it said no hd was detected. </s>
<s> Thats a quick summary of where im at now and im at a loss. </s>
<s> Its been some time since doing something like this, so any help on what im forgetting is much appreciated. </s>
<s> have SATA drivers. </s>
<s> These come with the MB. </s>
<s> You need to have these available when the XP installation asks for them. </s>
<s> Early on, XP will ask if you have device drivers to pre-install. </s>
<s> You must acknowledge that you do and what the drivers are. </s>
<s> They will be on the MB software/driver disk. </s>
<s> A bit later you will need to present the disk. </s>
<s> It is usually possible to extract the necessary files to a floppy and the CD that came with the MB might allow you to make them right from it. </s>
<s> Sometimes this requires another PC. </s>
<s> It can be tricky for one who has never encountered this. </s>
<s> The same goes for RAID drivers. </s>
<s> If your MB has a RAID controller, XP will see this but not install drivers. </s>
<s> You do this yourself. </s>
<s> was talking with a friend and he said something about only needing drivers if i wanted a raid configuration. </s>
<s> since this hd will be stand alone im not gonna need a raid setup. </s>
<s> he also said the hd needeto be detected in the bios, which was my original problem. </s>
<s> I cant seem to get it to it to autodetect and i cant put it in manually either. </s>
<s> anyway thnx for the help and any more info is very much appreciated. </s>
<s> because it has the necessary internal software to do so. </s>
<s> XP needs to see the drive through the controller. </s>
<s> The drivers are for the controller. </s>
<s> Other manufactures such as Promise and VIA make SATA and RAID controllers as well and the same applies. </s>
<s> XP needs the drivers for these and other devices it does not know. </s>
<s> There is a workaround but it's tricky. </s>
<s> You can install the OS on an IDE drive and then extract the drivers easily from the MB CD. </s>
<s> Next you need to attach the SATA drive and clone it from the IDE drive. </s>
<s> Then remove the IDE drive and the SATA drive should boot. </s>
<s> XP will detect it as new hardware but, if it's a new installation, there is no worry about reactivating at this point. </s>
<s> I have done this myself. </s>
