<s> I installed a new 40GB HDD and attempted to install XP. </s>
<s> The XP CD didn't start so I changed the BIOS to load from the CD first. </s>
<s> When I restarted my monitor says no signal received and nothing works. </s>
<s> I tried a boot disk (floppy) with the same results. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Put everything back to when/where it worked. </s>

<s> During the installation of the new HD you may have dislodge the Video Card? </s>
<s> Try reseating it properly. </s>
<s> You said you were able to boot into the BIOS to change the boot sequence to CD-ROM? </s>
<s> So the screen wasn't blank right? </s>
<s> Just recheck your video card and all cables inside the PC and try again. </s>
<s> I have no idea if this makes any sense but I got it to boot into safe mode and changed the power setting from home/office to always on (which it was before) and it took off on restart...Loading XP now...Thanks for your suggestions anyway... </s>
<s> I spoke too soon. </s>
<s> XP formatted the disk, loaded the initial programs and did the first reboot. </s>
<s> There was a small amount of activity on the CD drive, the screen went blank and it been like that for 15 minutes. </s>
<s> What do I try next? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
