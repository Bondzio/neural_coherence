<s> ok here is the scoop. </s>
<s> The only version of windows xp i could get my hands on is the x64 edition. </s>
<s> Because of that, i only found one networking card that works, well sorta works. </s>
<s> Its a piece of s**t. Last week, my friend convinced me to try Linux. </s>
<s> So now i have a dual boot system. </s>
<s> So since i have a 32bit version of Linux running, i wanna throw in a D-Link wifi card that i just bought that does not work with my windows so i figure i would throw it in my computer and use it for my linux. </s>
<s> Well when i did that, i booted into windows and because i had 2 wifi cards in here, the original one didnt work. </s>
<s> I even disabled the d-link one in device manager and the working refused to find my router. </s>
<s> Is there a way this can be done? </s>
<s> Try Newegg.com and other places. </s>
<s> XP64 drivers are rare. </s>
