i right clicked on multimedia audio controller and properities.
it states there is no driver.
i searched around and the driver they are suggesting is realtek 97 and it keeps crashing my pc midway through the install causing the blue screen of death.
after i two attempts at installing it i gave it.
i also went in services, windows audio and clicked on restart and nothing.
still no audio.
i shut down and rebooted and still no sound.
i just keeps stating there is no driver for multimedia audio controller.
i downloaded the suggested one from here but for some reason it won't allow me to run it.
any suggestions.
