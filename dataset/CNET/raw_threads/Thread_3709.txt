The modem is connected to a Windows XP (Home Edition) machine and I have a Windows '98SE machine networked to the home portal via a wireless adapter. My first problem is that the '98SE machine usually will not boot up unless I unplug the wireless adapter from the USB port. The machine then boots but I immediately receive the following two Windows error messages. ------------------------------------------------------- Message one: C:\Program Files\BellSouth\WLAN Utility\SWLU.exe ------------------------------------------------------- Message two: The ADSLDPC.DLL file is linked to missing export NTDLL.DLL:RtllnitUnicodeString. ------------------------------------------------------- I have downloaded the NTDLL.DLL but am not sure if it goes is C:\Windows\System. I tried placing the file in that directory once before when I received the same error messages during a software installation and it did not solve the problem. Is the RtllnitUnicodeString part of the registry? I have run regedit and cannot find it. I would appreciate any help anyone can provide. Thanks, hwy61visitor
