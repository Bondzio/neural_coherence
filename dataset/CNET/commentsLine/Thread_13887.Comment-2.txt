ftp is the file transfer protocol.
it is one method for storing files in a central location and sharing them.
ftp servers will not show up under &quot;my neighborhood&quot;.
that is a windows workgroup thing.
personally, i prefer the ftp method.
windows file sharing is very chatty and can negatively impact wireless networks when many machines are broadcastion netbios traffic.
