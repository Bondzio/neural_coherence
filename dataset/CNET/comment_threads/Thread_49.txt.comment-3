My machine is a WTX ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTX ) But the link above hinted WTXs are backwards compatible with ATXs, so thought this means standard ATX PSU would work...
I just came across some blogs/threads which hint Dell and HP alter the wiring on the 24 pin atx of their proprietary PSUs to make standard ones incompatible...
