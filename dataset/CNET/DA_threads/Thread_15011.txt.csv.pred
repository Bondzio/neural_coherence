1.3.1	& quot ; Warning : After you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk , local access to the dynamic disk is limited to Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional .	St
1.3.2	Additionally , after you convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk , the dynamic volumes can not be changed back to partitions .	St
1.3.3	You must first delete all dynamic volumes on the disk and then convert the dynamic disk back to a basic disk .	Sug
1.3.4	If you want to keep your data , you must first back up the data or move it to another volume. & quot ; http : //www.petri.co.il/basic_vs_dynamic_disks.htm and other places .	St
