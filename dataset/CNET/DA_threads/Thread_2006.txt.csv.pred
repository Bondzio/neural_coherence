1.1.1	ok, so i updated these drivers for my nvidia video card, and in installation it said that it hadnt passed windows logo testing, and could harm the computer, and i asked someone about this and hey said not to worry about it, so i continued to install the driver.it finished, and it seemed to be working fine, but then the computer started acting weird, so i shutdown, and when i started it up again, and the message said there was keyboard failure,and i got on to the computer, and everything was normal...except of course the fact that my keyboard had stopped working, can anyone ell me if there is a way to fix this?

1.2.3	or exclamations marks in the listing.	St
1.2.4	If not, then click on the keyboard.	St
1.2.5	Right click on each of the listed keyboards to see if the new driver is listed as being used.	St
1.2.6	When you find the suspect driver, tell it to roll back the driver to the previous driver.	St
