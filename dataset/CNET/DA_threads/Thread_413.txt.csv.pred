1.1.1	I was all happy with a low cost Netgear print server until i saw it needs Windows or Vista .	St
1.1.2	What would be Mac-compatible please ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I 'd use theirs .	St
1.3.1	Using theirs would be fine .	St
1.3.2	They do n't make one .	Sug
1.3.3	We are talking about something that plugs into a parallel port and connects a printer to an ethernet network .	St
1.3.4	I had one that connected through the Appletalk port , but no longer works because of Snow Leopard .	St
1.3.5	if you know for a fact that Apple makes one , I will be as delighted as surprised .	St
1.3.6	Best , - Bill	St
1.4.1	I missed that detail in your first post .	St
1.4.2	Also , try our other Mac specific forums and especially the one with the sticky note about printing issues in the new land .	St
1.5.1	I found a post over there that referred me to Netgear , but it 's not compatible .	St
1.5.2	i 've sent Netgear a request for a tech note to see if i can configure with a PC and run on a Mac .	St
1.5.3	I ca n't think of a good reason why the OS would be a problem for an ethernet converter , but it 's probably more than that .	St
1.5.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.5.5	Best , - Bill	St
1.6.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/mac-forums/mac-os-x-forum/ ? tag=f06-fd ; StickyWin_1252268084609 One is about printing in the new land .	St
1.6.2	Sorry but I have n't seen a parallel port printer since about 1999 .	St
1.6.3	I can see why makers are not making print servers anymore .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.7.2	I 'm aware of those posts , and they do n't help at all .	St
1.7.3	I 'm still hoping someone will have an answer to the question I asked .	St
1.7.4	I did ask it for a reason and did know what i was talking about .	St
1.7.5	None of the posts come close to helping me except one on the absence of Appletalk .	St
1.7.6	i 'm not sure what the implications are , which is part of what I 'm trying to find out .	St
1.7.7	Hey , it 's an old printer from 2000 .	St
1.7.8	But it works very very well and is overkill these days when i print less than 1 % of the documents i generate .	St
1.7.9	Not about to get a new one unless i figure out that the price is close to what it will cost to get this working again .	St
1.7.10	i think the Netgear doodad will work if i can configure it with my PC , but surely there is one with Mac software .	St
1.7.11	By the way , i have run through 3 inkjet printers while this one soldiered on with no problems whatever .	St
1.7.12	Thanks for the comments .	St
1.7.13	Hope someone else will chime in though .	St
1.7.14	With all these replies , I am concerned people will figure my question was answered .	St
1.7.15	Should i repost , you think ?	Ques
1.7.16	I guess that sounds ungrateful , and i 'm not .	St
1.7.17	I 'm just frustrated .	St
1.8.1	Your top post did have an answer .	St
1.8.2	But later we discover you had other than the run of the mill printer so what we all can use do not apply to your situation .	St
1.8.3	Good luck in your search .	Polite
