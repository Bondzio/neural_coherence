1.1.1	I have a sony vaio laptop computer running windows vista home premium service pack 2. it has two physical hard drives that are identical ( toshiba mk1637gsx ) .	St
1.1.2	the primary drive is almost full .	St
1.1.3	I would like to merge the two physical drives into one without reformating my primary drive to create more space for programs .	St
1.1.4	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.5	If so please give me instructions on how to merge the drives into one .	Sug
1.1.6	Your help in this matter would be much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	No , that ca n't be done in Vista .	St
1.2.2	But you can move a great deal of the content of the c : -drive ( your Documents folder and everything it contains and the other subfolders of the rootfolder you created yourself ) to the d : -drive and start using that .	St
1.2.3	Windows and Users ( except for the Documents part ) ca n't be moved .	St
1.2.4	Program Files ca n't be moved , but you can install most ( not all ! )	St
1.2.5	programs onto the d : -drive also .	St
1.2.6	To move your Documents folder , right click and find the Move command in it 's properties .	Sug

1.3.1	I have already moved my data and documents to an external drive .	St
1.3.2	Since it is not possible with vista , is it possible with windows 7 pro ?	Ques
1.4.1	When it comes time to restore the machine they tend to recreate the same setup .	St
1.4.2	As there are TWO PHYSICAL DRIVES there is no other way than to RAID the two but unless you are comfortable with this I feel you should use the other drive for some files and keep the C drive tidy .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Certainly in Windows 7 ( and possibly in Vista also , although I 've never done it ) , you can use junction points .	St
1.5.2	Then that whole d : -drive becomes a folder in the c : -drive .	St
1.5.3	I 'll leave it to you to research the details .	St
1.5.4	Did they ever tell you that external drives are slow and unreliable ?	Ques
1.5.5	Only store documents on them if you either have a good backup or do n't mind losing them .	St
