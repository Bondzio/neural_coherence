<s> First, full disclosure: I don't yet own a tablet. </s>
<s> I really want one, but so far I've been disappointed with something about every tablet I've looked at. </s>
<s> And when it comes to Android tablets, with all their proprietary or semi-proprietary software implementations, frankly I'm so confused I could stumble across the perfect tablet and not realize it. </s>
<s> No matter what every other tablet maker has done so far, iPad is still the 800-lb. </s>
<s> gorilla of tablets. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> By now, you'd think it would have at least one strong competitor. </s>
<s> So what is Apple doing so right that no one else is doing (yet)? </s>
<s> What change would you tell the other tablet makers to make that would narrow the gap with Apple when it comes to popularity and sales? </s>
<s> What should Google do with the next version of Android? </s>
<s> Isn't the sheer number of Android versions being used a problem in itself? </s>
<s> And for iPad owners: What have you seen in other tablets that you would like to see incorporated into a future iPad? </s>
<s> I know what I think Apple left out of their iPads so far, and I have some idea of what I'd like to see in Android tablets. </s>
<s> But this isn't intended as a rant, so I'll keep mum and let you state your ideas. </s>
<s> What would you do to make a tablet that beats the iPad 2 in the marketplace? </s>
<s> As to the Apple, it's far from right as folk continue to buy one and discover it's not a laptop replacement. </s>
<s> Something is being lost in translation to the consumers. </s>
<s> As to the Android, the only confusion is that it's much like the PC industry. </s>
<s> The consumers have a very hard time wrapping their head about the concepts about that. </s>
<s> And your question about what I want to see an the iPad. </s>
<s> It's a very short list. </s>
<s> 1. microSD slot. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Support for Bluetooth SPP. </s>
<s> As you your assertion about a sales gap, that usually means you can't aggregate the total sales of Android. </s>
<s> -&gt; Both IOS and Android are on track to have 1 BILLION users in 10 years. </s>
<s> Isn't second place grand? </s>
