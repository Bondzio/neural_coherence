booted up my mom's comp and it said that one of the drives had bad sectors and recommended that i run scan disk.
after scandisk, it said that physical damage had occurred to the drive and that i should back up the files.
my mom has extremely important things on that drive so i transferred them to the secondary hard drive in my comp (no it isn't partitioned it really is a seperate drive).
now i'm just looking for a course of action.
is scandisk just giving me a bogus analysis?
any suggested course of action would be appreciated.
