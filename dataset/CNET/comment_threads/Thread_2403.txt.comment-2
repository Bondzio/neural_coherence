If it's an IDE-drive, it should be configured as Master in the IDE.
And drivers shouldn't be necessary.
Two little experiments: 1.
Find a friend, colleague or family member who has another external disk (they are quite common, nowadays).
Does that work on your PC?
2.
Find another PC.
Does your disk work on that PC.
It should.
