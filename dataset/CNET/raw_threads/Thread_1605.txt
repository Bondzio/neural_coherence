I've taken a look at some printers that have caught my eye, namely the Epson Stylus C45. I am aiming for a printer that is affordable (not enough allowance to fund expensive printers). By affordable, I mean that it has to be cheap in black ink; since it's what I use more often. Please advise my on what my next printer should be. Cheers, Carlo
