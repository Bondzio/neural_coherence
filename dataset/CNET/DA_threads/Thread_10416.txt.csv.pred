1.1.1	I have a slightly convoluted question that requires a little bit of explanation.	St
1.1.2	I'm a college student living at my parents house and I connect to the net through their wireless router and they have it set up with WPA2 (which they will not change).	St
1.1.3	I have a device that can only connect the internet through WEP enabled wi-fi networks and I've been trying some bizarre jury-rigging to get it to connect.	St
1.1.4	I have my own router (WEP) that is separate from my parents' that I have set up in my room which I mainly use as a hub for LAN parties.	St
1.1.5	So here's the question: If I plug an ethernet cable into my Mac (which wirelessly connects to the WPA router) and plug the other end into the internet port of my WEP router, then enable internet sharing from the wireless to the ethernet on my mac, would it be possible to connect to the internet wirelessly through the WEP router?	St
1.1.6	I have tried this, but I can't seem to get it to work.	St
1.1.7	I have previously connected my XBox 360 to XBox live through internet sharing from my wireless to an ethernet connection to my XBox, but I needed to change the DNS server settings on my XBox to the ones supplied by my parents' router.	St
1.1.8	So, if this is even feasible, my guess would be I need to change the DNS Settings on the device that I'm trying to connect with, but if this is the case, I don't know what I should change them to.	Sug
1.1.9	Any ideas on what to do, or is this impossible?	St
1.2.1	I should have posted the system info WPA Router: Linksys WRT110 WEP Router: Linksys WRT54G (fairly ancient, but it works) Computer: MacBook Pro running OSX 10.6.4 Device: Nintendo DS Lite	St
1.3.1	What device is this?	St
1.3.2	I will respect that is not your network and try this another way.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-DS-Wi-Fi-USB-Connector/dp/B000MXMNG4	St
1.5.1	Let's assume that I am poor and at this point I can use only the tools at my disposal to do this (which is pretty much the truth, especially with christmas coming up) Those tools are two ethernet cables, a Linksys WRT54G, a Macbook, and WPA2 protected internet connection.	St
1.6.1	The Device is a Nintendo DS Lite, so admittedly this is not the most important thing ever, but it would be nice to get it to work.	St
1.6.2	I would love to change the security settings on my parents' network but they won't let me because they're technologically illiterate and seem to regard computers and wireless routers as some kind of spooky black magic that should not be touched, lest the heathen gods become angry.	St
1.6.3	Despite showing them that I can do change the security settings safely and easily on my own router, I am not allowed to touch theirs.	St
1.7.1	It is a very bad idea to downgrade your security just to be compatible with a device that does not support WPA.	St
1.7.2	I suspect your parents know perfectly well that the change itself is easy it is the risk of running WEP they do not wish to take.	St
1.7.3	WEP can be cracked in seconds with a active attack with free software that take all the skill of clicking CRACK NOW.	St
1.7.4	Your plan should work, you need to connect a &quot;LAN&quot; port on your WEP router to the MAC.	Sug
1.7.5	I hate ICS on a PC and I assume a MAC is just as nasty.	St
1.7.6	In general the ICS device will provide the DNS entry, they set it to themselves and then proxy it to the real one.	St
1.7.7	The end device will think the ICS PC is the DNS.	St
1.7.8	If you can run a ethernet cable to the WPA router that would be the simplest connection.	St
1.7.9	If the WPA router were mine I would cut you off for compromising the security.	St
1.8.1	I am quite aware of the security risks and how bad of an idea it is to downgrade under just about every condition.	St
1.8.2	In my case however, out in the middle of pretty much no where, I think trading a fair amount of security for the freedom I want is not terribly unreasonable.	St
1.8.3	As a measure of security, I do not intend to have my router connected to my computer and therefore not connected to my parents network unless I'm using my DS online (usually to play with my cousin across the country who may or may not be dying of cancer, which is another reason the security breach is worth it).	St
1.8.4	As for my parents, they really don't know the difference between WPA or WEP, in fact I would wager that they don't even know what they are.	St
1.8.5	And if I could run some ethernet cable, I would.	St
1.8.6	They won't let me wire the house like I wanted to about five years ago and if I ran it down the stairs, around the corner, through the kitchen, through the living room, and into the dining room outside of the walls...	St
1.8.7	I think you get the point.	St
1.8.8	I really do appreciate your technical advice so I thank you for that.	Polite
1.8.9	I even understand your slightly dramatic warning, just in case I wasn't aware of the risks.	St
1.8.10	But unless you really understand why someone is asking a question and all conditionals surrounding their query, please leave snide comments like your last line out.	St
1.8.11	They serve no purpose.	St
1.8.12	Again though, thank you for the tech advice I'm sure it will prove useful.	Polite
1.9.1	I asked google this question and in the first page was http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20051119155606277 I would not have suggested this given the details in your first post.	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	This was one of the first things I did, but step 1 says to connect to the net with something other than my wireless card which is something I cannot do with my computer in my room.	St
1.11.1	For 25 bucks I use a WGPS606 (refurb) to accomplish this.	St
1.11.2	If 25 bucks is not doable then I fear you have hit the limits of what I can offer.	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	I hadn't considered of getting a repeater to free up my wireless card so I could broadcast from my computer.	St
1.12.2	Great idea and will also let me connect my xbox permanently.	St
1.12.3	I had looked into getting a something similar a few years back but they were far to expensive back then.	St
1.12.4	Thanks.	St
1.13.1	If you know what an access point is, this is what they call a client device.	St
1.13.2	One is almost the opposite or the other pair of the other.	St
1.13.3	But to call it a repeater would be incorrect as I see repeaters do something different.	St
1.13.4	But the 606 worked so well I bought a second unit.	St
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	Misread the specs on the 606, and for some reason thought it boosted the signal as well (which makes absolutely no sense for the device you suggested so I don't know what was going through my mind).	St
1.14.2	You'll have to excuse me, it's finals time and my mind is moderately frazzled.	St
1.15.1	Good luck on finals!	Polite
1.16.1	Thank you muchly, I'm gonna need it.	St
1.17.1	technicaly your solution should work, but as you mentionned that you use a WRT54G, i will suggest you to falsh it with dd-wrt or openwrt firmware then to use it as wireless repeater.	Sug
1.17.2	Then you will not need to use a computer as gateway	St
1.18.1	Maybe as a client it could sub for the 606?	St
