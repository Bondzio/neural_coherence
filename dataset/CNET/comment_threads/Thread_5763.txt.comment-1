I have a Windows 98 Packard Bell PC (Model 882) Mother Board 990 Series Configuration Cyrix M-II 333Mhz Processor Hard Disk Maxtor 9043202 4.32 GB Ram 128 MB 1.
Can anybody give any suggestions on Upgrade 2.
I primarily use the PC for browsing and also some software I have installed.
Since I plan to buy a new computer in the next 2 Years, I want to spend a little money on this to upgrade it.
My thought is just to upgrade thr hardisk to some 20GB.
What kind of Hard drive would be suitable for my PC???
Can I get a used one???
Can anyone suggest any brand, specs??
?
