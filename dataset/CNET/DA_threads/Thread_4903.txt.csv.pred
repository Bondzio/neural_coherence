1.1.1	I am using a HP deskjet Model 3745 on my home computer network .	St
1.1.2	2 PCs are connected .	St
1.1.3	Both using Windows Millenium with all patches etc. , up to date .	St
1.1.4	PC1 : -First machine config : P4 2.0Ghz , 128Mb ram , 40Gb HDD , 52X Cdwriter , FDD , 15 '' monitor .	St
1.1.5	PC2 : -Second machine Config : Celeron 1Ghz , 128Mb ram , 40Gb HDD , FDD , 15 '' monitor .	St
1.1.6	Both are connected directly .	St
1.1.7	The printer is connected through USB port of PC1 and mapped to PC2 Printing is perfect from PC1 but when printing from PC2 it prints in brown / dark red color even though I have enabled ''print in grey scale - use black cartridge '' in the printer option .	St
1.1.8	This happens at random .	St
1.1.9	I have no idea when it will print properly .	St
1.1.10	I print legal documents on stamp paper and it becomes a total waste if the printout comes out in red/ brown ! !	St
1.1.11	''Hp support '' says that they can not guarantee proper printouts on the network as it is on USB Port ? ?	Ques
1.1.12	This problem happened with Main PC where the printer is connected for which the advise has been Reinstall the driver as the driver may be corrupt .	St
1.1.13	Fact is this printer is in use for the last 3 months with no problems but suddenly it has become un-usable .	St
1.1.14	there have been no system crashes , both PCs are on UPS , anti virus , spyware , ets. , are all up to date !	St
1.1.15	Please help ! ! !	St
1.1.16	** Last time I reinsatlled the driver ( 24/9/2005 ) it gave an error message insufficient memory ( 120 Mb ) but allowed me to complete the install .	St
1.1.17	Could this be the problem ?	Ques
1.1.18	But the same has worked for last 3 months .	St
1.2.1	The DOS based Windows such as 95/98/ME all have a nasty 64 kilobyte memory pool that when it runs dry could cause a report like & quot ; This happens at random .	St
1.2.2	I have no idea when it will print properly .	St
1.2.3	I print legal documents on stamp paper and it becomes a total waste if the printout comes out in red/ brown !	St
1.2.4	! & quot ; There is no fix planned .	St
1.2.5	This OS is from an era of computing where we accepted we would have to reboot every few hours and & quot ; not do too much. & quot ; Try this .	St
1.2.6	Reboot to free up resources at the beginning of the process .	St
1.2.7	If there is a print server on one of these older OSes , reboot it first .	St
1.2.8	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but no fix is planned and HP may not offer any education about this old issue .	St
1.2.9	Here 's a link to articles about memory use and optimizing this old Windows : http : //aumha.org/articles.php Worth noting is a & quot ; complex & quot ; printout could trigger this as well .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thankyou for your brief .	St
1.3.2	I was previously using HP 640C desk jet printer on the parallel port and for 3 years there were no such problems .	St
1.3.3	This printer also is 3 months old for last 2 1/2 months worked perfectly well .	St
1.3.4	There are no multiple programs running .	St
1.3.5	Only MS Word 2000 to draft the document and then print .	St
1.3.6	HP support says & quot ; In USB port printer they can not guarantee printouts from the client PC ?	Ques
1.3.7	? & quot ; So I am not sure if this is a memory problem .	St
1.3.8	Also this system is used only for drafting legal documents and no additional programs or TSRs are running except AVG anti virus and Zone Alarm .	St
1.3.9	There has been no additional programs loaded .	St
1.3.10	As per HP support suggesstion driver was uninstalled and reinstalled and it worked for 3-4 days .	St
1.3.11	Now back to the same problem .	St
1.3.12	Could it be a problem with the printer itself ?	Ques
1.3.13	?	Ques
1.4.1	Hi ! , I am getting the same problem .	St
1.4.2	Reasion I concluded is your main computer to which the printer is attached is using colour cartriage when take colour print , and uses black and white cartriage when u use black and white print , but nothing is like this with other computer on network .	St
1.4.3	The other computer on network always uses the colour cartriage , even if u select grayscale-black & white option , and the fact is your colour cartriage is about to empty .	St
1.4.4	Just refill your colour cartraige u will get rid of this problem .	St
1.4.5	U have only 2 systems on your network so do n't have much problem but I have 15 systems so I am having a bit problem .	St
1.4.6	All computers except one is using the colour cartriage .	St
1.4.7	Thus colour cartriage is getting emply early .	St
1.4.8	If any body have solution of this problem kindly advice .	Polite
1.4.9	Thanks in advance ... msnegi98	St
1.5.1	You claim it worked before , but I see more people installing more software such as firewall on these DOS based OS 's and not realize the extra load will cause new issues .	St
1.5.2	You changed the setup so have to rethink the cause .	St
1.5.3	There is a reason why this old OS is fading away .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	In my experience this happens when the account printing does not have admin rights on the PC that the printer is installed on .	St
1.6.2	Try it with 2 accounts on the same PC ( remove the colour cart ) and try forcing it to black .	St
1.6.3	You will find that if you dont have admin privileges in uses the colour cartage no matter what .	St
1.6.4	I dont consider sticking users in a local admin group so they can print , a valid fix but it might help you .	St
1.7.1	Only in NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista does the concept of security and admin accounts start to show .	St
