Cheers, Doug.

My first router back in 1990 did exactly what the name implied. Today, 2009 the &quot;router&quot; is that consumer piece of gear that comes with wifi, router with NAT, switched hub and more. Without nailing down the year you want to define this in and a context the exact definition can be fluid. Bob

It was actually the fact that the definition of router *is* so dynamic, that caused me to post in a forum rather than Google. There's various different conflicting factual sets of &quot;definitions&quot; out there so I wanted an expert opinion not a set of conflicting facts (as you get bogged down with if you use Google to compile a glossary - which I'm doing). The year I want to define this in is 2009, and the context is that I'm putting together a generic glossary (hoping to encompass definitions in the consumer, enterprise, industry, etc contexts). Does anyone know of any good networking glossary sites...? Doug.

If I were to take my 1970's networking (yes we had networks back then) I would not be able to talk to today's owners as I would be constantly correcting them that a Linksys Wifi router is not a &quot;router&quot; but has many networking components inside that enclosure. You've found the right 2009 definition and I think you should go with that and finish your definitions today. Bob
