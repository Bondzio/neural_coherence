<s> (Disclaimer: I am a newbie to these more complex computer issues) My wife and I just inherited a Seagate External Hard Drive; she uses a Mac and I use a PC. </s>
<s> I've been searching web forums for a way to format the HD so we can both use it, and have not found any solutions. </s>
<s> It looks like the best solution is to use some sort of &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; program. </s>
<s> I'm hoping you more educated folk can help me out with 2 questions: 1) what sort of NTFS program would you recommend? </s>
<s> and 2) I've seen a number of freeware &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; programs on the web: are these effective and safe? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> You didn't say but the newer versions can deal with NTFS natively. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
<s> Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 - we've had the machine for a couple years. </s>
<s> Is this new enough? </s>
<s> And (here I'm revealing my ignorance) just to be sure: to say that newer Mac operating systems can deal with NTFS &quot;natively&quot; is to say that such a machine wouldn't have a problem syncing with an NTFS formatted external drive, yes? </s>
<s> http://www.tool-box.info/blog/archives/1193-On-NTFS-readwrite-support-in-Snow-Leopard.html notes the native method. </s>
<s> You can also try NTFS-3G as noted at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/macnifying-os-x-introduction-and-working-with-ntfs-drives/ You won't spend a dime. </s>

<s> Many thanks. </s>
