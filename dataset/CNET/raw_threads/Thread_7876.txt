You may need to look fast as sometimes this happens before the monitor warms enough. Also, some BIOS will display processor information. You need to interupt the startup and search. Pressing Del, F1, or F2 usually covers these but vary from machine to machine.

You can find out by pressing the windows key and pause key at the same time or right click &quot;My PC&quot; and go to Properties. The System Properies window will show up and it'll tell you the operation system you're running (like what type of Windows you're running) also the prossesor speed and how much memory you have. Keep digging on the System Properties window and you will find intresting thins like what other type of hardware you have in your PC etc...
