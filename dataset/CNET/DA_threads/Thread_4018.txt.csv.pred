1.1.1	well i have taken the leap into the wonderfull world of overclocking just to try it out .	St
1.1.2	heres what i got amd64 venice 3000+ @ 2.20ghz ( 9x244 ) system is running rock solid and i am very happy with the performance boost .	St
1.1.3	now , my idle temp is at about 33c-36c and my load temps are around 39c-47c ( cpu-burn for 20mins @ 47c ) i did not mess with any voltage settings and actually set my ram to 166 instead of its stock 200 ( geil value ram 2gb pc3200 in duel channel mode ) but with the overclock its right back up to 199. pci and agp bus is locked at stock speeds .	St
1.1.4	my question is , is this an acceptable overclock or is there something i have missed or could have done better , remember folks this is my first overclock so be gentle in your replys ... .i 'm sensitive ... .. ( | ) thanks in advance for your suggestions ! ! !	St
1.1.5	!	St
1.2.1	Why 9 x 244 and not 13 x 166 ?	Ques
1.3.1	OC'ing is OK until something happens .	St
1.3.2	Common OC'ing only provides a slight edge oevr stock .	St
1.3.3	If you continue OC you will shorten the & quot ; life cycle & quot ; of componets any/or all of them .	St
1.3.4	Further , its even more important that system be cooled at best as possible as if and when cooling decreasing , the likelyhood of quick failure is that much more present , in other words for an AMD cpu , unlike an Intel cpu , wo n't trottle down , though it should shutdown or try a reboot .	St
1.3.5	This is done in order to save the cpu .	St
1.3.6	It becomes more apparent when messing with cpu voltage in order to keep stable but the side effect is greater heat output as well .	St
1.3.7	I suggest you find the safe and stable level allowed and be happy when reached .	St
1.3.8	Continue wanting more will prove the above statements , enjoy once you find that maintainable level .	St
1.3.9	Visit OC websites and see what they do , like http : //www.overclockers.com or google similar .	St
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
