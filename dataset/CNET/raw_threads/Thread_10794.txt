12565	0	116850	1327880	NR	Jckdarippr	7/28/05 6:51 PM	1.12257666E12	I have no idea	So I'm running a custom computer with: AMD Athlon XP 2800 1 GB OCZ PC3200 DDR RAM ASUS A7N8X Deluxe Mobo Leadtek GeForce 6600 GT 120 GB Western Digital HD Now when i try to plug in my Creative MuVo to put songs on it, the entire computer goes crazy and everything just stops responding, with System Idle Process taking up 99 percent of the CPU cycle. I'm running Windows XP Professional SP 2...any idea why my computer goes haywire when i plug in a flash drive?

Or, when the hardware being used is defective. Try it in another machine.
