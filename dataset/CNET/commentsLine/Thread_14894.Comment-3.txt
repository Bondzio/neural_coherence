hello, i own an emachines t3418 as well and have worked on dozens over the years, seeing as emachines is a &quot;budget&quot; system builder they include some cheaper parts which lead to hardware failure.
the one i have noticed the most is power supplies, i would highly recommend you replace the factory psu they are cheap and will greatly extend the life of the system, the older machines especially.
i have bought and found many p4/celeron era emahiches all with dead psu's and dead motherboards
