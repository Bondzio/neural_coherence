visualdreamers llc is a properly registered business based in ohio and its address is located in an office park.
from the photo on google streetview, they could indeed be a small custom pc maker.
ohio business filing listing the link you posted is from 2005 but visualdreamers llc was listed in 2007. domain names get bought all the time and all the &quot;bad press&quot; about them stems from that 4 year old post about the domain name.
now i do believe the original post here and many other posts on various forms are self-promotion by the company since they all read about the same and were posted by folks who just joined the forums.
but trying to draw folks to your product and &quot;scam&quot; are two different things.
