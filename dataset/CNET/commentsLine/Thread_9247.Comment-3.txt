did you notice for that particular computer it only cost $29 to upgrade from a 40gb hard drive to 80gb.
check the dell configuration page for that pc.
also seems to be $20 cheaper for what you have listed for components.
dell is no worst than any other factory on service.
last time i checked in pc mag, it was rated slightly better than the rest.
