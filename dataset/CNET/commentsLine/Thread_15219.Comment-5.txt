i have a gateway mt6840, and it says the display adapter is 945gm express chipset family.
when the laptop went to sleep, the second monitor could turn on again, but when it hibernated, the second monitor stayed off, but was still there, ie i could move my mouse onto it, as well as other windows.
thanks for your help.
also, i'm out of warranty since i got it over a year ago.
