<s> I have a second pc that I rarely use anymore. </s>
<s> but recently while running it really loud noises started in the tower and then the screen froze up. </s>
<s> I ended up shutting it down by pulling the plug, was the only way. </s>
<s> When I plugged it back up I got a message saying no c drive detected.........and the noise came back....ok my question is what happened and should I try to fix it? </s>
<s> if so what could it be? </s>
<s> and / or should I just throw it out? </s>
<s> The best part of noise, you follow your ear and find what's making the noise. </s>
<s> Thus, you take it from there. </s>
<s> If you haven't open your case, this is a good time to do so. </s>
<s> Repeated power-UPs may seal the fate of whatever is making the noise or the whole system. </s>
<s> Come back with what you've found. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the cover is off and right now it is running normal so Im waiting on the noise again ........stand by </s>
<s> I was running it scanning for disk errors and it made the noise but only a brief moment then stopped......also after that there was ticking like a clock then a thud?...now it is just locked up and will not do anything! </s>
<s> You should definitely check to see that any existing fans are running okay, but it sounds to me at first glance you have a demo'ed hard drive. </s>
<s> Ticking like a clock and then a thud is a pretty good indication the read arm is defective, and most likely broken all together. </s>
<s> If it's still accessing c: drive, it may not be too late to get your stuff off of there. </s>
<s> This doesn't mean the rest of the unit is garbage, just the hard drive needs replacing. </s>
<s> If it's particularly old, it may not be worth it to you to replace the hard drive if in fact that's the problem. </s>
<s> There's a remote possibility it's a fan and an overheat is wht's causing the lock-up but I really doubt it. </s>
