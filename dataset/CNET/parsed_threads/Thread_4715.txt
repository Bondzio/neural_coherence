<s> I am looking for a video capture (pci or usb)that is compatible with PCIe?? </s>
<s> Read a couple of reviews RE: bought capture cards from Tiger Direct, But would Not work with their PCIe.?? </s>
<s> Want to transfer VHS/SVHS &gt; DVD, & my echostar DVR (dish network)&gt; DVD; so I would need L&R channels & &quot;S&quot; input. </s>
<s> would like to spend Under $200. </s>
<s> Thanks, web86 </s>
<s> a video card interface slot, a few other devices use it, but it's essentially the new AGP if your machine doesn't have PCIe you shouldn't even worry (only newer machines have PCIe slots, if you could provide some information about your machine (as the red text suggests) I could tell you if you even have a PCIe slot) in addition to that I would suggest this as a possibility: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814144502 </s>
