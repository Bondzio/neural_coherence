i'm not really sure where to start.
i've done some research about this online, but i'm still not sure exactly what i need.
the apartment i'm moving into this summer already has wireless access via another person in the building, so i guess this works the same way as a wireless hotspot.
i'm just not entirely sure what hardware/software i need for my computer to be able to access the network.
i have a dell dimension desktop 4500 that's about 3 years old.
a friend told me to get netgear's wireless pc card, something like the wg511.
will installing this card allow me to access the wireless network?
if not, what would i need to buy?
thanks for any help.
