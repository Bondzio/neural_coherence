i agree that using technology that is a few months old can give you some very good value, you might also plan to take advantage of opening day specials when windows vista is finally released.
for the last two major releases (xp and me) microsoft and/or store vendors have put together some very attractive bundles with both hardware and other software packages which were only available on release day.
my personal experience is that i was able to perform some significant upgrades on my existing computers (cd burners, dvd drives, hard drives, video cards, memory, ms plus, antivirus software and more) since my computers were only a few months old at the time.
in both cases, i got at least the value of the windows software in useful upgraded hardware and software.
another potential option if you want to be the first with windows vista on your block is to possibly order your computer slightly before the official release of vista.
i think i remember (maybe just getting old and forgetful though) that xp was actually available on new computers slightly before the official release of the software in stores.
if you are planning on buying from a major computer vendor, such as dell or gateway, you could always check with them as the vista release date approaches on exactly when the new operating system will be available on new computers.
good luck!
