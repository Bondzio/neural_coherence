my computer froze up on me recently, so i switched off the power supply.
when i booted up again i had found that my 320gb hard drive now only has 127gb.. all my files are still around but most of my ripped movies now have a size of 0mb.
i am running windows 7, the hard drive is a seagate barracuda 320gb 7200.11 what is going on?
