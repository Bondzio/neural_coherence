1.1.1	Im considering buying this pc with a Athlon 64 3800+ .	St
1.1.2	Just wondering if anyone had experience with this particular model .	St
1.1.3	I could n't find any reviews or info on this model so if u guys knew anything it would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	I looked and looked and looked but I did n't see any either .	St
1.2.2	But you have an Athlon 64 3800+ so it will be wicked fast .	St
1.2.3	If you game , get a decent video card as well .	St
1.3.1	I have the intel version .	St
1.3.2	Suggest you get the top-of-the line 4000+ .	St
1.3.3	As for the gfx card , just get the x300se and upgrade yourself .	St
1.3.4	It comes with 400watt psu , so get a 6600GT .	St
1.3.5	Not sure if the psu can be upgraded though .	Res
1.3.6	Its cheaper if you build yourself .	St
1.3.7	But if you too lazy or no idea , go to monarch , or cyberpower and customize it with retail parts instead of oem .	St
1.3.8	Just my two cents .	St
1.4.1	Since you did n't list the price for this PC , I 'm guessing that you could build one for the same money or less .	St
1.4.2	Now keep in mind that HP will NOT give you the XP CD only a recovery partion on the hard drive .	St
1.4.3	They use a non standard MB so you will not be able to upgrade that .	St
1.4.4	I think of HP as a low cost alternitive to Dell .	St
1.4.5	John	St
