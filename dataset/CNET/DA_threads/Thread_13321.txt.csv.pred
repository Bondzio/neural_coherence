1.1.10	I used the system recovery disc , then when it asked I canceled out of the disc and it self started chkdsk - 8 of 8 segments unreadable - index $ 130 file 31 being fixed .	St
1.1.11	I CANT boot in any of the safe modes or to a previous config .	St
1.1.12	No matter what option I pick , it just loops back to the page with the & quot ; We apologize for the inconvenience , but.. & quot ; options .	St
1.1.13	I tried a Hard Disk Self Test and got the error # 1 -07 Fail , 10 seconds after it started .	St

1.1.18	Any help is greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	have you tried to boot from the old copy of XP or from your system restore ?	Ques
1.2.2	you wont want to start a restore or anything but it seems like you just need to be able to access the hardrive to get your files out .	St
1.2.3	and for the future , i would recommend that you get a backup program and a nice , fat external hdd .	St
1.2.4	1TBs run for around $ 200 or less now i think .	St
1.3.1	I tried to get to the system restore with no luck .	St
1.3.2	I have an old copy of XP Pro .	St
1.3.3	If I boot off of the CD , would I still be able to view my HD ?	Ques
1.3.4	I am being extra cautious because I dont want to lose the data .	St
1.3.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	If you are serious about this you remove the hard disk from the machine and put it into some desktop or USB case .	St
1.4.2	Then you explore data recovery software with titles like : GETDATABACK ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY ( many ) LINUX BOOT CDs All found with google but if the files are worth something , this is how its done .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I had this same problem .	St
1.5.2	Other web info suggested a drive failure .	St
1.5.3	I even suspected I would need a new copy of Vista or XP ( It came installed on my HP/Compaq ) .	St
1.5.4	Here 's what worked for me : I started the computer and went to the diagnostic mode .	St
1.5.5	Message was that Windows could not fix it .	St
1.5.6	Then went to the & quot ; Advanced Help & quot ; hotspot on the panel and selected & quot ; Go to System & quot ; ( which is a DOS panel ) .	St
1.5.7	I then went to the C : drive root directory with C : then typed CHKDSK /F /R to force DOS to try to locate and repair any bad files or clusters .	St
1.5.8	This took about 45 minutes to complete but located quite a few orphaned files .	St
1.5.9	BTW : You will get a message about CHKDSK not being able to repair because the session is held by another process , but you will get an option to disconnect it .	St
1.5.10	Tell it to disconnect it .	St
1.5.11	Then , restart the computer .	St
1.5.12	Vista will take longer to restart because it has to rebuild some tables , but eventually it came back to me just fine .	St
1.5.13	Since I had never made a restart/backup disk , I made it my first task to get this done .	St
1.5.14	I hope this is encouraging to you and you can get it to work again .	St
1.5.15	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	Thanks for the info - 1 quick question ; You posted & quot ; I started the computer and went to the diagnostic mode. & quot ; Is the diagnostic mode in the bios or within windows ( specifically how do I get there ) ?	Ques
1.6.2	Thanks a ton .	Polite
1.7.1	Hi , I tried using CHKDSK/F/R command on DOS , but it failed at stage 2 of 5 , giving a message & quot ; Insufficient disk space to recover lost data & quot ;	St
1.8.1	Hi , I think you need a software from critical rescue team will also contain solution to a formatted hard drive recovery .	St
1.8.2	Pls remind us to send you the link as soon as possible .	St
1.8.3	Thanks .	Polite
