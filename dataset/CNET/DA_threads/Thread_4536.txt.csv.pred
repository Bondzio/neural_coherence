1.1.1	I need to buy a GOOD gaming PC for myself .	St
1.1.2	I will be playing games like Battlefield 2 , F.E.A.R , Rainbow 6 Las Vegas , and other awesome games like that .	St
1.1.3	I can not spend more than $ 1000 on this .	St
1.1.4	All i want to know is what are the best things to get so I can get good memory , a good video card and all that junk .	St
1.1.5	Please help .	St
1.1.6	Thanks a lot .	St
1.1.7	I 'm really only a casual gamer .	St
1.1.8	I will play Rainbow 6 and Battlefield mostly .	St
1.1.9	I probably wo n't even have any other games on my computer .	St
1.1.10	What I am looking for is basically an awesome pc that can handle those games easily so i do n't get mad that it lags all the time .	St
1.1.11	But along with that , I do n't need , and wo n't spend money on , the $ 4000 - $ 5000 pc 's .	St
1.1.12	How about the Gateway FX530XM with : -Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 ( 2.40GHz , 1066MHz FSB , 4MB cache , non-HT ) -2048MB 667MHz Dual-Channel DDR2 SDRAM ( 2-1024MB modules ) -Intel 975X Chipset with DDR2 and Intel Core Duo support -500GB 7200rpm Serial ATA II/ 300 hard drive w/ 8MB cache & Raid 0 ( 2-250GB hard drives ) and either one of these ( I ca n't decide on which one I actually need ) : -NVIDIA GeForce 7600GT 256MB DDR2 Video Card Dual DVI/ TV -NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS w/ 320MB , Dual DVI-I Dual link TV Out ( Factory Overclocked ) w/ VGA adapter	St
1.2.1	I know i said i do n't want to spend more than $ 1000 , but the reason I like the Gateway is because I can get a computer from either Gateway or Dell for a little bit cheaper .	St
1.2.2	So it would actually be a good price .	Polite
1.3.1	.- & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/2007/06/11/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ The 8800 is noted .	St
1.3.2	See how it fared .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	how about an xbox360 for $ 400 ...	St
1.5.1	you 're looking at a $ 105 geforce 7600gt and a $ 285 8800gts .	St
1.5.2	why ?	Ques
1.5.3	if the 8800gts fits in your budget , get it because there 's no other $ 300 card that can match its peformance .	St
1.5.4	if you only have $ 200 , get a radeon x1900xt .	St
1.5.5	if only $ 160 , its a tough call between a geforce 8600gts ( dx10 ) , geforce 7900gs ( faster ) , or radeon x1950pro ( fastest ) .	St
1.5.6	do n't put anything slower ( like a 7600gt ) in a new gaming rig .	St
1.6.1	so your saying either the 8800gts or the radeon x1950pro .	St
1.6.2	but if i want i can get the 7900 gs and still play my games without getting really mad cuz the frame rate sucks ?	Ques
1.6.3	but when i buy it from gateway.com i have the choice between the 8800GTS ( $ 299.00 ) or the ATI Radeon X1900 Crossfire w/ 512 MB ( $ 357.00 ) nothing about 1950 PRO it says crossfire and its an added $ 470 .	St
1.6.4	so idk which one to get since i 've actually never used ANY of them b4 .	St
1.6.5	all i want is to play a few games without getting any lag .	St
1.6.6	thanks a lot by the way .	Polite
1.6.7	really appreciate it .	Polite
1.7.1	gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc .	St
1.7.2	gateway 's price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre-install it for you .	St
1.7.3	the x1900 crossfire wo n't match the all-around performance of the 8800gts .	St
1.7.4	as i said before , if you do n't have the budget for the 8800gts , get what you can afford from the earlier list .	St
