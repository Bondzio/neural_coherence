i tried your suggestion of unplugging it and trying a different cable.
i left it unplugged for about 30 minutes and borrowed the cable from my hp printer, plugged it all back in turned it on and then plugged it into my computer.
one last hurrah and it worked.
thank you so much for the help, otherwise i would've had a $150 paperweight, thanks again- nick
