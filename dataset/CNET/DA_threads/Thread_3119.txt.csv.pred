1.1.1	Hello - I 'm thinking of buying the Samsung 244T widescreen LCD for my PC .	St
1.1.2	I 'm also buying a new PC and want to make sure everything 's compatible .	St
1.1.3	What will I need as far as a video card ?	Ques
1.1.4	I know that some PC games are compatible with 16:9 ratio , but what about the ones that are n't ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will they be stretched out or just normal size ( 4:3 ) on the screen - with black bars on the left and right of the screen ?	Ques
1.1.6	Any help is much appreciated ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks Tim	Polite
1.2.1	If a display ai n't wide enough , black bars appear along the top and bottom .	St
1.2.2	If it 's too wide , I 'm sure black bars appear on the sides instead .	St
1.2.3	As for a vid card , just check to see it supports widescreen resolutions ( divide the numbers to see if you get the 16:9 ratio )	St
1.3.1	I run the http : //www.widescreengamingforum.com We work to find solutions for individual games .	St
1.3.2	Each game is different in it 's support of widescreen .	St
1.3.3	Some games wo n't support it , and you will have the option of stretching or black bars .	St
1.3.4	Those that do support a non-stretched resolution , might not have a perfect FOV .	St
1.3.5	If your montior supports 1:1 or Aspect Scaling , then you wo n't have any problems .	St
1.3.6	If not , Nvidia offers this option in their drivers .	St
1.3.7	ATI does not .	Res
1.3.8	You wo n't see a widescreen res in your driver list until you hook up a widescreen monitor .	St
1.3.9	They should appear automatically .	St
1.3.10	If you 're looking for a res that is n't there , you 'll have to add it manually .	St
1.3.11	You can use a tool called Powerstrip to do that .	St
1.3.12	I believe you can also add custom res in the driver panel in Nvidia 's driver set .	St
1.4.1	I have posted a query along the same lines but I now wonder if its a coincidence that the vast majority af TFT 's are standard 4:3 aspect .	St
1.4.2	Perhaps widescreen is more bother than it 's worth as there are few unknowns about standard monitors .	St
