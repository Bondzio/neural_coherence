I have XP installed in my Intel Macbook Pro in the separate partition created by boot camp. Recently while I was running on XP the computer crashed badly and XP system seemed to have been damaged and I can't boot as XP anymore. I would like to simply erase the XP partition and merge it with the main drive. But the problem is that Boot Camp got expired and I can't use the application to do that. Can anyone tell me how I can do that?? I am guessing that Disk Utility would be the one to use but I want to make sure I know what I am doing before I screw up anything... Please help!! Thanks. DA

Goto on your mac partition utilities &gt;&gt; Disk Rtility then click the windows partition. Click Erase tab and select &quot;MS-DOS(FAT)&quot; and name it untitled. Then goto Bootcamp and the installer will allow you to erase partition and merge it with exsisting Mac osX Partition. WARNING: ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE MERGING, FORMATING OR INSTALLING AN OS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARTITION.
