Hello.
I have a new HP a1010n Intel Celeron D Processor, 512MB DDR SDRAM memory 160GB 7200RPM Ultra DMA hard drive.
I also have a Compaq Presario that is currently not working because my processor fried.
I will like to put my old 40GB hard drive into my new pc - How do I put the old hard drive into the new pc?
Also, are there any dangers or warnings I should know about before doing this?
I will appreciate all the help.
Bob or Ray, I'll appreciate your input.
Thanks.
YLC
