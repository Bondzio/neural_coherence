<s> I feel really dumb, but i can't find the switch or button to turn it on. </s>
<s> The light comes on fine when i plug it in, but the next step, put something in to scan and press a button. </s>
<s> I honestly have looked and felt over the scanner, but am stumped! </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> thanks null14 </s>
<s> Some scanners have front panel buttons or a touchpad that initiates some software processes but the scanner operation is controlled by your PC. </s>
<s> Did you load the software and connect the scanner to the PC? </s>
<s> HP's software was and may still be &quot;Precision Scan Pro&quot;. </s>
<s> It also will have a &quot;copy machine&quot; function. </s>
<s> You can initiate the scanning process by opening the scanning application and click on the right buttons from there.....with your mouse. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Just the scan and such buttons. </s>
<s> I looked over the documentation when I set it up and sure enough there is none. </s>
<s> Cost saving move I bet. </s>

<s> I posted late last night and must not have sent my message. </s>
<s> The 2100 C comes with Precision Scan software, which should set up software buttons. </s>
<s> On my 4070 the software is called HP Director. </s>
<s> Mine turns on at start up and turns off 10 minutes later. </s>
<s> Activating one of the software buttons turns it back on. </s>
<s> As Bob mentioned, it may have been a cost savings attempt, or it may have been an attempts to eliminate another part to fail down the road. </s>
<s> Look here for HP support. </s>
