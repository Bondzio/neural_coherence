the desktop itself can last much longer but like an exotic foreign car, once something goes wrong it is difficult and/or expensive to fix if you don't have a supply of matching parts.
but with proper care, which includes keeping it clean, cool and protecting it from power spikes a pc will last 10 years.
seriously if you dont vacuum out your tower you pc will be wearing a sweater inside its case and a single power spike (unless it is from lightning) shouldn't wreck you stuff but the constant fluctuations which are common (especially if you are on the same circuit as anything with a compressor) will eventually render your hardware useless (assuming your software is not outdated by then).
the problem is that unless you bought a top end machine right after the latest os came out your system will be slow and your software will become outdated and incompatible after 3-4 years add an extra year for the new os top-end machine.
my advice is to always buy a middle of the road machine, unless you are a serious gamer (and then you don't need my advice), about a year after the new os comes out.
let someone else pay for being the early adopter and you can get 90% of the performance for 50% of the price (or 75% of the performance for 20% of the price).
as long as you upgrade to a new machine about every 5 years you will always be happy with your new machine, even if it is not super fast, it will be much faster than what you are used to.
of course once they figure out how to put real power into a tablet the landscape will change.
