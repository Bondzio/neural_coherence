You can buy a PC in the USA when on sale or &quot;entry level&quot; models that are in $350+ excludes taxes and/or any S/H, but a decent price should start in the $500 or more. It still depends on what is put into the PC as well, because better named devices or performance to include GPU, PSU and/or extra cooling etc. not to mention the case as well would push pricing up. So, let's be realistic in finding a gaming PC would demand better funds to spend. I exclude the availability of any used parts or carry-over parts to a newer PC that one can build. Also, the OS for now is generally when a retail versions is in the $100+ range as an added expense if not carried over from old PC in legitimate fashion. good luck tada -----Willy
