When I open &quot;My Computer&quot; all that is listed is a:// and c:// What can I do!? What did I do that may have caused this? My computer is a few years old. I'm using Windows 98 and it's an AMD Athlon Processor (not sure how much info to give about the 'puter) Any ideas?! Thank you!!!

When I boot up the computer, there is stuff at the very beginnig that used to say &quot;Found&quot; now it says &quot;Not detected&quot;...I think one of them may say something about BIOS...I'm so computer illiterate!

You mentioned that the computer is a bit old and answering to someone else you mentioned that when the computer is going through a POST (Power On Self Test), it says that they are not detected. The most common reason for this is bad wires or just loose wires. This is pretty easy to fix or replace. Open up your case (Make sure its turned off, don't want to get a shock) and look and check that the cable is fully pressed in. Turn on your computer and if it still doesn't find them, then replace them. The cables are IDE cables and pretty inexpensive. This is not difficult to replace, just pull out the cable and install. They only slide in one way so no need to worry about installing them backwards.
