1.1.1	Hello all, I have a bit of a problem, my hard drive recently started clicking and I am not able to start up Windows Xp without completly disconnecting the drive.	St
1.1.2	The drive is a Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 and I was wondering if the hard drive is fried?	St
1.1.3	I have almost 120 Gigs of data on the drive and don't really want to format it, but I will if I need to.	St
1.1.4	I don't want to spend alot of money getting it fixed either.	St
1.1.5	I really just want to pull pictures off the drive.	St
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	There is never a homebrew fix for clicking drives and it's only a financial decision where the files are worth the recover fees from drivesavers.com or others.	St
1.2.2	Beware that advice of changing the circuit board of the drive.	St
1.2.3	You may hamper the recover house's work and increase the fee.	St
1.2.4	Can I ask where the backup copy of the files you can't lose are?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I just had a Maxtor harddrive make that same sound.	St
1.3.2	I downloaded PowerMax diagnostic software from Maxtor and it reported that it was failing.	St
1.3.3	It sounds like it is cooked to me but try Powermax and you'll get know for sure.	St
1.3.4	Bill	St
1.4.1	I never did back up my photos and various documents.	St
1.4.2	I should have.	St
1.4.3	Does that mean I have to format my drive?	St
1.4.4	Its not the end of the world if I do, just wanting to know.	St
1.4.5	Thanks again	St
1.5.1	Never format a drive that has files you want to recover.	St
1.5.2	Replace the drive.	St
1.5.3	I just picked up a new 300GB 7200RPM drive for 99 bucks so if you attempt to format a drive with files you want back you just revealed the files are worth less than this.	St
1.5.4	With the new drive installed we place the old drive in the packing from the new drive and wait till we decide if it's worth it.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	I tried adding the cables to the back of the drive when I get into windows and it shows that nothing is on the drive just from the properties button but I downloaded a free trail recovery program that shows that 120 gigs of data are still on the drive, but when it tries to access the information it just keeps clicking?	St
1.6.2	Any ideas?	St
1.6.3	If I could just get into the drive one more time then I could back up all the information that I wanted.	St
1.6.4	Thanks for all the help so far.	St
1.7.1	Just a thought.	St
1.7.2	I have the same drive (120GB Maxtor DM9) with a similar symptom, turns out my PSU was overloaded and wasn't allowing the drive to draw the required current to perform seek / write ops reliably.	St
1.7.3	I upgraded my PSU and so far so good.	St
1.7.4	You could try disconnecting some devices and see if the problem improves.	Sug
1.7.5	When trying to recover data (and getting desperate) I have tried the following: Cooling the drive (in the freezer) then keeping it cool while transferring data (use a desk fan) Standing the drive on its edge/end (changes the load on the spindle bearings, can help with weak head armatures) Tapping the side of the drive when it clicks (helps a sticking head armature) If none of this works then the chances are the drive is stuffed.	St
1.8.1	There is a 90% chance that you can get everything back with Spinrite 6.	St
1.8.2	The 'clicking' is a normal operation of a HDD to try and locate a sector that is not working well.	St
1.8.3	Spinrite 6 is a kind of non-destructive low-level formatter and many data recovery companies use it but charge you LOTS more for the job.	St
1.8.4	Why hasn't everybody got this program - OK so it costs $89.00 (US) but it can be shared between you and several friends and it works wonders in Data Recovery and Drive Recovery and Failure Prevention.	St
1.8.5	And when I say 'Drive' recovery I mean All drives Floppy, Hard, ATA, SATA, SCSI, ZIP, JAZ, - Windows, Unix and more.	St
1.8.6	If your PC won't boot from the drive, set you BIOS to boot from floppy (or USB if you haven't got a floppy) and fire up Spinrite from there.	St
1.8.7	It's tiny and fits onto a floppy easily (pure machine code).	St
1.8.8	On a HDD that size it will take hours to run so fire it up and leave it to do it's job overnight - it's often worth doing it twice if you've got time.	St
1.8.9	Go to http://www.grc.com/intro.htm for Spinrite and whole load of Free stuff as well.	St
1.8.10	The videos are also well worth watching so that you understand what Spinrite is doing.	St
1.9.1	The drive may or may not be failing.	St
1.9.2	If this is a new sound it probably will fail.	St
1.9.3	As someone else suggested, since the price of hard drives have come way down, buy another drive and keep your old one.	St
1.9.4	Put it in a good external case and use it strictly for data.	St
1.9.5	If it has already failed, there are a number of good data recovery programs to be had (and some were mentioned) that may enable you to recover your data.	St
1.9.6	If you are primarily concerned with only photos, many programs exist to recover them - even those that have been ''deleted''.	St
1.10.1	A clicking drive is a sign of death, or near death.	St
1.10.2	I don't recommend using the old drive for anything further, especially for backing up data, because it isn't trustworthy.	St
1.10.3	Even if you did get the old drive up and running again using one of the techniques described here, it wouldn't be prudent to trust it.	St
1.10.4	Take your valuables off of it and recycle the scrap metal.	St
1.10.5	My advice is to purchase a fresh new hard drive to power up your computer and connect the second one, (at least temporarily), as a secondary slave drive.	St
1.10.6	If the old drive still spins you can then retrieve all of your photos and personal stuff off of it.	St
1.10.7	As a matter of course I always add a secondary drive to all of my computers to keep my created and saved files separate from the operating drive.	St
1.10.8	It seems that the &quot;C&quot; drive is always the one that fails.	St
1.10.9	Keep your precious creations separate whenever possible.	St
1.11.1	&quot;You can try the freezer trick if the drive is acting flaky and/or not much else has really been helpful in getting data off the drive.	St
1.11.2	First, let the drive reach about room temperature before proceeding.	St
1.11.3	A sudden change in temperature is not all that healthy for a drive.	St
1.11.4	Afterward, put the drive in a freezer bag (a Ziploc bag will do if there arent any freezer bags handy) and squeeze out all the air (leave a little space at the opening of the bag for the air to escape).	St
1.11.5	This is so you avoid condensation while the drive is put into the freezer.	St
1.11.6	Leave it in there for an hour or so.	St
1.11.7	Finally, take it out and slave it to another machine and try to copy over any data you want.	St
1.11.8	This process may need to be repeated a few times in order to copy over everything you need.	St
1.11.9	What the freezer trick does is cool down all the components of the hard drive.	St
1.11.10	It will cool down the overheating chips on the hard drives circuit board (which is a known problem with some models of Maxtor Quantum drives), and as well as allow the platters contract a bit, making it easier for the heads to read the data, thus decreasing read errors.	St
1.11.11	All this trick does is buy some time in order to recover your data.	St
1.11.12	In other words, the drive will need to be replaced.	St
1.11.13	If it is still under warranty, RMA it back to the manufacturer.&quot; http://www.pcmech.com/show/harddrive/664/7 I have also had a bit of success in cooling the drive with compressed air before and during boot.	St
1.11.14	Both of these fixes are temporary.	St
1.11.15	You still need to get the drive out of service ASAP.	St
1.12.1	This happened to my best friend.	St
1.12.2	I pulled the drive, installed a new drive, did a C:\\recorvery.	St
1.12.3	Put the old drive in a USB Hard Drive enclosure.	St
1.12.4	Changed the jumpers, on the old hard drive to a slave, and we were able to pull the data....photos, music, installers, e-mails, off the old one, and now he is up and running and a happy camper.	St
1.13.1	I had the clicking problem with a WDC external drive and it turned out that the jumper had come loose, so when I reset the jumper the drive worked fine from then on.	St
1.13.2	Since you dropped the drive, it is &quot;possible&quot; that the jumper came loose...	St
1.13.3	However, and unfortunately, a dropped drive is not a good thing so without a &quot;recertification&quot; of some kind, it can be on the way to failing.	St
1.14.1	There are many reasons for drives to start failing and lowering the temperature may help overheating parts.	St
1.14.2	My experience with recovering data from a clicking hard drive used the opposite approach, that is I let the hard drive warm up.	St
1.14.3	This system was not used much and with the cooler weather the system was taking a long time to startup or failing to start.	St
1.14.4	So leave the system on for 20 minutes and then restart allowed the recovery or transfer of much of the data to another drive.	St
1.14.5	In this case I had moved the clicking drive to a new system as the slave or secondary drive and waited for the drive to warm up.	St
1.14.6	There are physical reasons why warm drives work better than cold ones.	St
1.14.7	The spacing between the head and disk decrease with increasing temperature which helps improve the SNR being the main reason in this failure.	St
1.14.8	I would not recommend placing the drive in an oven to warm it up but finding a warm place or leaving the drive on or gently wrapping the drive with a clean cloth (hand towel).	Sug
1.14.9	An operating drive will consume around 10 to 20 watts and thermally insulating the drive and waiting will increase the temperature.	St
1.14.10	Of course good luck always helps for your data recovery!	Polite
1.15.1	NIL	St
1.16.1	your computer might be trying to boot into ur usb device.	St
1.17.1	Any time that a mechanical component in your computer starts making new noises, this is always a bad sign.	St
1.17.2	In the case of a hard drive, this can be a warning of impending disaster.	St
1.17.3	These things never heal themselves and invariably get worse.	St
1.17.4	Most systems can accommodate two hard drives and most IDE ribbon cables have connections for two drives.	St
1.17.5	If your cable only has one connector, replace it with one that has two.	St
1.17.6	While the failing drive is still working, install a new drive as a master with a slave present.	St
1.17.7	(Some drives have only master, slave, and cable select settings.	St
1.17.8	In this case, make sure that it is set as a master drive.)	St
1.17.9	Set the jumper on the old drive as a slave.	St
1.17.10	It will take the next available drive letter, mostly likely D. Reinstall the operating system and copy the files that you need to the new drive.	St
1.17.11	Once you have copied all of the files that you need, remove the failing drive.	St
1.17.12	If necessary, set the jumper on the new drive to single drive.	St
1.18.1	I had the same problem with an IBM 120g.	St
1.18.2	I went and pulled it out of the computer, cleaned out the drive cooler of the captured dust bunnies and reinstalled in a different slot.	St
1.18.3	3 months later and still no problems with clicking or drops in performance.	St
1.18.4	BUT...the 60g WD drive is dead.	St
1.18.5	Heat killed it.	St
1.18.6	I did not have a drive cooler installed.	St
1.18.7	Lesson learned here.	St
1.19.1	try tapping the hard drive on start up with a small hammer.	Sug
1.19.2	if it starts up you may have enough time to backup your data good luck	St
1.20.1	from what you said from the one diagnostic you ran, the DATA ON IT is quite likely still good.	St
1.20.2	IF you have one or more local computer repair shops that don't have NATIONAL NAMES on them (we have just two here, and I picked one of them when I had a problem with a drive that had the USB interface fried, but was still running, mechanically), I'd take it to them with a NEW or DIFFERENT external drive with AT LEAST as much free space available as you had OCCUPIED on the &quot;clicking&quot; drive, and ask them if they can find a way to access and copy the data without having to ship it off to some company that uses &quot;clean rooms,&quot; which can run into many HUNDREDS of dollars.	St
1.20.3	In MY case, the drive I had bought for $110 on sale last year around Christmas (discounted from $180), was ALMOST full and I hadn't backed up, but had JUST bought another 250 GB external I hadn't even installed yet, and all the guy had to do was disconnect the drive from its USB interface and connect it to his RAID assembly and copy everything to the NEW 250 GB drive, and all the data was there (I IMMEDIATELY backed up the most important files {pictures I'd taken}) when I got back home -- and it cost me $35 -- WAY LESS than one of the NATIONAL companies would have likely charged, and done in a day or so... Oh, recently I bought a newer compter, which had a spot to add another internal drive, and the same place charged me just another $35 to install that same drive that USED to be an external as an INTERNAL... still works great!	St
1.20.4	(this was AFTER I spent $15 for hardware online to do it, myself, but couldn't get it to work... turned out THAT required some BIOS settings changes and DIP switch changes I had no way of knowing about, lol).	St
1.20.5	Your &quot;clicking&quot; drive may be much more difficult to remedy, however, than one that just lost its interface connection...	St
1.20.6	When I bought the second 250, it was BECAUSE the first one was almost full...	St
1.20.7	Suddenly I was in the &quot;same boat,&quot; since the other one was now in the box again until what I just wrote above happened...	St
1.20.8	But a month or so later, I caught a 600 GB external on sale.	St
1.20.9	Just so happened, my FIRST external was a 120 GB Simpletech I bought at Sam's Club back in 2004, and since I now had PLENTY of HD space, and that drive had LOTS of photos and videos and stuff on it, just for &quot;security,&quot; I decided to do a COMPLETE COPY of that drive to the new one...	St
1.20.10	Within 3 weeks, one day I went to reboot and the 120 GB Simpletech drive just made &quot;clicking sounds.&quot; That's all it's done since.	St
1.20.11	Luckily, I hadn't stored ANYTHING NEW on it in the meantime, as I had A FEELING it was about to go (the case was getting HOTTER than it used to when it ran).	St
1.20.12	I've had it unplugged, sitting in a box, for several months, now, trying to decide if I should just throw it away or maybe give it to someone who might use it for parts.	St
1.20.13	I tried all the &quot;tapping tricks&quot; and so forth, mostly just for my own curiosity, as I knew that was likely it, but all it does is... when I power it up... CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- SHUDDDER... CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- SHUDDDDER...	St
1.20.14	It repeats that a half dozen or so times before it just gives up.	St
1.20.15	That's ALL MECHANICAL -- ALL OF IT!	St
1.20.16	I don't really know drive electronics or mechanics very much, but I think the drive gets to the point where either the heads freeze, or the platter freezes, or both.	St
1.20.17	In all likelihood, all the data on MY drive is still in tact, as well, but since I backed it all up, it's no deal.	St
1.20.18	In YOUR case, it might not be quite as bad...	St
1.20.19	I'd try everything that's been suggested here -- VERY CAREFULLY -- because the things such as TAPPING on the hard drive to try to dislodge whatever's causing the &quot;clicking&quot; COULD, conceivably, also cause a platter crash if you do it too hard and the heads suddenly come crashing down on the platter -- THEN YOU WON'T still have all that data on there.	St
1.20.20	I hadn't thought about freezing a drive before, but the logic behind that makes PERFECT SENSE to me, as does trying to get it to run on a different side, thus changing its center of gravity, and so forth...	St
1.20.21	If the tapping hasn't worked, perhaps tapping, then freezing, then letting it warm up a little bit before you power it up and tapping gently if it still clicks when you turn it on MIGHT.	St
1.20.22	If none of that does it, try finding a local place that services computers, and see what you can find out.	St
1.20.23	Good luck!	St
1.21.1	i had a dvd-drive clicking, and changed to another drive, and still clicking.	St
1.21.2	i figured out the yellow 12 volt cabling did not have enough amperage.	St
1.21.3	i replaced the power supply making sure it had plenty of juice (20 + amps on 12 volt circuit) and voila, the clicking went away.	St
1.21.4	it's also not a bad idea to back up your data to a second hard drive since they don't cost too much these days, and quite easy to install.	St
1.22.1	My hard drive just started making a clicking noise the other day and will not boot up my computer.	St
1.22.2	I get a message that says &quot;alert system fan not detected&quot; press F1 to retry or F2 for setup.	St
1.22.3	Does this mean that my hard drive is fried?	St
1.22.4	What are my options at this time?	Ques
1.23.1	Now it's just a decision to install a new drive and reload from your restore CDs and backup.	St
1.23.2	Bob	St
1.24.1	I've had this problem many times and luckily stumbled across what was causing my hard drives to keep failing...and you won't believe this.	St
1.24.2	I use externels alot and the power connectors that go to your drive widen from frequent removal and so forth causing a small short that will eventually fry your drive board after so many clicks.	St
1.24.3	This click is caused by what I believe to be a short in the power pins to the drive and a simple cure is to tighten the pins and your good to go.	St
1.24.4	I did this and have not heard 1 click since I fixed the power connectors.. Hope this saves every 1 alot of money cause it has me!!!!!!!!!!!!	St
1.24.5	!	St
1.25.1	thanks for your post	Polite
1.26.1	I read with interest your posting about the power pins to the drive.	St
1.26.2	Can you explain to me exactly what I need to check and possibly fix?	St
1.27.1	But I was having the same problem, tried the drive on several computers, downloaded new drivers and was getting ready to shell out the recovery fee when I saw your post.	St
1.27.2	I moved the power tines closer in and Voila!!.	St
1.27.3	I am buying a new drive anyway...too much of a scare.	St
1.27.4	And yeah yeah backup backup I know the drill.	St
1.28.1	Glad I could help you out.	St
1.28.2	After many drives and about 4 years of replacing drives I Stumbled across this trying to fix 1.	St
1.28.3	Found the Power connectors loose on my ide to usb drive, tightened them up and never had a problem again.	St
1.28.4	This can also happen to the pins on the drive too.	St
1.28.5	You can spread them apart for even tighter connections but be carful not to spread to much or the will get caught and bend leaving your drive useless....ENJOY	St
1.29.1	when you connect the power to your drive, inside the end of the power cord that attaches off your power supply, there are female pins and males on the drive itself.	St
1.29.2	Take a needle or something small enough and make the female pins a little smaller so the males have a snug fit..	St
1.29.3	This will stop the drive from shorting out and frying the board on the drive...	St
1.29.4	I have not lost another drive or heard another click since I figured this out..	St
1.29.5	But I check the pins regularly now to make sure they are tight at all times.	St
1.29.6	Hope this helps you out....	St
1.30.1	from the rear of the drive.	St
1.30.2	If not, replace it.	St
1.30.3	Better back up everything you have on it, ASAP.	St
1.30.4	Sound coming from a hard drive is always bad news.	St
1.30.5	Arching does not make a clicking sound it's more of a crackling sound, like bacon frying.	St
1.30.6	Your arm might be dragging on the platter or the bearing maybe going out.	St

1.30.8	Things not starting and stopping smoothly?	St
1.30.9	At times programs slowing down then returning to normal speed?	St
1.30.10	Minor hesitations with no consistent pattern.	St
1.30.11	A very hot hard drive.	St
1.30.12	These are all signs of a hard drive that will soon be scrape.	St
1.30.13	Try a &quot;check disk&quot; and do a &quot;defragmentation&quot;.	St
1.30.14	Sometimes, a very poorly maintained drive can be the problem but doubtful.	St
1.30.15	Fortunately you might be able to &quot;scrub&quot; this drive to insure your privacy before it completely fails.	St

1.34.1	Hi, I just wanted to say THANKS for your post on changing the psu on the external hard drive.	St
1.34.2	My external hard drive that I use to backup my computer started clicking and I was freaking out because all my wife's pictures and 90 gigs of itunes music were also stored on it.	St
1.34.3	I called all these data recovery places and the cheapest was $900.00!	St
1.34.4	I was going to send off the drive and thought I would just google clicking hard drives to see if there might be something I could do on my own.	St
1.34.5	This led me to this forum and your post.	St
1.34.6	I had another external hard drive with the same psu and tried it on the clicking one.	St
1.34.7	IT STARTED RIGHT UP and has been working ever since!	St
1.34.8	UNBELIEVABLE!	St
1.34.9	Needless to say, I am backing all the data up right now and thanks to you, I saved a ton of money!!!!	St
1.34.10	THANKS!	St
1.35.1	Thanks sea4th, your solution worked for me.	St
1.35.2	I had the same issue described in this thread (a wd 320gb drive stop working .. upon startup, drive started spinning ... then click click click .. then shut down .. repeat many times, then screen stating boot drive could not found, press F1 or F2).	St
1.35.3	I replaced the drive, and then tried to recover data from the crashed drive.	St
1.35.4	I tried many things listed in this thread, including (*) trying two different external enclosures to see if the power supply was a problem, (*) tightening/squeezing the power connectors to make sure a solid power connection, (*) tapping the drive with a small hammer lightly while starting up to see if it would un-jam something, (*) twisting and moving the drive around while starting up, and starting it up at different angles, again to see if it would un-jam something.	St
1.35.5	None of this worked.	St
1.35.6	Same click-click-stop.	St
1.35.7	I was about to put it in the freezer for a while (which worked years ago for me on another problem drive), but decided to warm it as my next test.	St
1.35.8	I put it in a toaster oven at low temperature (160 degrees) for 30 minutes .. assuming this would be low enough to not damage anything, and warm enough to expand metal to mimic a longer-running hard drive; selected 30 minutes to allow all parts to heat up.	St
1.35.9	I connected the drive, and it worked ... suprised, but there it was .. external drive was recognized.	St
1.35.10	I quickly copied important files, then copied the entire drive, and then shut the problem drive down and will use it as a door stop.	St
1.35.11	Again, thanks sea4th for the heating suggestion.	Polite
1.36.1	I just had this problem with my Seagate Freeagent 1.5 TB external drive this evening.	St
1.36.2	If you have multiple interface options, try switching to another one, or checking the first.	St
1.36.3	My ESata cable came loose, but wasn't disconnected.	St
1.36.4	I switched to firewire and the drive worked fine.	St
1.36.5	Then I tried hooking it back up to the ESata after I had reseated the cord in the port.	St
1.36.6	Worked fine again.	Polite
1.36.7	Still, back up your data.	St
1.36.8	This was a huge scare for me because all my photographs for the last 10 years are archived on this drive.	St
1.36.9	Fortunately, I only would have lost a couple months, but still...	St
1.36.10	Backup is your friend.	St
1.37.1	When you hear clicking or grinding in your hard drive immediately power the drive down.	St
1.37.2	Continued use can result in damage to your platters.	St
1.37.3	Platter or Media Damage can result in your data being unrecoverable.	St
1.37.4	If your data is important I would take the drive into a Professional Data Recovery Firm like http://www.24hourdata.com They will offer a Free Quote & a No Data, No Charge policy.	St
1.38.1	I just discovered that I had this problem about two hours ago on a drive in an (older)external enclosure, I transferred the drive to a (newer)spare external enclosure, and was able to bring it back online, suffice to say that I am now transferring my data off that (old)drive to a new drive, and will recycle the (old)drive.	St
1.39.1	Clicking sound can sometimes be due to lack of power either within the PC power supply or via USB (some USB does not provide enuff pwr).	St
1.39.2	you should also check the drive for damages using the drive's internal smart log'g.	Sug
1.39.3	u can see the logs with these software.	Sug
1.39.4	they're free.	St
1.39.5	i keep the aeo3 app in my thumbdrives.	St
1.39.6	Aeo3 HD Smart http://aeo3.com/apps/hdsmart/index.html Speedfan http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php	St
1.40.1	I have been reading the posts on clicking and no booting hard drives.	St
1.40.2	Don't ask me where my back up files are, as I bought the thumb drive tow months ago to do it, but I couldn't figure out how!	St
1.40.3	Techno-tard.	St
1.40.4	So how do I determine what new hard drive to get?	Ques
1.40.5	And what do I do?	St
1.40.6	Kathy	St
1.41.1	It appears you are just starting off in trying to repair your own machine.	St
1.41.2	There are plenty of web pages about How do I replace my hard drive?	St
1.41.3	That you can find and read with google.	St
1.41.4	Try that.	St
1.41.5	As to which hard drive, there are many choices today.	St
1.41.6	For simple, replace with same size and interface.	St
1.41.7	For those that want to try upgrading they do that.	St
1.41.8	Bob	St
1.42.1	I have a Maxtor DiamondMax 10 internal drive that all of a sudden starting making a clicking and grinding sound.	St
1.42.2	And of course it was a drive that had 3 years of customers files and rip files for printing large formatt jobs.	St
1.42.3	We had a backup copy but I found out the person who was in charge of the rip station stop doing the backup over a year ago.	St
1.42.4	So I started my research of what I could do.	St
1.42.5	.	St
1.42.6	.	St
1.42.7	that when I came across a video link on YouTube of PCB Solutions on how to fix a hard drive.	St
1.42.8	Well after watching the video and going to their website onepcsolutions.com and found the board for the hardrive I had and order it with a rush delivery.	St
1.42.9	Next day I had the board (cost $39.95 plus shipping) and I had the board from B.C.	St
1.42.10	Canada in just one day to Tampa Florida area.	St
1.42.11	It came with the tool needed to replace the drive board and within minutes it was up and running so I could do a 100% backup.	St
1.42.12	I never lost a single job!	St
1.42.13	They are life savers!!!	St
1.42.14	Hope this helps someone else!	St
1.42.15	Rick Courtier	St
1.43.1	In addition to them any ideas here, this worked for me.	St
1.43.2	Inside my HP Pavilion was a Toshiba HD.	St
1.43.3	It started clicking and would not longer boot.	St
1.43.4	I also couldn't access it from a boot disk.	St
1.43.5	So I removed the drive and installed it in a Rocketfish external enclosure.	St
1.43.6	Amazingly, it is working fine and I am able to copy off my important files (iTunes!).	St
1.43.7	I won't be counting on the drive to last though.	St
1.43.8	Give an external enclosure a shot.	St
1.43.9	One thing is for sure, the clicking crashed HD is not a certain death sentence.	St
1.44.1	Thanks to ea4th and confirmation by bdocko - My WD 2500 drive defied spinrite and another windows data recover tool mentioned here.	St
1.44.2	No matter what I tried, it just refused to boot and would sit there clicking.	St
1.44.3	Ten minutes in a toaster oven at 150 deg made it bootable again!!!	St
1.44.4	Cheers!	St
1.44.5	!	St
1.45.1	OMG I can't believe this actually worked!	St
1.45.2	I tapped the drive with the back of my screwdriver saying &quot;bad drive!&quot;.	St
1.45.3	Next attempt to boot it gave one click and then booted properly!	St
1.45.4	WTF!	St
1.46.1	I too ran into a dead end with a clicking DELL laptop HD.	St
1.46.2	Spinrite and HDD Regenerator both failed to even see the clicking drive.	St
1.46.3	I stuck the drive in the toaster oven for about 5 mins at it's lowest temp setting figuring I would try small increments of time and temp to lower the risk of adding any physical damage to the HD...but voila!	St
1.46.4	It worked first shot out of the oven!	St
1.46.5	Great tip!!	St
1.46.6	I was able to recover 100's of digital camera images that had not been backed up yet at the time the clicking began.	St
1.46.7	Thanks sea4th for the suggestion and bdocko &amp; dataquest2 for the supporting data points that prompted me to try this unorthodox method.	St
1.47.1	I'm going to second the opinion of others and say there isn't anything you can do to fix things at home.	St
1.47.2	DO NOT smack the drive as some suggest.	St
1.47.3	If you rattle the plates or dislocate the heads, you have huge problems.	St
1.47.4	Also, do NOT try to open it up yourself to replace anything.	Sug
1.47.5	We have a guy in house who does that in a clean room, and he's been doing it for 30 years, so he can get in and out with no problems.	St
1.47.6	If you've never done it, though, you are MUCH more likely to damage the drive further than actually fix anything.	St
1.47.7	That said, if the drive is clicking, about 6 times out of 10 it is a bad PCB.	St
1.47.8	It can be replaced, but it won't be cheap.	St
1.47.9	Local shops can usually do it for about 400-500, but a big name national shop will run you at least a grand.	St
1.47.10	The worse scenario is if your heads are damaged or misaligned.	St
1.47.11	That'll run you $600-700 and up depending on the complexity of the drive and how bad it is.	St
1.47.12	Best case scenario is there is something wrong with the drive motor, which can be fixed relatively easily.	St
1.47.13	Check out some local computer repair shops and see what they tell you, but know that it'll cost you.	St
