750i chipset is only for core2duo/quad.
for core i7 920 you'll need a mobo with an x58 chipset but they're generally $200CAD and higher.
suggest you consider a core i7-860 ($330CAD) and a gigabyte ga-p55 or msi p55 ($120CAD).
a single radeon hd 5850 $290CAD will be comparable to dual gtx 260 and run cooler.
if you must have dual 260s, an sli-enabled p55 mobo will be about $25 due to the nvidia license fee.
