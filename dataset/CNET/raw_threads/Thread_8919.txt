Yesterday I noticed the Desktop clock began slowing down. I installed a new CMOS battery, checked BIOS settings and restarted. Now the system and programs run faster and more dependable than in the passed year and system resources hold up better. It's a 4 1/2 year old Gateway 800 running the OEM Windows ME. Could the new CMOS battery be the cause of the sudden upgrade in performance? Not complaining, just curious.

The CMOS battery does hold bios info setting and if they started not act accordingly it could cause a problem, but its not suppose to as long as battery life is present even if weak. It should really start to fail, not slow down and usually a slow clock is the result and nothing else, excluding any other reference to &quot;timing&quot;. If the timing is wholly dependant then yes, because the clock cycles take longer and in fact allow the system to slow down, as the system is dependant on those &quot;cycle rates&quot;. Its logic at it worse, working but not at the rated value. good luck -----Willy

When you put in a new battery and checked the bios settings the bios program may have scaned every thing and did a &quot;refresh&quot; of the settings for clock speed memeory speed etc. So now it's back at a perfomrance setting. But with out knowing the pc make and bios type it's haed to tell. John

At least my experience with ME has been a nightmare. I had it for a few months when it first came out then went back to W98.
