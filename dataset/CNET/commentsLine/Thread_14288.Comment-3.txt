to run those applications simultaneously, you need: a professional graphic card the like nvidia quadro nvs280 or fx500 or ati firegl (128 nvidia ti4200 is maily design for 3d game applications), and 2 or 3 identical harddisks in raid 0 or raid 5 configuration, (for speedy data transfer between data processing and storage subsystem, as these graphic application uses a large tempfile and stored it in harddisk as scratchdisk.
eg.
while composing an a0-size poster in photoshop, the tempfile can be blotted to more than 1 gb, and you need to partition your hd into several drives around 20-40gb each), and 1536 mb ram is the minimun.
