Is it possible, using Xgrid to speed up the CPU intensive tasks? If I have a Macbook and an iMac, and I edited the video on and now I want to bur a DVD so can I use xgrid to use the Macbooks power as well? For a simple setup like this, what wires would necessary to carry this out? Any other stuff? And while the DVD is burning and say someone comes home late at night with his Macbook Pro, so can he also add his idle laptop to the xgrid for the night to speed up the DVD burning? In this way I could run a setup as powerful or even more powerful than a Mac Pro.

You need an X-Serve running 10.4 server and your clients also need to be running 10.4 The Xgrid controller, built in to 10.4 server will control all the tasks and will dole out portions of a job to whatever clients are in the cluster. It also collects finished tasks and sends out retries for failures. All the participating machines need to be connected to an ethernet (faster) network. Google for Xgrid, lots of hits, or go to the Apple site, www.apple.com/acg/xgrid for more information P
