I've read from various articles that if a host on a network wants to talk with another host it must have the destination host's MAC address.
How come it is not sufficient for the requesting host to just have the destination host's IP address?
After all, the IP address itself already uniquely identifies the host on the network, so why is it necessary for the requesting host to know the physical identifier of the destination host to initiate a communication?
