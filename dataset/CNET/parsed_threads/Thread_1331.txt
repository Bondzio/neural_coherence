<s> I have a new E521 Dimension desktop with a 19&quot; ultrasharp digital monitor. </s>
<s> I upgraded to a GeForce 7900GT graphics card. </s>
<s> When I play back slide shows made with Windows movie maker and/or Proshow Gold, I get terrible image quality on any photos that are in motion. </s>
<s> I don't see this when my screen saver kicks in and uses the same pictures that are in the slide show. </s>
<s> It's hard to explain what it looks like, but it's kind of a flickering. </s>
<s> Any vertical or horizontal lines seem to look the worst, but I can see a very digital looking effect on all of the pictures. </s>
<s> Water looks like is moving along with everything else. </s>
<s> Any idea what causes this. </s>
<s> I've tried changing resolution, cleartype, refresh rate and much more that I can't remember. </s>
<s> Anyone else seeing this? </s>
<s> Or know a fix? </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> When we create content with MM, it should degrade the video to what is known as 480p which is OK for TV sets but would look ratty on a PC display. </s>

<s> ?? </s>
<s> Does this mean there is no fix to this? </s>
<s> I hate to think I paid $150.00 extra for a 19&quot; Ultra sharp monitor, and ended up with terrible slideshow images. </s>
<s> What is MM (multi-media?) </s>
<s> The output of movie maker is for TVs. </s>
<s> Specifically bad old ratty NTSC/PAL TVs with 480p. </s>
<s> Your PC monitor is well beyond that and why it looks terrible with this old software. </s>
<s> I see ProShow Gold now has HD quality output. </s>
