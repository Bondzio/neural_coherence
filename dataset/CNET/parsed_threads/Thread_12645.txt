<s> This D-Link DI-624 router is driving me nuts. </s>
<s> It disconects and reconects after 10 minutes or so of being solidly connected at 54Mbs. </s>
<s> Right now it is actually disconnected. </s>
<s> Now it came back up the bars in my task bar are green and connected while the disconnected wireless network has a cross in it. </s>
<s> How can one thing say it is connected while the other contradicts it? </s>
<s> If I disable windows firewall it connects to the network, only to disconnect a while later. </s>
<s> If I enable windows firewall the same thing happens. </s>
<s> Everything is contradicting something else. </s>
<s> I have reseted the router a couple of times to its factory default but the same things happen again. </s>
<s> It was working fine last night. </s>
<s> My LAN is working with no problems. </s>
<s> I have had this router for a week now and I wish I had not bought it. </s>
<s> update then run your spyware scans. </s>
<s> Dropped connections can be a side effect of the little vermin. </s>
<s> I have run all scans there are to be run. </s>
<s> I was just on the phone with these guys from D-Link support they have reseted and tweaked my settings. </s>
<s> It seems to work a little better, but when I activate the WEP security mode it seems to be going the same old problem. </s>
<s> I can't rely on an open system to run my wireless connection. </s>
<s> It seems to me very strange that this was not happening for the first week I have had this router. </s>
<s> How come all of a sudden it began doing this nonsense. </s>
<s> checks out OK, that leaves a hardware issue. </s>
<s> If the problem persists on another PC that is known to have no issues, then the router becomes the primary suspect. </s>
<s> I would try another brand. </s>
