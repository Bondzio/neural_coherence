check tomshardware at the link below.
the other thing you need to keep in mind is the power supply (psu) in your existing system.
generally speaking, the faster the video card, the more power (read psu) it needs to run it.
might want to check what psu your system has.
by checking the psu, you should be able to figure out roughly what video card you can install without getting a new psu too.
it may end up you'll need a more robust psu anyway.
