if cd boot fails then that is caused by &quot;something else.&quot; i noted dban but i can remove partitons with gnome tools too.
maybe the issue you haven't pulled the trigger on this?
some fall into analysis paralysis.
or want an authoritive answer, a manual, step by step, etc.
i can only be clear on one thing.
if i can't boot a cd, it's not due to what's on or not on the hard disk.
