i am replacing the power source on an hp computer.
had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection.
can i buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do i need to return the power source.
the power source is smaller in size than usual (thanks hp) and finding a replacement has not been easy.
thanks for any info you may have.
