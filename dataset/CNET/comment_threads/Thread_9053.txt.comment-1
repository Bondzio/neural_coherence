Can anyone suggest a good Movie Maker that will play a song in the INTRO all the way thur?
I had Roxio on my old computer, and it was great had no problems.
I broke down a got the Easy CD&DVD Burning (Roxio).....well guess you get what you pay for, I hated it, just a played short intro song, but even so it was a lame program, I uninstalled.
Window's Movie maker just plays a short intro,about a verse and starts over.
Any other Movie Maker program anyone can suggest, don't know if I want to go back to using Roxio products, the reviews are not to good, especially for Vista users.
Any help would be appreciated.
