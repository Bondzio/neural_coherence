<s> I'm having a problem receiving more than a 54mbps feed from the DIR625 on my Toshiba A210-JA3 laptop. </s>
<s> The Atheros card seems to top out at 54mbps on the feed (excellent signal), compared to the D-Link USB adapter (hockey puck) that pulls in a constant 300mbps (very good signal) in the same location. </s>
<s> Limited interference (moved the baby monitor, microwave rarely operational); so that isn't a factor. </s>
<s> I've downloaded the most recent Atheros drivers from the Toshiba site but the Atheros card only will work when the DIR-625 is set to mixed G/N mode, and then only picks up the router as a G. The D-Link adapter on the Lenovo 3000 desktop works regardless of the mode. </s>
<s> Is there something I might be missing on the D-Link end? </s>
<s> I've checked for updates online and nothing pops out. </s>
<s> I'd love to get the laptop working at 300mbps as I run the entire house wirelessly based on the strange location of our cable modem (Motorola on Shaw Cable). </s>
<s> The modem is fine (just swapped in last Friday) so I've eliminated that as a potential problem. </s>
<s> You have both companies to make this call to. </s>
<s> Make sure nothing is &quot;Pre-N&quot;. </s>
