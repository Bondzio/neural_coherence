Ok, those are two of the best cards around.
I personally have a Geforce 9800 512 MB and it runs great, I play CODWAW, Simcity Socitites, Age of Empires III, and many other graphic heavy games and i can run all my games on max quality with no lag.
(Mind you that I custom build my machine and i run 64 bit windows 7 rc) However i think that the Geforce 9500 1 GB card might be better because it has more dedicated graphics memory, and it should be able to play games for many more years to come.
