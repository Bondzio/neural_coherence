you've paired a high-end mobo, high-end cpu, with a mid-range video card and low-end ram.
if you don't plan on SLI, don't get an SLI mobo.
an asus p5q pro is nearly half the price and will perform better.
if you do plan on SLI in the future, an asus p5n-d (based on 750i chipset which doesn't have the flaky issues of the 780i) is a better choice.
the 3ghz q9650 won't improve your gaming experience much when compared to a 2.8 q9550, but the q9550 should save you at least $200CAD.
use the money you saved to upgrade to a radeon hd 4870 or geforce gtx 260 and 2x2gb ddr2-1066.
you'll should still wind up saving at least $150CAD but have a faster gaming rig.
