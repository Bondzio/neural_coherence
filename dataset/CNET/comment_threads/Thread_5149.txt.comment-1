i have accidentally lifted the lever seating my cpu while working on my pc.
I put the lever back down.
Will i need to properly seat my cpu again with thermal paste or will it be ok. everything seems to be working fine but i can't help thinking it is a little slower or am i just being paranoid!?
Idle core temp is 52 deg c 125F on an AMD 64 3000+ with standard heatsink and fan on an MSI K8N Neo motherboard.
Don't know what the temp was before.
Sorry.
