in your usb drive.it is available as a free download.
if your usb drive supports u3 standard then you can also use some u3 standard portable sw in your drive.
the advantage is that all the registry entries in the pc in which you use your u3 drive with portable sw are deleted when you remove the usb drive, thus leaving the pc in its previous state.
ie7 does not have a portable version.
