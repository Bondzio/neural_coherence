Boot up into the BIOS screen.
This is done by pressing the DEL key, but it varies from system to system and is shown on your post screen as you are booting up.
Check to see if the WOL option (Wakeup On Lan) is enabled.
There is also may be a modem ring option....disable that if it is enabled.
See if that helps.
