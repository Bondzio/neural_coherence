i use linux and freebsd which is a unix variant.
i also use minix and plan9, both are unix variants also.
again, no manufacturer makes windows, they install it.
i only know of ibm, sun, and hp as being both manufacturers and devlopers of software systems; and, even then, the machines have to have the system installed.
the article points to linux using this feature since 2000.the feature is not new.
