<s> Hello everyone. </s>
<s> I have a wireless router problem and have spent hours on customer service with dell, linksys, and at&t. </s>
<s> I am desperate for help. </s>
<s> I have a dell desktop and dell xps 1530 laptop, and dsl service through at&t. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a linksys wrt310n router and could not get it running with help from all 3 customer service reps. </s>
<s> It was determined that the router was bad and I returned it in exchange for a linksys wrt160n. </s>
<s> I have set the router up. </s>
<s> My laptop says it is connected (local and ineternet), but every time I open ie it says webpage cannot be displayed. </s>
<s> When I run the check for problem it displays &quot;cannot communicate with dsn server 192.168.1.254&quot; The desktop is connected via the dsl modem and router and can access the internet fine. </s>
<s> Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Can you connect using the wired Ethernet port? </s>
<s> Do you know where the mentioned IP address comes from? </s>
<s> Modem or router? </s>
<s> It looks a bit suspicious. </s>
<s> As for connection settings, are you doing these manually or automatically? </s>
<s> Hello! </s>

<s> make sure your computer is directly connected to the router Step 1: Shutdown the computer. </s>
<s> Step 2: reset the router while power on then Unplug the routers power cable. </s>
<s> Step 3: Unplug the Broadband modems power cable and wait for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Step 4: Plug in the Broadband modems power cable and wait for its lights to appear stable. </s>
<s> Step 5: Plug in the router's power cable once the modems lights appear stable. </s>
<s> Step 6: Power on the computer on and check internet connection. </s>
<s> If you still have no internet connection, access the router setup page and configure the router settings; change the router LAN IP address to 192.168.2.1, set the connection type to PPPoE and manually type yoour att username (in email format) and password, save settings. </s>
<s> Go to the router setup page and click on the connect button Step 7: test the Internet connection once the status indicates connected and IP address show up if this still didnot work, upgrade the firmware of your router and repeat the same steps. </s>
<s> note: configuring the router settings will depends who is your provider. </s>
<s> if your isp is dsl you need to configure your ISP username (email address format) and password on the router. </s>
<s> if your router is a cable no need to change any settings on the router. </s>
<s> it should automatically work </s>
<s> Then click start, run or hit the Windows key and the R key at the same time. </s>
<s> This will bring up run. </s>
<s> Type cmd hit enter type ipconfig /all (space between the g and /) hit enter Look for the default gateway. </s>
<s> Put that number in the address bar. </s>
<s> Log into the Linksys Router. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID Use WPA-PSK(TKIP) Security Mixed b and g mode(n if available) Use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Most wireless devices work best on these channels. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> Power everything off for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Now power everything back on. </s>
<s> Try and connect. </s>
