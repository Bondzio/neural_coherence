1.1.1	Hi , Can somebody help me please , I have a Toshiba PX1265SE-1G16 external hard drive , it has onspec regen in stalled on what I think is a virtual drive , the only problem is is that when I enter the password for the drive , it says that the drive is enabled but when I go to my computer , it is only showing up as a cd drive with only 19.7 mb .	St
1.1.2	the drive itself is 200gb .	St
1.1.3	I have loads of pictures and files on there which i do not want to loose .	St
1.1.4	can anybody help ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is there a way of removing the virtual cd drive , thus allowing me access to my files ?	Ques
1.1.6	I am running windows 7 on a Samsung NC10 .	St
1.1.7	thank you .	Polite
1.2.1	It 's their software and if they fail , then the next call is to http : //www.drivesavers.com - & gt ; All externals fail like this .	St
1.2.2	These are not & quot ; storage & quot ; but temporary copies which we must backup .	St
1.2.3	For those that do n't backup because it costs too much , just wait till they see the data recovery bills .	St

1.3.1	I appreciate the advice , but I do n't think it 's a hardware issue , I just think that either the mbr or virtual drive has become corrupt .	St
1.3.2	I can not delete anything as it will not give me access , It says it 's a network drive .	St
1.3.3	any ideas ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks again .	St

1.4.1	The problem is that this virtual drive is non-standard .	St
1.4.2	If you use some non-standard feature then you need to ask Toshiba how to recover .	St
1.4.3	AT THE TOP OF THIS FORUM ARE THE USUAL TITLES TO TRY but if you value your files I must stick to my original advice .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Managed to find a piece of software called CD to HDD converter .	St
1.5.2	It converts to a hdd again , but you will have to then use a file recovery software to get back your files because it formats ( quick ) you hdd .	St
1.6.1	My bet is they get that call too often and may have a fix that does not create the need for file recovery .	St
1.6.2	- & gt ; But this is the lesson that these drives are not storage .	St
1.6.3	We must have a backup copy of what we ca n't lose .	St
