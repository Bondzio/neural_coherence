I have a D-Link DI-624 802.11g AirPlus Xtreme G 108 Mbps Wireless Router. Recently, we've been having problems with random connection loses. One thing that I have experimented, is that if I have a PC that generates a lot of web requests it will make every PC in the office lose their connection. Is there a business oriented wireless router that can be configured as easy as the D-Link DI-624. Please no Cisco solutions.
