<s> Well, it's that time of the year to format and redo for me. </s>
<s> My usual back up drive is a WD Passport USB 80GB drive, I use it constantly. </s>
<s> Today I was dumb and formatted it and tried to install Leopard on it and couldn't get it running. </s>
<s> So after that I try to go back into Windows and format it so I can use it as a backup again and it didn't show up in my computer. </s>
<s> I did the obvious and replugged it in and got an unknown device what ever, so I told it to look for drives but it couldn't find any. </s>
<s> At this point I'm freaking out, so I pull up device manager and see the unknown device, but it's also under Disk Drives, working properly. </s>
<s> I then plugged it into my XP desktop, works like a charm, shows up, works fine, read/write/copy, everything, so no problems with the drive. </s>
<s> I think I've cornered it to a driver problem in Windows, and don't know what to do now. </s>
<s> Anyone have an idea? </s>
<s> Installing Windows on your Mac requires a special procedure and only certain versions will install. </s>
<s> If this is a PC then this post is heeded to be locked since we can't discuss pirated material. </s>

<s> No, I have Windows under Bootcamp on my Mac. </s>
<s> I was using the drive with Time Machine AND to backup files from Vista. </s>
<s> We have a great moderator that can address this there. </s>
