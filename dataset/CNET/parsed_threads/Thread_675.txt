<s> I have purchased another xbox 360 for the living room to use with windows media center and netflix. </s>
<s> It is connected via a xbox wireless adapter(802.11b/g). </s>
<s> When I stream netflix the quality is terrible which defeats its purpose. </s>
<s> My router is a netgear wireless-n WNR834Bv2. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of connecting the xbox via ethernet instead to a linksys WGA600N dual band wireless-n gaming adapter. </s>
<s> Will the linksys adapter give me 802.11n speeds? </s>
<s> Will just upgrading my router(I've read negative reviews) provide better performance? </s>
<s> I also will be getting a ps3 for xmas and would like to set it up wireless. </s>
<s> I was thinking about purchasing another router that would support 802.11n with gigabit lan(WNR832Bv2 doesn't have gigabit lan) and use the netgear as a wireless bridge. </s>
<s> So my other xbox 360 and main computer will be connected via ethernet to the new router. </s>
<s> In the living room the ps3 and xbox 360 would connect to the netgear bridge via ethernet. </s>
<s> I also have a laptop that will be connected wireless. </s>
<s> Will i get N speed between the routers? </s>
<s> Is this a better alternative then using 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapter? </s>
<s> I really don't want to go through the hassle of running 2 new network cables to the xbox and ps3. </s>
<s> But I also don't want to waste money buying 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapters or another router to bridge and still suffer from poor connection speeds. </s>
<s> Then end up running wires instead. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> I'm also open to any other suggestions. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> I'll let others answer your question but I went with a refurb 25 buck WGPS606 and the 360 and PC on the other end work fine. </s>
<s> I liked it so much I bought a second unit. </s>
<s> Since 802.11g is over 10 times faster than my cable internet connection I found no reason to consider 802.11n Bob </s>
