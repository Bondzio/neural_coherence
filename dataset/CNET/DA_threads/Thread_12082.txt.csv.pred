1.1.1	i know a shredder is n't a true peripheral but it SHOULD be in every office , so .	St
1.1.2	.	St
1.1.3	.	St
1.1.4	I had a GBC shredder that worked okay for a year or so before dying , and these royals I see on ebay are not well reviewed .	St
1.1.5	I want something that will handle all those credit card offers without having to open them .	St
1.1.6	-- and erase CD 's too .	St
1.1.7	any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.8	thanks !	Polite

1.2.1	I happen to visit OfficeMax and Office Depot today and gezzz , I did n't know they had so many & quot ; shedders & quot ; now .	St
1.2.2	These are n't the little basic shedders neither that you can place atop a trash can , but come far better in motor and cutter ability .	St
1.2.3	They offer to cut those plastic and Cds as well provided you pay enough for such a model .	St
1.2.4	I just looked them over , I was n't interested but thought to mention it .	St
1.2.5	The local stores here has at least 7-8 different models to review .	St
1.2.6	Check them out first hand rather than a catalog or such .	St
1.2.7	But , I 'm sure those with large amp motors ( specs ) tend to work better ( IMHO ) .	St
1.2.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	Whatever you get , make sure its a crosscut shredder .	St
1.3.2	The ones that just cut into narrow strips are insecure .	St
1.3.3	Fry 's a month or so ago had one on special , a & quot ; Tech KO & quot ; for $ 15 and I got it .	St
1.3.4	Works fine and while I have never tried a CD , it does fine on a credit card .	St
1.3.5	I am not sure it can take a whole CC offer unopened though as its rated 5 sheets at a time and the envelope plus 1 folded page whould be 5 thicknesses .	St
1.3.6	I do n't bother shredding the whole CC offer , just the one page you return to get the card which is usually the one page with my name/address on it .	St
1.3.7	The rest goes in my paper recycle box .	St
