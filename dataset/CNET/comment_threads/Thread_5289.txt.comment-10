eax 2.0 is the minimum spec.
just like with video cards, dx 9.0b/c my be the minimum spec but the game engine can choose an optimized path for specific hardware (e.g.
: different shader model depending on the card).
same with eax.
but discussing this with you is pointless since you have your opinion and won't be changing it anytime soon.
my only issue is that you just rail on and on with your opinion and don't back it up with any other citations.
i don't give an opinion... i give advice and back it up with citations from other sources.
hopefully anyone looking for a sound card (or any other hardware) will make their purchase decision based on information from a variety of sources rather than just a disgruntled opinion.
