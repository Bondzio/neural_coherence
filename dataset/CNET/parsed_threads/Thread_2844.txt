<s> Somebody please help!!! </s>
<s> My computer will not de-fragment!! </s>
<s> I have no idea why..... </s>
<s> The most common cause for this is there is one or more pgms. </s>
<s> already running in the bkgrd. </s>
<s> doing thier tasks, thus the defragger repeats when in conflict. </s>
<s> I suggest you hit the Clt+Alt+Del keys once and see what's running, and kill the tasks not required(leave MS ones) for the time being and allow the defragger a chance to finish. </s>
<s> You can also, check the &quot;startup&quot; of files to see if you can disable during such defragging. </s>
<s> If your systemtray is more than 3-4 icons present, check them to disable, try one at a time for best operation. </s>
<s> Check into areas... good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> You didn't note the OS plus what HARDWARE issue you feel may be affecting this. </s>
<s> Hint: You posted in the &quot;PC Hardware Forum.&quot; For Windows 9x/ME this article covers it all -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/?id=222469 This applies to defragmenting as well as scandisk. </s>
<s> What I often see is any number of responses that contain bits and pieces of what's in this article, but why not have it all. </s>
<s> In closing, if you feel this is a hardware issue, tell about what hardware issue you have. </s>
