<s> My pc is not booting up at all (not even the bios screen). </s>
<s> When I turn on the power, the hard drive starts, I can see all the fans and leds in the case turn on, but nothing else happens. </s>
<s> I tested the power supply with a device I bought a while ago and it shows it's working fine. </s>
<s> I tried replacing the video card thinking maybe I was just not getting a signal through, but that didn't help either. </s>
<s> There's no lose connectors, I've checked them all one at a time. </s>
<s> And finally, from an old article I had read, I tried manually resetting the BIOS. </s>
<s> On a side note, what had led me to believe that it could be a failing power supply, was that the cd drives are not responding to the eject button either. </s>
<s> So what else could be causing this, did my motherboard just die on me? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help. </s>
<s> The dead PC and how to trouble shoot is widely discussed. </s>
<s> The method I use is in the top 10 at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=THE+DEAD+PC&btnG=Google+Search </s>
<s> After going through them, short of using a POST card, if I've disconnected everything on the motherboard as described in the troubleshooting steps, and I still don't get anything but a black screen, at this point should I assume it's the motherboard? </s>
<s> (The RAM is fine, I put it in a different pc and it was sorking) </s>
<s> One of the methods is stripping it down to just motherboard, PSU, CPU, heatsink and speaker. </s>
<s> No beeps = we are looking at the 4 possible bad parts. </s>

<s> You need to share every tiny detail. </s>
<s> One member didn't tell me the power wouldn't come on. </s>
<s> If the power comes on, make sure the CMOS battery is good. </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> Use a voltmeter. </s>
<s> I can't guess what's the right reading without you sharing the model of said battery. </s>
