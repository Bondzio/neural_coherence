Would the XFX PV-T96O-YHFC GeForce 9600 GSO 512MB 128-bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support Video Card be compitable with the Inspiron 530S system?

Here's a link to the card which has now sold out because it had a MIR which made the final cost only $14.95. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150570&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;AID=10440897&amp;PID=4328635&amp;SID=
