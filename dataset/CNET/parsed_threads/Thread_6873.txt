<s> I require a CPU for my Gigabyte GA-7VAXP computer, it needs to be at least over a 3.0 Ghz at least and needs to clock at the same as a 3 Ghz pentium 4. </s>
<s> I've looked at the documentation for my MoBo but it only list AMD CPU's and there aren't many that are fast, i'd search in google but i can't get accurate results and am not sure what to type in. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I had that setup some time ago. </s>
<s> You do have a dated system and YES its AMD cpu based. </s>
<s> NO, you can't install a Intel cpu. </s>
<s> In other words, your system mtrbd. </s>
<s> is old and supports only AMD cpus. </s>
<s> AND that is all it will do plus the AMD cpus you may need to get the best out it are historical. </s>
<s> You have to look in eBay, Craigslist etc. </s>
<s> to find anything that may work or used period. </s>
<s> You'll be better served if you stop any major upgrades and get your hands on a newer mtrbd.. </s>
<s> It needn't be actually new but better h/w wise to accept Intel cpu(you want that?) </s>
<s> and be open to what you want to do. </s>
<s> Find a Intel based mtrbd. </s>
<s> that has 775 socket to accept P4(single core) as your best bet. </s>
<s> Otherwise, dual core mtrbds. </s>
<s> are the next step up and far more capable than a plain P4 and able to grow abit too. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> yeah, i was thinking of buying a new MoBo, and its funny because i found one already, but i wanted to know if my current one was capable of what i asked. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Socket A (athlon XP/ athlon/ duron); if you can find one. </s>
<s> I doubt it would meet your specification. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_Athlon_XP_models#Athlon_XP_.22Barton.22_.28Model_10.2C_130_nm.29 There was never a socket A CPU that came close to your requirements. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> GA-7VAXP is very old. </s>
<s> I think you want to buy a new motherboard. </s>
