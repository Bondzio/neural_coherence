1.1.1	A similar drive worked fine in my old computer with WindowsXP , and I know it is working , but when I go into disc management to format the drive , the drive does not show up so I can begin the process .	St
1.1.2	I 'm using a USB 2.0 cable .	St
1.2.1	We had a very long discussion about a Lacie compatibility issue .	St
1.2.2	It was not a hardware issue then but this does sound like a hardware issue .	St
1.2.3	Your post is a little short on details .	St

1.3.1	Hi Bob- I was n't in on the compatibilty issue discussion you had about Lacie drives .	St
1.3.2	All I know is I have 4 of these Lacie Extreme 256gb drives and I have used one in my wife 's Dell that has XP and used the same drive last year in my old computer with XP ( and it worked ) but it does NOT work in my new computer with WIndows7 .	St
1.3.3	The Lacie drive turns on when I plug into my new computer with the 2.0 USB , it just does not show up when I get into the & quot ; Disc Management & quot ; mode so I can not format it .	St
1.3.4	The new computer , an Antaeus , is a very fast and powerful machine with loads of memory and RAM and works like a champ on everything else .	St
1.3.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanks -- Dave	St
1.4.1	My first test is another machine .	St
1.4.2	Something like HP/Dell , etc with a factory load of 7 .	St
1.4.3	I 've run into too many built machines that have issues .	St
1.4.4	There 's also some issues with USB 3.0 ports but I ca n't guess if that 's a factor .	St
1.4.5	Since it does not show in Disk Management we look at the hardware .	St
1.4.6	And if it 's some custom install of Windows we go over their install procedure .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 'll unplug it and try it in my Dell Windows7 laptop today .	St
1.5.2	Thanks , Bob !	St
