<s> I have internet through cable provided by Comcast. </s>
<s> Ever since it's installation I am unable to get wireless access to my IBM R51 laptop (windows xp), although LAN works perfectly. </s>
<s> I have NETGEAR cable modem gateway CG814WG v2. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to connect wireless, it initially shows that it's connected followed by the message &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. </s>
<s> However, the wireless works perfectly in my other DELL notebook. </s>
<s> Please help me find a solution. </s>
<s> the message limited or no connectivity, Did you try clicking on the message. </s>
<s> Then click on the repair button. </s>
<s> Be paitent, it may give you another error message but if you wait a minute longer, it might connect. </s>
<s> If it does, then type command ipconfig /flushdns then hit enter then close the window. </s>
<s> Before you shut down the computer, disable the radio. </s>
<s> I found that when the radio is NOT disabled, I got that error message often. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> After clicking on repair it says it is unable to &quot;disable the wireless adapter&quot; and to &quot;check wireless network settings&quot;. </s>
<s> I don't know what to check in my settings. </s>
<s> Is there some way to disable my previous settings and set up the whole thing again? </s>
