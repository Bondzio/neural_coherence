<s> Hi Everybody Here is the scenario: I was trying to remove the pre-installed Windows 8. </s>
<s> I figured I should create a backup in case I ever have to go back to the piece of junk software. </s>
<s> Anyway, I plugged-in my external hard drive to make the backup... </s>
<s> Here's the **ck up: It said 'formatting drive'. </s>
<s> Within two seconds, I cancelled the operation and removed the hard drive. </s>
<s> Now, when I try to access it (tried on 3 other laptops), it just shows the Hard Drive as Recovery Disk with some 20MB data and total 30 GB space. </s>
<s> Disk management shows 890 GB unallocated space. </s>
<s> It's a seagate 1TB backup drive. </s>
<s> There was nearly 500 GB of data on it. </s>
<s> Do I need to use some data recovery program or is there another way. </s>
<s> I don't think an entire hard drive can be formatted in 2 seconds. </s>
<s> Can someone please help. </s>
<s> I can't stress enough how important the data on the drive is to me. </s>
<s> Regards Stished </s>
<s> Let me start repeating the start of my previous post (for another member): &quot;Your story proves 2 well-known things: 1. </s>
<s> External hard disks aren't suitable for data storage (just for transport and backup) 2. </s>
<s> If you have only one copy of data (no backup) you risk to lose it (that's a calculated risk, if the time to make a backup is more than the time to make the documents again).&quot; With that being said, all I can say more is that the top post in this forum mentions a lot of free and paid recovery programs. </s>
<s> Some might work. </s>
<s> You only know when you try. </s>
<s> It's recommended to make a clone of the disk (on another 1 Tb disk) and let the recovery programs work on that clone. </s>
<s> That way, the first one you try won't do things that would interfere with the workings of the second one. </s>
<s> But if the data on the drive are really important, I wouldn't use the DIY programs but find a professional data recovery company to do it. </s>

<s> Thanks Kees... Will keep a backup of the backup in future... </s>
<s> However, do you think I really need to use a data recovery software? </s>
<s> Is there something else that can be done?Surely, 1 TB can't be formatted in 2 seconds. </s>
<s> Maybe there is another solution. </s>
<s> Regards Stished </s>
<s> That's the DIY software in that top post. </s>
<s> If formatting starts with the FAT or the directory, you can clear a lot in 2 seconds. </s>
<s> And although the data is still on the disk, it's kind of a puzzle to find it. </s>
<s> That's what that recovery software does. </s>
