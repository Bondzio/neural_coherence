got one of each.
lyinksys wrt54g / netgear wpn924 used lynksys for years.
only problem being distance rage on the wireless side.
new toshiba notebook with built in 54g could not get connected 50 feet away.
netgear works fine but as a starcraft nut found that netgear has bigtime time lag in resolving ip addresses.
partly a starcraft problem i suspect but linksys works fine.
now running both.
netgear(for wireless) is bridged thru lynksys to cable modem.
startcraft limited to lynksys.
regards.
