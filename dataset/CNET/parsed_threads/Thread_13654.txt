<s> I'm looking to upgrade the graphics card that came with my computer. </s>
<s> I currently have a GeForce 7300 LE and am wondering if I have to stick with Nvidia or if I can switch to ATI. </s>
<s> Do some motherboards only support some cards. </s>
<s> I have a PCI express and two PCI expansion ports. </s>
<s> The rest of my stats are: It's an HP Pavilion a1650y series Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Pentium 4 3.06GHz 2 GB DDR2-533MHz dual channel SDRAM 80GB 7200 rpm SATA Hard Drive 128MB NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE, w/ TurboCache 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN PCI Card HP 19-inch LCD Flat Panel Monitor Also I currently have a 300 watt PSU, the graphics card will need more power is there any danger in getting a PSU with too much wattage, say 650. </s>
<s> Thanks alot for any help I really appreciate it. </s>
<s> There is no danger of a too big PSU. </s>
<s> The PC components only draw what they need. </s>
<s> Any reserve makes for a poor man's power conditioner or UPS (only good for a split second of AC loss.) </s>
<s> Another analogy is a car. </s>
<s> Run your car at 50, you get so many miles before a breakdown. </s>
<s> Drive at 100, you get less miles. </s>
