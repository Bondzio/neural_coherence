1.6.1	Ray According to Compaq , the 7598 uses the Intel 810 chipset .	St
1.6.2	You will have to install a PCI video card as there is no AGP slot on a 810 chipset motherboard .	St
1.6.3	Every 810 chipset motherboard that I have upgraded lets you disable the old display adapter in the Device Manager .	St
1.6.4	Bring up the Device Manager and click on the + next to Display Adapter .	St
1.6.5	Highlight your old video adapter and click Properties .	St
1.6.6	Look near the bottom of the properties window and find a square box labeled Exists in all hardware profiles .	St
1.6.7	Un-check this box .	St
1.6.8	That will disable the old video adapter .	Sug
1.6.9	Click OK. Make sure that you have installed your new PCI video card before you do this .	St
1.6.10	And after you install your new PCI video card , be sure to move the monitor cable to the new card .	St
1.7.1	No mention of any & quot ; disable & quot ; feature , but a select on which display would be primary .	St
