Me too.
Long ago my pager wasn't working.
During lunch I went to the support line where the nice fellow took my pager, opened it and flipped the battery over.
I guess I should have been watching the show as he did that with about every third person.
&quot;Next!&quot; Yes, I hung my head after I said my thank you.
