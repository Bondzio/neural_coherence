4607	6	302293	2818510	2818515	R. Proffitt	7/24/08 12:18 PM	1.21690188E12	What?	That sounds very expensive. Why would you not just buy that latest retail version? Keep in mind that Nero doesn't work with all drives or media types. I dropped a hint earlier about the log containing more clues but let me try BLUNT! 1. What make of the media that fails? 2. What firmware version for each drive MAKE and MODEL too please?

Proffitt	7/24/08 12:31 PM	1.21690266E12	Bingo. &quot;updated&quot;	The updating of firmware is a well known way to kill off the ability to use the OEM versions of Nero. You now know why this happens. -&gt; The only fix I've found is to go back or scrub the drive clean of any sign of Nero then install their latest RETAIL version. Any OEM version may not do here. Thanks for the final clue. Bob

4607	10	302293	2818553	2818521	R. Proffitt	7/24/08 1:29 PM	1.21690614E12	Not much.	This is the bane of the OEM versions. They seem to do odd things when firmware or drive change. Glad we've found it. Since you don't have the full retail copy look to freeware DVD and other creation/burning programs.
