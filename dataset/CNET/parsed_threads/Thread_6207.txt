<s> I have Windows Vista 32bit and just upgraded the ram from 2-1GB DDR2 cards to 4-1GB DDR2 cards. </s>
<s> I know that Windows Vista 32bit will only run 3GB but I've read online that the Video Card and other hardware, will also use some memory. </s>
<s> So installing 4GB will allow you to use around 3.5GB. </s>
<s> My issue is that when I installed 4GB, the computer would light up like it is on, but the screen would stay black and the tower would beep every 5 seconds or so. </s>
<s> It never did start up either. </s>
<s> So I removed one of the cards and it works fine on 3-1GB card. </s>
<s> Is the fourth card defective, or the motherboard memory receiver wrecked or can the system not run with more than 3GB installed? </s>
<s> You have been given a hint the machine's details (and the sticks) matters and to check crucial.com Cross posting is fine but do fill in the missing details when you do. </s>
