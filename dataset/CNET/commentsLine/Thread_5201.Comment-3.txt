thank you for your response and i apologize for how long it has taken me to respond to you.
i currently use tversity, free version.
so, if i get a dlna server, then if i try to stream something that is protected by cinavia, it will still stream?
and an unrelated question.
do you know how to turn off the windows media center streaming because i don't like two icons appearing on my ps3.
i know it's petty and picky but i'm picky.
