Changing the PCB rarely works.
Here's why.
Not only must you match the make/model, but the FIRMWARE version and PCB revision levels.
Many will not find a working drive to steal the PCB from.
They'll get another dead drive and hope it works.
Companies like DriveSavers and Ontrack (dot com) offer data salvation services every day.
