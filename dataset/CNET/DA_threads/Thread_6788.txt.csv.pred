1.1.1	I cannot get my ATI All in Wonder 9800 AGP to post when combined with the Asus A8N Deluxe MB.	St
1.1.2	The ATI board works on an older Asus MB and the MB works with a PCI video board.	St
1.1.3	After much conversation with the ATI people I am concerned that the AGP slot in the MB is defective.	St
1.1.4	Has anyone gotten this combination to work?	Polite
1.1.5	The ATI people won't comment on this, and the ASUS people will not reply.	St
1.1.6	Thanks, David	St
1.2.1	The ATI ALL in WOnder 9800 AGP works on an AGP port and cannot on a PCI video board.	St
1.2.2	The Asus A8n deluxe board has PCI-Express slots and ordinary PCI slots, none of which works with the card!!!	St
1.2.3	Suggest get a new card.	St
1.2.4	The 9800 is comparable to an X600 which costs $200.	St
1.2.5	ROger	St
1.3.1	No Sir, the A8N Deluxe I have does have a AGP slot.	St
1.3.2	Note that Asus makes at least 3 boards that start with A8N.	St
1.3.3	Now, can you answer the question.	St
1.3.4	Thanks, David	St
1.4.1	David, unfortunately you have run into a problem that ATI refuses to deal with (or admit to).	St
1.4.2	There is an energy spike that occurs with this card during bootup that causes many newer mobo's to auto shut down.	St
1.4.3	I went thru the whole bit with an Abit AS8 V board and finally had to buy a different video card to fix the problem.	St
1.4.4	There is nothing wrong with your mobo.	St
1.4.5	The only fix I have heard (which isn't really a very good one) is to disconnect the secondary power cable to the video card for about 2 seconds at the start of booting up and then plug it in.	St
1.4.6	What a pain every time you start your system!!	St
1.4.7	Until ATI deals with the problem your 9800 AIW is going to be useless.	St
1.4.8	My best advice is to get a new TV tuner (an HD one) and avoid ATI.	St
1.4.9	It sucks that I paid almost $400 for my AIW when it was newly released and like you I rebuilt my new system around the darned thing (instead of a newer PCI-e system and core 2 duo cpus which my AS8 V can't support).	St
