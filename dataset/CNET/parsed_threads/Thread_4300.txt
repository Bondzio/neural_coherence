<s> Hi, I have a wierd problem with my HP Desktop. </s>
<s> It's a Pavilion a1747c, running an AMD 64 dual processor with 3 Gigs of ram. </s>
<s> I am running Windows Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> Lately on boot, I receive a notice that the system fan has failed and to press F2 to ignore. </s>
<s> The system then boots normally. </s>
<s> I keep all vents clean and blow dust out of the Mother board at least every Month or so. </s>
<s> Both internal fans are running normally and they are quiet. </s>
<s> Is there a way to clear the message? </s>
<s> I have never had a shutdown because of heat. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> While the fan maybe working the sensor on it maybe losing contact or has gone bad. </s>
<s> If you find more than 2-wires going to the fan, that maybe the fault lies. </s>
<s> I suggest you at least reseat the fan connection several times, clean it and see if it changes or goes away. </s>
<s> Otherwise, if the error doesn't cause a non-boot for the the PC it becomes more of an nuisance, provide the fan actually works. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If reseating the fan plug does not help. </s>
<s> What you may have is a fan that is a little worn and slow to start. </s>
<s> The result is when the bios does it's scan the rpm's are too low......error. </s>
<s> When you open the case and look at the fan it is now up to speed.....looks good. </s>
<s> The fix......replace the fan. </s>
