1.1.1	My iBook started making a strange , new noise about a week ago .	St
1.1.2	It has started making the noise more and more frequently .	St
1.1.3	I have not a clue what it may be and any hint will be appreciated .	St
1.1.4	The machine is a 1.2 ghz G4 iBook - 12 inch screen - approx .	St
1.1.5	3 years old - model M9623LL/A The sound is like an electrical motor starting up .	St
1.1.6	Very low in volume to begin and gets louder ( but never too loud ) .	St
1.1.7	If I could type out the sound , it may sound something like this ... & quot ; ma - waaaaAAAHHH & quot ; It starts out low pitched and gets higher pitched and then drifts off until the sound disappears .	St
1.1.8	The sound lasts anywhere from a second to as much as three seconds before it disappears .	St
1.1.9	The sound seems to be coming from the lower , left hand corner where an air intake is positioned .	St
1.1.10	Is there a fan or transformer located in that location ?	Ques
1.1.11	There is no disc in the cd drive and the hard drive continues to make it 's regular faint clicking sound .	St
1.1.12	I use Smart Reporter to keep track of the physical well being of my hard drive .	St
1.1.13	I use iStat Pro to keep track of other system functions .	St
1.1.14	I am using my second battery after the first one was recalled .	St
1.1.15	iStat Pro says my current battery health is only 84 % .	St
1.1.16	I would appreciate any information anyone can give me .	Polite
1.1.17	I can live with the noise but if it foreshadows future problems , I would like to catch it early .	St
1.1.18	thanks in advance ... grim	Polite
1.2.1	the lower left hand corner of the G4 iBook is exactly where the HD is located .	St
1.2.2	As to what the sound may be , it sure sounds like a fan getting itself settled but the only fan on that machine is located at the rear of the machine , just to the left of the words iBook G4 .	St
1.2.3	Curious P	St
1.3.1	My MBP has two fans , and both are opposite each other ; one by the power button , and one on the left side .	St
1.3.2	Of course that 's what it always appeared to be .	St
1.3.3	If your iBook had been built the same way , I 'd say the fan was doing it , but mrmacfixit said the fan is positioned more at the rear by the iBook logo .	St
1.3.4	If the HD is doing it , you can try to run some scans and test for bad blocks .	St
1.3.5	It could be rotating abnormally because of this .	St
1.3.6	My fans will start up and go crazy if I 'm constantly using all of my processor 's power and all of my RAM , but not for just one to three seconds .	Sug
1.3.7	Sounds like your HD could be having issues , or your fan .	St
1.3.8	If want , you could take it into the Apple Store for a diagnostic if you ca n't find the problem .	St
1.3.9	Even better if you had any AppleCare left , but you probably do n't .	St
1.3.10	Hope this helps .	St
