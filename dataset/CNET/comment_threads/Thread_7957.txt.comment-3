The only firewall I am using is the one with XP pro.
The high speed modem connects to my P4 via USB.
The P4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the P2.
I used XP pro to set up the home network.
I can access messenger on the P4, no problem, but when I sign in on the P2 it just sits there.
I have tried to connect on the P2 after turning off the XP firewall (on the P4) but that doesn't work either.
The hub doesn't have a firewall.
Yahoo messenger works fine on the P2 & P4.
