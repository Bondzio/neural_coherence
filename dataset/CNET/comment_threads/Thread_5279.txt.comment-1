I don't know what the proper terminology is, but the router is &quot;sending&quot; multiple MAC addresses to my ISP.
Let me explain: I can log only one MAC address at time.
So I changed my MAC address of the router to match that of the computer so that the ISP connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine.
However, after I use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple MAC addresses.'
I can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an IP.
(the ISP already has DCHP) Help!!
This is weird....
