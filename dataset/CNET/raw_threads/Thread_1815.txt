Check your power switch connector to the motherboard. Make sure you are on the correct pins. Check for any errant motherboard mounting studs that may be shorting out the board.

Also, make sure you did connect the frt. panel power sw. to the right connection, sometimes the remote power and frt. panel connewctions are swapped. You know you got the right one, if you short that connection with a metal tip(screwdriver). Verify 115/230V sw. is proper on power supply. Also, tell us what you have, pc cases do differe and what you had to begin with, OEM or generic? -----Willy

I got pc to turn on to find a bad video card. Fortuntely had another old card from many upgrades and pc now runs. Just need to copy registry to reformat harddrives. Thanks for advice.
