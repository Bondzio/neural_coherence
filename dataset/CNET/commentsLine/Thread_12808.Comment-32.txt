building your own is both economical and pleasureable.
you get the components you want with the brand named parts recomended and there is no need to upgrade from &quot;on board video, sound and ram.
there is also the tendancy by brand name computers to include &quot;trial&quot; software that is only the partial program and it runs out in 30 days or so.
then you are faced with the prospect of having to buy the &quot;full&quot; program at considerable cost to you.
there are also &quot;bundled software&quot; to deal with, some of whitch do not play well together.want your own virus protection and spyware tools?
if you buy a system from dell, you get there take on this and it can be hard to get rid of it.
i use tiger direct for the quality products i want, at the price i want and have yet to be disapointed in both the products and the advice i got from the helpfull staff.
it is easier than you might think to &quot;build&quot; you own!
i am currently on the third generation amd system i have built and going strong!
