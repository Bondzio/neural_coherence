i have been getting mine from printpal.com for the last few years.
service has been great, and fast.
never had to return any, so i cannot comment about that.
for a 10% discount and free shipping,use  10. before i found these guys, i bought from mrink.com.
i had a couple of leaky carts and a wierd message on the monitor due to incompatibility problems.
mrink made good with minimum hassel.
urgent needs i usually get at walmart.
thinking of trying the refill trick at walgreens next time o have an empty.
iheard bad news about some of the e bay vendors, so i didn`t even try them.
ymmv, and good luck.
