<s> This is to let everybody know what we have learned about the XPS 700 in the Dell forums. </s>
<s> By the way, &quot;we&quot; refers to XPS 700 purchasers. </s>
<s> 1) The nVidia 590 chipset that Dell openly brags about on their mobo's is really a limited version of the 590 southbridge combined with a &quot;slimmed down version of the nForce 4 northbridge&quot;. </s>
<s> Several features of the 590 chipset (as listed on the Nvidia site) are disabled on the Dell mobo. </s>
<s> 2) The X-Fi sound card that Dell claims to put in this computer is a licensed version which, once again, has been limited. </s>
<s> It does not support Dolby 5.1 nor does it support DTS. </s>
<s> 3) The special &quot;XPS support team&quot;, who is supposed to be available 24/7 (part of the cost of the XPS) told a customer who's power button broke after 2 weeks of ownership, that she would have to wait until Monday for a resolution. </s>
<s> Also included in the price of an XPS, next day in-home service. </s>
<s> So beware possible Dell customers. </s>
<s> This is apparently not the same Dell we once knew. </s>
<s> They have flat out lied to their customers at all stages of production. </s>
<s> Perhaps they will change their way of doing business soon; but until then...BEWARE </s>
<s> This is why I don't purchase performance critical or home systems from the big boys anymore. </s>
<s> When I build my own, I have know exactly what is going into my machine--no surprises. </s>
<s> I also don't have to pay for hardware/software I don't want or won't use. </s>
<s> I still rely on the big boys for office/corporate systems. </s>
