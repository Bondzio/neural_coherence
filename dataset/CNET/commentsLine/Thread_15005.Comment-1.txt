i saw this question posted in 2004, so i thought i would ask it again.
i've been unemployed for too long and the current economny is crap.
i have heard form an instructor at a local community college that the a+ cert.
is going to dissapear soon.
the main question is, is the a+ cert still worth going after to get a job?
i've been playing with my own computer for years adding this or that hw thing.
