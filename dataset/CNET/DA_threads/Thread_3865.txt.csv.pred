1.1.1	I recently (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) purchased a Lexmark X4975 All-in-one wireless printer and installed it without too much difficulty.	St
1.1.2	However, since I set it up, something occurred that has caused it not to work, either wirelessly or via USB.	St
1.1.3	When hooked up via USB, I get the usual recognition of the printer, everything looks fine, it shows up in the printer list, but when I try to print, it claims that it isn't communicating.	St
1.1.4	When trying to print wirelessly, the printer progress window pops up, shows 5 or 10% progress then it stalls.	St
1.1.5	I have a feeling that it may be the installation of Service Pack 3.	St
1.1.6	(I have a Compaq V6000 laptop running XP Pro).	St
1.1.7	In my household, there are two other laptops that can print wirelessly just fine.	St
1.1.8	They both have XP Home ( I am unsure whether they have SP3 yet) Lexmark Tech support is stumped at the moment.	St
1.1.9	I can't recall exactly when I upgraded to SP3.	St
1.1.10	Is there a log by which I can find out when that was installed on my computer?	St
1.1.11	Beyond that, does anybody have any other theories?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	What FW Software are you running?	St
1.2.2	The theory of it being SP 3 is not an option as works with other people and Lexmark Printers.	St
1.2.3	Have you been giving a SR number?	St
1.2.4	If so please post it.	Sug
1.3.1	I am running the standard Windows firewall.	St
1.3.2	I will need you to explain what an SR number is and how it applies to this issue.	St
1.3.3	And just so I am clear, SP3 does NOT work with Lexmark Printers?	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	No SP 3 DOES work with Lexmark Printers, I was stating that that would not be the cause of your issue.	St
1.4.2	An SR number is something that the Agent would give you at the end of your call so if you call back it can be looked at.	St
1.4.3	I was wondering what troubleshooting they have done.	St
1.4.4	The printer you have is one of Lexmarks newest printers.	St
1.4.5	Have you tried updating the firmware which is located below.	St
1.4.6	ftp://ftp.lexmark.com/driver/inkjet_drivers/4900/firmware/4900SeriesFirmwareUpdate.exe	St
1.5.1	I just got a call back from Lexmark and they ran me through the fix.	St
1.5.2	Apparently, the lxdr_device service was disabled so I just had to go into services.msc to enable it to start automatically.	St
1.5.3	All told, a very simple fix, but it took a lot of wrangling to get it fixed.	St
1.5.4	Ah, well.	St
1.5.5	Life is good again now that I can print again!	St
1.5.6	From my other searching on the net regarding SP3 and lexmark printers, this is a common problem with SP3 disabling this service.	St
1.5.7	Thanks for your help and input.	Polite
