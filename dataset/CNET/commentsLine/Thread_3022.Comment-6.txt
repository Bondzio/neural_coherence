for me, my step by step is... 1. power off.
2. cover off.
3. install card per manual.
4. power up.
connect monitor to connection that works.
5. set bios to pci if i added a pci card, or agp if i installed an agp card.
save and reboot.
6. move monitor connection if need be.
7. let windows boot.
8. just ok all the errors.
9. install the drivers.
best of luck.
if that doesn't do it, then it's likely you are like many other owners and need to try a nvidia card.
