for me, i have the same situation, you can check my other thread.
my budget is probably lower than yours ($750), i've done some research on video cards and i found that one 7950gt is much better than two 7600gt's.
it'll cost you the same amount of money to get one of those if you consider all the components you won't need like a better power supply.
sli setup (two 7600's): 1. the two 7600's (250ish) 2. power supply (20 more than a normal one for sli support) around $280 one 7950gt ko superclocked: 1. video card (280) around $250 basically, i'd go for the second option b/c you'd get more bang for your buck.
here's a link to the 7950gt ko superclocked:
