<s> I have bought Office 2007 and downloaded it to my desk top, i have the back up disks and i want to put it onto my note book instead of having to buy another office suite. </s>
<s> any ideas on how to do this since the note book doesnt have a dvd drawer? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Over the years I added an USB DVDRW drive to my collection. </s>
<s> That's how I solved this. </s>

<s> ...on more than one computer (Student/Home edition allows installation on up to three machines), then download Office from Microsoft directly onto netbook and use license number from your purchased disks to register it. </s>
<s> That's how I got it onto my netbook. </s>
<s> I found that I was able to download my wife's Office installation CD onto a 4gig jump drive from her desktop. </s>
<s> I simply plugged the jump drive into her netbook and opened up the Office installation software. </s>
<s> Of course, she has a legal version of Office with the permission to use it on more than one of her computers. </s>
<s> It all worked out just fine. </s>
