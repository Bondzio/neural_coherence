For christmas(even though it is a little late), I want to get a Terabyte hard drive.
It would be set up to be an external hard drive but I could purchase the 3.5 HDD and put it in a 1 TB enclosure.
My past experience with external hard drives (or individual HDDs) is that although a hard drive may be cheap and high capacity, it could corrupt on you as easy as pie.
While high end ones, lower capacity, but still can crap out on you as well but less likely to.
1 terabyte hard drive is an extreme high capacity hard drive so I want to be sure not to fall for them cheap and high capacity HDDs, but I lose all my data because it craps out on me.
My question is: What is a good HDD brand (specifically for a Terabyte) that also won't break the bank but also will not crap out on me as well?
Thanks in advanced!
