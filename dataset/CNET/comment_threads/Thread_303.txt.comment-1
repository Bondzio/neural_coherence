I am working on a friend pc gifted to him therefore limited with info.
PC cant boot getting 3 long beep code continuously.
these are the only info I got: motherboard: MS-6330 Ver 2.1 CPU: AMD Athlon BIOS: unknown Can anyone advise where I should start my troubleshooting.
If it is the keyboard card how can I change it since it is onbard Thanks for all your input Dre
