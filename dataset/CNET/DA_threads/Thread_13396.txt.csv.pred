1.1.1	So , while removing the hard drive on my brother 's Asus EEE 1005hab .	St
1.1.2	I , on accident , lost the little black clips that holds it in place .	St
1.1.3	Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.4	My first instinct is vinyl electrical tape , but I 'm worried what will happen if it melts , or by some odd turn , an arc or something .	St
1.1.5	The connector is the one that holds they touchpad in place , so it 's quite small .	St
1.1.6	Any tips ?	Ques
1.2.1	Many of those parts end up there .	St
1.2.2	Cheaper than the entire board .	St
1.3.1	I tend to use & quot ; shipping tape & quot ; the one with the string in it .	St
1.3.2	besides being strong , you can cut it along its length and use the strip to wrap , place or tape down & quot ; something & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	It 's certainly is n't electrically conductive and sticky and strong and seems to work .	St
1.3.4	Of course , you handle it the best you can and do n't buy cheap tape , either .	St
1.3.5	On some quick fix repairs , I have used & quot ; clear labels & quot ; used for mailing or folder labels , clear seem to be easy to work with and strong enough until a permanent fix is done or left alone .	St
