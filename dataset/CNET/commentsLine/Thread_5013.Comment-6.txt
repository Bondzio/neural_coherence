how much ram does the pc have?
i'd not think of putting windows 7 on with less than 2 gb as bare minimum.
also, make sure nothing is plugged into any usb ports during the installation or anything like odd card readers are attached.
now when looking at the cpu specs on that one, i'd not expect windows 7 to turn it from a spark to a lightening bolt.
vista and win7 aren't that much different in performance when setup on the same hardware.
