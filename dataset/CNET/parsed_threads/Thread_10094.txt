<s> im looking for advice on the nas220 by seagate before purchasing. </s>
<s> I am looking to know how this device handles streaming movies and music to xbox units and if it can do this without any issues when acting as a media server ? </s>
<s> any advice and support is welcome especially if any members have this nas drjve and use it in the same manor as i intend to. </s>
<s> Sorry, it failed. </s>
<s> All NAS devices have issues. </s>
<s> If not the device itself then the owner's network and the players of the content. </s>
<s> There is no known issue free solution today. </s>
<s> I wish you had not made this question such an easy one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok. is there any media servers that are up to the job ? </s>
<s> shame about the nas drives </s>
<s> Again, none. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Because I am seeing folk get content from, let's say, the internet and the encoding is all over the map these media servers only support a small percentage of possible encoding so there will be issues. </s>
<s> Can you share why you made this such an easy question? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so in short we are being mislead with false advertising such as these devices being able to perform when infact they dont ! </s>
<s> all i am looking for is a sound device that allows me to share media files to other connected devices on my network, seems like i am fighting a loosing battle . </s>
<s> The questions are so easy if you already know the answers ? </s>
<s> if you never ask then how do we learn ? </s>
<s> a fundemental learning curve ! </s>
<s> can you offer any solutions to my issue ? </s>
<s> would like to have this capacity on my network but now realise nas drives are not the answer. </s>
<s> I am currently using a netgear DGND3700 router but the ready share feature i am not to convinced with either ie; supporting a 2 TB external Hard drive ? </s>
<s> Sorry that I made it sound easy. </s>
<s> You asked GREAT QUESTIONS and were SPOT ON when you declared that the marketing made it sound like it all works. </s>
<s> The DGND3700 is not a bad choice but as we (not you, but somewhere on this forum) discovered isn't perfect. </s>
<s> One CNET member was having issues with the NAS feature and their Xbox 360. </s>
<s> We did some searching and discovered we had to FIDDLE with a setting. </s>
<s> This means that even this failed the &quot;without issue&quot; test. </s>
<s> As to the 2TB drive size, Netgear should answer that. </s>
<s> My take is that most folk are put off by the mess of encoding and the rather sluggish file transfers. </s>
<s> That is, they are used to much faster transfers. </s>
<s> For example if you can wait half a hour for that video to copy up to the NAS then you'll be OK on that aspect. </s>
<s> Then we have the encoding of the content to cover. </s>
<s> The player, if a PC is pretty capable but today I find folk trying to play it on some HDTV and then the truth is revealed. </s>
<s> Or the owner learns about video encoding, transcoding and lip sync. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For the HDTV player it's a Logitech Revue. </s>
<s> For the NAS, it's some netbook (low power, capable and cheap.) </s>
<s> For the other content I usually plug it right into the Revue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> happy days, thats what im looking for </s>
<s> Even though what I use now has a long history of things that didn't work out (the old ROKU HD, some HTPC, too many &quot;media players&quot;) I am looking to change this working system some day. </s>
<s> I'm considering the Sony Google TV since it has a BD player. </s>
<s> Just want to test it. </s>
<s> WHY? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The BD player. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It's 1080p versus the Revue's 720p. </s>
<s> The Revue is working well but I wonder if it can be better. </s>
<s> The Boxee seems to get good reviews but I haven't tried it yet. </s>
<s> And strange I haven't seen one in the stores here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well i took the plunge,,,,,,,,,,,,was about to purchase a 5tb Nas drive but opted for a cheaper trial device.............got the seagate goflex 2tb product and have to say thus far NO problems whatsoever....... all my music/movie files are available through any DLNA device that i have connected to my network, happy as can be........................just hope this lasts....... </s>
