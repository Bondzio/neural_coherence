I agree with these guys.
Go to www.crucial.com to fin out what memeory is needed for your motherboard.
They have some of the best quality memory available today.
I do NOT recommend &quot;generic&quot; memory, as thy are usually POORLY built and you will waste money.
Go with Crucial/Micron to be SURE.
They GUARANTEE that the memory they suggest will work for your motherboard, and if it fails at ANYTIME, they'll replace it for FREE.
