1.1.1	do you think that the antek 1200 cpu case is the most suitaqble one for my msi eclpse motherboard loaded with 3 video card, 5 hard disk, 2 blu ray, psu included.	St
1.1.2	any good suggestion.	Polite
1.1.3	or better cpu case, much larger than antek 1200 is more likely appreciated.	St
1.2.1	it should be big enough to hold everything.	St
1.2.2	I think the only issue might be some longer cable may be need (you will get that solution when you get to that point).	St
1.2.3	I like Antec stuffs..Good building.	St
1.3.1	not a CPU case, easier to assist if the terminology is correct.	St
1.3.2	Picking out a computer case for a new build (or as an addition) is strictly a personal choice; however, with new technology comes more problems in regards to heat management, and making sure there is ample room for the newer video cards, etc.	St
1.3.3	The Antec 1200 is a nice case (20.2 x 8.4 x 22.9 inches); the Corsair Obsidian 800D is only $40 more than the 1200 (24.0 x 9.0 x 24.0 inches), offering more room, better airflow, better cable management http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139001	St
