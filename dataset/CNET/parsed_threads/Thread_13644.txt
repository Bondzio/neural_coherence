<s> Deciding on whether to make a last stand with a new agp graphics card or upgrade the whole computer. </s>
<s> Here's my computer: http://valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php?id=598059 Reason on upgrade is I'm experiencing low fps lately on my games. </s>
<s> Down to 10fps sometimes. </s>
<s> Heres some cards I've been looking at: ASUS AH3650 SILENT/HTDI - VisionTek Radeon HD2400 VisionTek Radeon X1950 Pro Xtreme Gamer Edition HIS Radeon HD 2600 XT Fan - graphics adapter - Radeon HD Welcome any/all suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> card and what's the cost ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I'd take a look at Nvidia GPUs. </s>
<s> Also I have a single core system with an ATI 9700 so be sure to not expect 20 fps improvements. </s>
<s> All the cards are between $60-110. </s>
<s> Don't know what improvement to expect. </s>
<s> Only assumptions I can make are that with my card being 128 and going to 512, it should be moderate.? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> That's what Im trying to avoid, bottle necking from a better card to a single core system. </s>
<s> If that's what will happen, then I guess I need to start from scratch. </s>
<s> Also I've included the Nvidia gpu's in my searches, but they always get knocked out. </s>
<s> And I'm not crazy about Ati's software either. </s>
<s> Is the CPU would spike to 100% in games where the Nvidia 9400 (sorry but that's the highest model I have) would on the same game not spike the CPU but would loaf around 30 percent. </s>
<s> Any ATI I tried would have the CPU and GPU at 100% which had the fans running full tilt. </s>
<s> It will help you get a better perspective on value and performance. </s>
<s> Just keep in mind every $$ you spend on an AGP GPU could be going toward a new system with room to grow, a warranty, etc., http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Components,1/Graphics-Cards,4/ VAPCMD PS...re the 128MBs vs 512MBs RAM ... that's part of it but I'm under the impression lots of RAM with a whimpy GPU chip just doesn't make it fast or materially faster. </s>
<s> I take from that performance has as much or more to do with the GPU chip itself. </s>
