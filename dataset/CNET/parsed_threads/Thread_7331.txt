<s> I recently bought a USB3 portable Hdd. </s>
<s> case. </s>
<s> From my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my eSATA Hdd...it might even be slightly faster. </s>
<s> I transferred 3.8Gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my eSATA takes about 4 minutes. </s>
<s> Oh the USB3 case is connected to the USB2 port of the computer only. </s>
<s> I didn't have a USB3 port to connect it to (another story for later). </s>
<s> I transferred a 2.44 gig file from my main box to both a USB 2 and an eSATA external. </s>
<s> The eSATA transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the USB 2 was about a minute and a half. </s>
<s> Your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one I used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the eSATA and 2 1/2 minutes to the USB2. </s>
<s> then I have. </s>
<s> I was really looking to see if just the usb3 case alone would make a difference as I have experienced. </s>
<s> My usb2 transfer rate usually ran about 2 minute per GB. </s>
<s> It's a turtle compare to what you have. </s>
<s> and not the USB. </s>
<s> Your USB connection seems to be more consistent with my USB 2. </s>
<s> In a sense, that might answer your own question. </s>
<s> You are operating at USB 2 functionality but your eSATA is messed up. </s>
<s> It should be much faster. </s>
<s> I wonder if you don't suffer from that Intel matrix storage manager issue. </s>
