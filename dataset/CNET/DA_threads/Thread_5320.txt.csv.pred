1.4.1	Hi all Jim here .	St
1.4.2	Just spent a month trying to resolve problems with my netgear router ( 624 model ) .	St
1.4.3	This is the second netgear router gone bad in less than a year .	St
1.4.4	I have spent about $ 75.00 in service calls ( 1 for each router ) and a month of emailing to have netgear tell me the router is bad .	St
1.4.5	Their warranty replacement solution is to mail back the defective router and then they will send a replacement ... a 2 week time frame and I have to pay shipping ; or I can pay about $ 20.00 to have them ship a new router before shipping mine ... or pay above that to have next day shipping .	St
1.4.6	I told them this was unacceptable ... needless to say I will be going out this week and purchasing a link sys router .	St
1.5.1	Hook up as follows ISP router/modem & gt ; Netgear Now plug everything in and turn the isp modem on first .	St
1.5.2	Now turn on the Netgear router .	St
1.5.3	In the back on the router is a reset button .	St
1.5.4	Push it in for ten seconds and wait for it to reset .	St
1.5.5	Now plug in the ethernet cable to your computer .	St
1.5.6	Plug the other end of the ethernet cable into a numbered port of the router , 1,2,3 or 4 .	St
1.5.7	Login to the router .	St
1.5.8	http : //192.168.0.1 ( this will be your login , unless you change your LAN ip address .	St

1.6.1	I forgot to tell you .	St
1.6.2	For security reasons , the router has its own user name and password .	St
1.6.3	When prompted , enter admin for the router username and password for the router password , both in lower case letters .	St

1.12.1	try looking for the very small hole where you can stick a pen .	St
1.12.2	press and hold that for 30 seconds .	St
1.12.3	that is to bring back the default password and user which is what you have now .	St
