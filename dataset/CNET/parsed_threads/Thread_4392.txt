<s> Hi, I'm trying to install this PCI adapter on Windows XP Pro and am experiencing difficulty. </s>
<s> I have made several attempts at installing and will document them. </s>
<s> 1st Attempt: -Installed PCI card -Started Computer -Installed CD software/drivers before using add hardware wizard -Tried to use Add Hardware wizard, was unable to find the driver using the automatic and advanced options (The D-Link driver was not even listed in the list of drivers) -Downloaded driver off the internet from the D-Link support site to no effect, Add Hardware Wizard still did not work *After all this, I decided that I should try fresh and try installing the CD software first before the PCI card, so I uninstalled all the D-Link software on my computer, deleted the PCI device from Device Manager and did a system restore to before I installed the PCI adapter in the first place. </s>
<s> 2nd attempt: -Installed CD software -Shut down computer -Installed PCI adapter -Booted up and instantly used the Add Hardware Wizard -The automatic and advanced options both yielded the same results again. </s>
<s> The error was that it could not find software on the computer or the installation Cd which matched the PCI device. </s>
<s> So, I have exhausted all the options I Can think of, does anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> Please advise! </s>
<s> You need to start here http://support.dlink.com/ Locate your model and go to support. </s>
<s> I would have done it for you but there are several revisions of that device. </s>
<s> In the XP forum, I think I noted the methods written here didn't match the ones in the manual. </s>

<s> Sometimes the install CD will be separated by OS versions. </s>
<s> I have a DLink wireless card for my laptop and I had to browse to the path. </s>
<s> They had OS install folders for 98, 2000, ME, XP on the installation disk. </s>
<s> It wouldn't automatically check each folder and install the correlating drivers/software. </s>
<s> I would like to know if you resolved this issue since I am having the same problem. </s>
<s> I have tried to install the card (H/W Rev B2) in an XP SP2 machine and none of the drivers can be found (tried the original CD and 3 downloaded drivers from D-Link). </s>
<s> I thought it was related to the SP2 upgrade. </s>
<s> This card was working fine in a Win98 machine. </s>
<s> Not only much the card drivers be correct but many systems I find never had the BIOS updated or the motherboard drivers updated. </s>
<s> Some install firewalls and that closes off the networking and they flail about trying numerous fixes. </s>
<s> You post didn't tell much. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You asked if I have resolved the problem. </s>
<s> Not even close. </s>
<s> I still think it is something to do with Microsoft's operating system. </s>
<s> But just try to get someone to answer a question. </s>
<s> Show me your money first. </s>

<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> If your motherboard pci slots are not 2.2 compatible, it's not going to work. </s>
<s> in other words: if your mb is old, then your pci slots are 2.1 and the adapter will not work. </s>
<s> what mb do you have? </s>
