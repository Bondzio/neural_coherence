I have finally gotten 2 wireless networks operating using a Netgear WNR2000 setup for wireless-N /WPA2 security as the primary router connected to the DSL modem.
LAN output from the Netgear (direct-wired) into the LAN on the secondary-Linksys WRT54G router setup for wireless-B & WEP security.
The secondary-Linksys has the DHCP turned off.
(I need the 802.11b/WEP for an older Tivo box, and that's all.
I want better security for a laptop which is using the N/WPA2 network.)
My question is whether someone can break into my overall network thru the less-secure secondary router?
