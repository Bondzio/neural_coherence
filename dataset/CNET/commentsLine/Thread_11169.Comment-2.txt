with power-off, reseat the cd cable harness several times, just do it at both ends.
boot-up, does the system see it and recheck the device mgr.
again.
if it still fails, visit this website:  and use the fix for missing cd drives or similar.
understand after all this doesn't fix the problem, you probably have a bad cd drive, it just wore out, replace.
it will probably be the best fix w/o all the testing, etc.. of course use a cd cleaner to clean the drive innards as well blow out using canned air.
also, it would be nice to know what drive you do have, like in model#, os, burner s/w, etc.. tada -----willy
