I would go to newegg.com (Yes I do buy all of my computer parts there. First you need a decent case - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811119047 And a good power supply...do not skimp on this. Quality power is VERY important. Good Brand Name is Antec http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103931 Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813136158 High Performance RAM http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145575 High Performance Hard drive (X2) in RAID0 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822136014 Good Video Card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127097 DVD Writer http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827151118 And Finally, the Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103546 You can get the FX series for more $$. Also the Operating Systemfor about $150. And if you need a monitor, you can get good 17'' LCD for under $300. That brings the total to around $2700 for a sweet machine Hope this helps. You will have to look around in the phone book or word of mouth for a good tech.

I think this one as the best,just check out this model: Hewlett-Packard Pavilion Media Center Desktop with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Processor 4200+ Model: m7470n you have to add video memory and 2GB ram

I also didn't know what kind of optical drives you wanted, so I didn't include any. Finally, I'm assuming that you need Windows, but I didn't include it in that list. There are two gigabytes of RAM because 4 gigs is the limit for a 32-bit OS. You will get lots of crashes and error messages. Windows Vista will be a 64-bit OS, so if you choose to upgrade to Vista, you can upgrade the RAM at the same time. You could probably get a local computer store to build it for you. Not Best Buy or CompUSA, but a smaller store. Or just give a nerd some money, a warm meal, and a place to sleep, and let them build it for you. The two hard drives should be put in Raid 1. With a Raid 1 setup, when you save a file, it gets saved on both drives. If one drive fails, you still all your data on the other one. For $3,000 you can't get the fastest parts that money can buy (there are some processors that cost $1,000 alone), but you don't need the top-of the line CPU.

I also had two 300GB drives in RAID1; he's an artist, so data security is probably pretty important. I also used a DFI board, but a cheaper, non-SLI one. I actually own the board, along with an A64 3700+, so I have first-hand experience.

I used to be one of those, and if you need support, they may not be available!I know from my past experience of being one plus you get a service contract with your build with most reputible companies (not bestbuy or compusa places..no big chains) Also, check out the stats between AMD and Intel processors...on the X2 side, AMD whoops Intel any day, anytime, anywhere!(sorry to all you Intel buffs, but it is truth!)

Desktop W/station must support MicrosoftWindows XP professional & OfficeXP, and used for emailing, internet access,word processing and spread sheetwork. 2. Graphics W/station is for CAD work (3D)complete with Microsoft Windows XP proffessional and OfficeXP 3. Also what would be the suitable printer and scanner for this set up? URGENT!!

If this is just going to be a regular desktop, not critical, I would get this: (can't find link right now), but the machine is aroubd $350 As far as the other one, you need a workhorse that you can put in RAID. I suggest this: http://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/wishlist/PublicWishDetail.asp?WishListNumber=1777001

The earlier suggestions are all fine and dandy, but (if you're a serious graphic designer/artist) I would put a bigger chunk towards the display. 19&quot; at a minimum, but I would seriously consider a widescreen model or a dual monitor setup. Photoshop, etc gets too cluttered with a small screen (constantly shifting around the palettes so you can see your work is annoying and counter-productive) and you're going to want something better-than-average when it comes to color rendition, contrast, evenness (no drop-offs of light in the corners, fading from top-to-bottom), etc... Just my $.02 on your $3000.

For the CAD station, here's my suggestion for a upper-mid range setup. You'll need to budget about $4300 but it includes dual-core processor, 4GB RAM, CAD accelerated graphics card, 500GB disk space, 23&quot; widescreen monitor, a tabloid/B size printer, and XP Pro and Office 2003.
