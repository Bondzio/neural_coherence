i don't think i would ever put a vacuum into the computer, maybe parts like in the front where some dust might collect i wouldn't be running it over all the parts in the computer.
i don't know what air you are buying but all the time i have used air it is way powerful enough to lean anything i need out of the computer.
after the can of air has been used for a while the presure does go down.
a can of air costs like $2.00 at wal-mart.
that is what i have always used.
