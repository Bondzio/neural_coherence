<s> I am using Windows 98 and have just tried to install a new Samsung CD Rom drive SH-152. </s>
<s> I checked and re-checked the internal connections very carefully. </s>
<s> Even after using the &quot;add new hardware&quot; wizard, Windows did not find the new device to install it. </s>
<s> However, the wizard is telling me that my system does have a PCI Universal Serial Bus comnnected but that this device is not installed and there is no driver for it. </s>
<s> I have failed to find the driver. </s>
<s> My questions are: 1) Are these two problems related? </s>
<s> 2) Do I need to re-install Windows? </s>
<s> 3) Anything else I might try Any help from you boffins out there would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> a burner. </s>
<s> Wun 98 automatically installs the drivers for the CD-ROM function. </s>
<s> No need to tell it to install it. </s>
<s> Possibly you didn't watch the first boot after instsalling it where windows should have detected the new hardware and installed the drivers with no help from you. </s>
<s> Now I may be an idiot and the drive is a USB type, then forget what I said. </s>
<s> Simply telling us the model of the drive would mean we would have to search to find out if it was an internal or external drive. </s>
<s> pleas include any of that special info in the intial post. </s>
<s> Do you have something connected to the USB bus?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> If you didn't already, enter the bios area and make the change for the new CD device, by setting to &quot;auto&quot;, then exit bios by saving changes. </s>
<s> To better enter bios area, read your manual or visit your systems support website. </s>
<s> Next, recheck cabling, use either master/slave or CS jumpering and if you have dual CDs installed, install accordingly. </s>
<s> Now, reboot or boot-up with all those changes, the system should see new h/w and install or ask for whatever is needed. </s>
<s> Once done, you *may* need to install any burner s/w or special CD realed s/w to make it a better experience. </s>
<s> However, you needn't install any drivers for win98 installed CD drives, it should be OK with native(ATAPI) type drivers provided by windoze. </s>
<s> I don't why you have some USB error or attention for that, you need to provide further details, of course make &quot;any cabling&quot; at all it properly seated and ordinated. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> in one of the posts. </s>
<s> Did you go into &quot;MY Computer-Properties-Device Manager, and remove old CDrom drive before shutting down and changing to new one? </s>
<s> If not, the computer can't add new one. </s>
<s> If you are adding a second drive and not changing, disregard this post. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
