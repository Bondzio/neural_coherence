I don't have the card yet so I can't look. I was wondering, because I was planning to buy a PCI fan to place directly underneath my video card so it would line up with the fan on the video card, and blow the air from the the card, out of the case to help with cooling, so I could overclock the card. With that said.... the PCI fans (go in a PCI slot, and have a fan on the inside with a vent on the outside), do they blow air into, or out of the case? My post is a bit hard to follow, so if you don't understand where I am coming from, I can try to explain more clearly.

Well, does this mean that the PCI fan I talked about also sucks air in through the vent, and blows it into the computer? If not, installing the fan would just give my new video card a harder time cooling the GPU's.

To sum it up &quot; is it better to blow or suck&quot;? There is no hard and fast rule. However if you are trying to cool a &quot;Hot Spot&quot;, Heat sink-CPU chip-Memory,then you want to concentrate the air on the spot or heat source. For overall cooling of the interior of the &quot;box&quot; then you would want to get the fan near an entrance to get the maximun amount of cool air & blow it toward the heat sources. What you do not want is to pull in dirty air (usually the bottom of the box) and blow it onto the electronic components. Hope this helps you think it through & helps you.

Just think about it do you realy want hot air to get blown on to the heatsink and make it hotter or do you want the hot air to be pulled off so that the cooloing fan can suck the hot air back out of the system cooling the system off.
