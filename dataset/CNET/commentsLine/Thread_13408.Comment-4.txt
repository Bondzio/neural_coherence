have you checked the drivers against those supplied on the site by the manufacturer?
i had the same problem with my lexmark wireless.
i could connect directly but could not use the scan functions.
new drivers sorted the problem but it was still a pain using the printer directly as a print server.
have you got your printer connected to your router?
