<s> Vista has been shoved down our throats after the appetizers of crapware and everything else. </s>
<s> First thing I would do is complete format and clean install of XP on my system or just build my own. </s>
<s> Gateway wanted to charge an additional $49 to &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista to Windows XP on a new system. </s>
<s> The customer service rep became extremely confused when I asked him why anyone would pay for, and how XP magically became an &quot;upgrade&quot; from Vista as opposed to a down-grade. </s>
<s> It's to the point that it's just almost funny that the pc user and consumer are now considered the lower 1 percent on the intellectual scale! </s>
<s> Just unpacked a new Acer laptop. </s>
<s> The only items I removed was Norton and a Yahoo toolbar. </s>
<s> This experience makes me wonder if crapware is over hyped. </s>

<s> i just removed norton from my new acer and that was it. </s>
<s> i'm also enjoying vista a lot. </s>
<s> i was really unsure about trying it because of all the negative press, but i'm glad i did. </s>
<s> Our research has shown that the less popular brands like Acer, Emachines, etc do have less crapware than Dell, Gateway, etc. </s>
<s> We are testing Toshiba right now. </s>
<s> The downfall we have found is that software that we need like Microsoft Office is not being put on systems (aside from trial versions). </s>
<s> We need the production software but assume this is one way for the distributors to keep the cost down. </s>
<s> The problems with vista we have found are that some software and hardware do not have the correct drivers as of yet. </s>
