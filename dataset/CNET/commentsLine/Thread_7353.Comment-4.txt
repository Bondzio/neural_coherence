i recognised the paper feed problem from a previous 900 series hp printer.
on that occasion, hp had told me that the rubber in the paper feed wheels was the problem, and they'd sent a free kit consisting of a cd and a device which is inserted into the printer and roughens up the rubber wheels.
so, for the 3210, i mamaged to get the indian call service to abandon their script and to send me a 'paper feed cleaning kit' specified for hp 3200 amongst others.
i've used the kit twice now, and at last the 3210 feeds reliably.
