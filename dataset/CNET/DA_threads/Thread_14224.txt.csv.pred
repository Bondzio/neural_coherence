1.4.1	I have ever heard somewhat &quot;Qiguan diagnostic cards&quot;.	St
1.4.2	It is said that their diagnstic cards thoroughly eliminated the &quot;initial codes&quot; and solved problems like wrong codes, redundant codes and omitting codes, which greatly reduced guesswork in PC troubleshooting.	St
