i may have made a rash move but i managed to get a new amd 64 fx 57 2.8ghz...after watching second hand ones swap places on ebay, over a two week period, for the same price (150).
a better gpu is next but i was dismayed at the obsolescence of a 939 socket board so thought i had better move quickly.
i will take any b0llocking like a man!
anyway i wanted to know...when the chip arrives...postal strike permitting...is it just a question of powering down the pc with the old chip in, dismantling, re-assembling and then powering up the new chip?
