i found myself staring at a black (not blue) screen that announced &quot;irreversible disk failure&quot; (or words to that effect), then the screen disappeared and i couldn't restart the computer.
i have a dell computer with xp on disk c, which was utterly, entirely, and completely gone with the wind.
fortunately, with some sort of prescience, when i had the computer put together by dell, i ordered two physical hard drives.
thus, all my data is on drive d, so although dell had to replace one drive, all my photos, manuscripts (i'm a writer) and other irreplaceable data were untouched.
but now i don't trust any hard drive, and have multiple backups--an external hard drive, and carbonite online.
now, whatever problems i have, i will only have to contend with inconvenience, not real loss.
i strongly advise everyone to back up, everything, every time.
