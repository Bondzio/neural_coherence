Unfortunately, that model is no longer made, so I was looking at other brands. I was considering an Epson Artisan 800 or a Brother Multifunction. Any thoughts? My HP printer is totally wireless and is not hooked into my router and I have multiple PCs and laptops printing to it. My concern is that the Brother and the Epson must be hooked in to the Router (which is in another room) to make it wireless, unlike the HP. Can anyone advise me if the other brands are truly wireless, or do they have to hook in through the Router. Thanks so much!

You might want to look into that instead. Pick a good printer and add the adapter. They'll generally plug into Ethernet or USB ports.
