i can't make a warrently as i built the pc.
why would i need to change the ssid and wap security.
there is nothing wrong with the connections to the 2 other computers and 2 other laptops , and i have a good firewall and no one is trying to get into the wireless router.
the only problem i have is the connection on my main pc (this one im using at the moment)
