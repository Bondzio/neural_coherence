<s> Hey.....ok i got a pretty newish computer (bout a month/two months old) its a iMedia M221 (Packard Bell) and all of a sudden has decided not to recognize my monitor!!! </s>
<s> tried plugging an old monitor into it and wouldnt work either. </s>
<s> I have been told that my video card may be out of place or not plugged in, but after looking into the computer nothing seems to be wrong. </s>
<s> Could this be a driver problem? </s>
<s> A virus problem?? </s>
<s> Please help i need the computer for work and son needs it for school (typing this from a damn library computer....) Cheers in advance </s>
<s> You head to your local repair shop. </s>
<s> I see many hours has passed since your post, Sorry. </s>

<s> A couple of possibilites. </s>
<s> Perhaps your motherboard also has a built in video card. </s>
<s> Look and see if there is another 15 pin monitor plug up near where you mouse and key board plug in. </s>
<s> If so you can go into system, hardware devices, and disable the built-in card. </s>
<s> Of course you will have to plug the monitor into that plug to be able to see to do this. </s>
<s> You could also try rebooting and starting in the safe mode, F8 and see if it works then. </s>
<s> Of course there is also the possibility the video card is bad. </s>
<s> Tired I guess 85 hours plus last week. </s>
<s> Reboot sytem hit whatever key yours uses to access the system bios, F2, CTRL F2, etc... they are all somewhat different, then is the bios disable your built in video. </s>
<s> Then reboot and if your card is okay it should work. </s>
<s> Since, its so new, why not use the warranty or techincal support they provide??? </s>
<s> Do that before opening case as that may void warranty. </s>
<s> However, in light of the problem, if you can swap monitors or video cards if possible. </s>
<s> Boot in safe mode, press F8 key while booting to get into &quot;safe mode&quot; and just allow it to finish, then just see if it even stays UP for at least 15min. </s>
<s> if it does, then you really don't have a h/w problem. </s>
<s> I suggest then look into reloading drivers for the video card/port, maybe your support/restore CD for that service alone. </s>
<s> If the problem presists and you have no techincal options from support by the vendor, then open case and reseat video card and/or cabling to same. </s>
<s> Do check for bent, pushed-in pins, etc. </s>
<s> on video cable. </s>
<s> I thought a virus could cause this problem, but use your updated AV pgm. </s>
<s> to check anyways and/or some malware scanner like Ad-Aware or SpyBot, etc. </s>
<s> to check the system. </s>
<s> If you use XP as your OS, try the new anti-spy s/w free from MS. good luck -----Willy </s>
