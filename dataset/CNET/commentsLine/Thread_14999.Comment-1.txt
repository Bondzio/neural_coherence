hi all, i am a student who has just started year 11, and i am taking graphic design.
i really enjoy the class, and i am looking to see if i could/should/would buy a graphics tablet.
i want to buy one, but i am wondering if they are really worth it.
i have a pretty low-ish budget (i don't really want to go over the $250 mark if i dont absolutely have to), and i have been looking at: - wacom bamboo's (the ones with touch capability, preferably medium sized - 27cmx14cm active area, programmable buttons) priced from $120 (for a small bamboo create) all the way up to $240 (for a medium bamboo create) -wacom intuos5's - $240 for a small, $350 for a medium first off, my parents dont really want me spending as much as $350 for something that i am not positive i will continually use (i myself dont know if i will get used to it/enjoy using it).
i dont have much money that i have available to spend, as i am saving for a car.
i plan on using it sometimes (not every day), for graphic design class, and just having fun drawing my own creations.
i do have graphic design class 4 out of 5 days of college, but i may only bring it if i bring my laptop; i cant install the drivers on school computers.
if i can bring my computer to college, then i will be using the tablet 4 out of 5 days, maybe more over the weekend for homework/leisure.
so here's my question(s) (finally): is it worth spending the extra money for a medium sized tablet?
should i try with a bamboo (small or medium?)
first, and see if i like it, and i do like it, go for an intuos?
or should i go straight for an intuos5?
if i do, would the small be big enough for me?
would i need to invest in a medium for it to be worth it?
is it worth getting a graphics tablet at all?
please, please, please be honest; i dont want to waste my hard earned money!
thanks so much for your opinions, hellz_angel
