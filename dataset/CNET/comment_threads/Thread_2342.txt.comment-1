I just purchased a laptop for home use only with an integrated wireless card (g standard).
What I want is real simple but achieving it is very confusing...I have a broadband internet connection via a cable modem.
I want a hard-wired connection to the Internet in my office (in the basement) but also want the freedom to surf the Internet when I'm upstairs or on my deck outside.
What components do I need?
Based on my research it appears all I need is a router, correct?
Any recommended routers with good range and a strong signal...and easy to setup for newbies like myself?
