<s> I found a grate deal on a ATI Radeon 9250 256MB AGP Video Card I want to get, but I'm not sure if I have an AGP slot for it. </s>
<s> could some one show me a pic or tell me what the slot looks like? </s>
<s> If you enter the model name at the computer maker's website, you can see all the specifications for your computer, including what kind of AGP slot you have, if any. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you could download and run a program like CPU-Z to learn the name of you motherboard model. </s>
<s> Google the model and you will learn a lot about what slots you have. </s>
<s> A picture, here you go: http://www.abcd.com.au/v/agp_slot.htm How did I find that? </s>
<s> I went to Google.com and typed in AGP SLOTS. </s>
<s> Tell us the computer manufasturer & model so we can help you find a compatible card. </s>
<s> Moterboard manufacturer and model name helps, too. </s>
<s> Like Linkit says...you need the MB mfg name, model and revision number if you want to be sure whether it will work or not. </s>
<s> CPUZ will help with that. </s>

<s> Today's AGP slots do not have a set voltage. </s>
<s> The voltage is set by the AGP card and the AGP slot obliges. </s>
<s> That area causes far too much confusion. </s>
<s> Another confuser is the bad writing about 8X voltages. </s>
<s> The tech writer's coffee priviledges should be revoked. </s>

<s> I had purchased one from crucial that I had to send back - it only had one slot in the card not two and it is pictured that way at this site: http://www.crucial.com/promo/index.asp?prog=uslp_clickscansnap Darrell Lewis - PS the piece that is in the center was the difference and crucial has no space on the side for it to fit. </s>
<s> Fortunately, I didn't force it in nor did i remove that piece in the slot. </s>
<s> But if that looks like yours you can find out when you go to the site. </s>
<s> The memory was correct but the AGP Vid was not, it has one notch and not two. </s>
