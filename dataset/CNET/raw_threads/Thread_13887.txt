After many many calls to them just to get it able to get online, I now want to be able to use it for network storage. I have a Dell Inspiron 6000 wirelessly connected to it, and a Maxtor 100GB hard drive connected to the router via USB. Following Linksys' instruction manual, I can FTP to the drive. However, I can't see it in My Network Places. Can someone please help?

It is one method for storing files in a central location and sharing them. FTP servers will not show up under &quot;My Neighborhood&quot;. That is a windows workgroup thing. Personally, I prefer the FTP method. Windows file sharing is very chatty and can negatively impact wireless networks when many machines are broadcastion Netbios traffic. SKrall

Either change the router workgroup to Workgroup or your computer workgroup to Linksys. After doing this you should be able to see your computer and your router in My Network Places. Troy
