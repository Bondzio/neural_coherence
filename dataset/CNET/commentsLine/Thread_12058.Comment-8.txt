&quot;512mb of ram is hardly enough for modern systems&quot; -um 512mb is more than adequate, and you will find 512mb in most of the computer systems sold today.
the minimum requirement for windows xp is 128mb.
in more pricey systems the 1gb is popular and 2gb is just overkill.
in fact, having alot of ram can slow the performance of your computer down and 512mb is known as the &quot;sweet-spot&quot; for many computers today.
&quot;secondly, ati x200 isn't exactly top of the line.&quot; -secondly it's not supposed to be top of the line, its a budget computer system!!
however it is certainly better than many other integrated graphics out there that you would get with a budget computer.
&quot;3rd, what kind of monitor is included in the $629.99 package?&quot; -a 15in.
lcd monitor is included in that package from bestbuy which is $629.99 after $330.00 in rebates.
-also the emachines is very popular because it is easily upgradable as john robie highlights in this post:  &quot;the t6212 caught on for gamers (and others) mainly because of the features it has for the price.
it has a fairly powerful processor, the athlon 64 3200, which has the 64-bit support for the future, amd's better socket 939 which usually doesn't come with inexpensive computers (i don't know of any), a motherboard which has a pci-express x16 video card slot allowing for upgrade of the integrated on board grahics.
the new pci-express (pcie) video cards are the future slowly replacing the more expensive agp cards.
a 160gb hard drive, 512mb of ram (memory), 17&quot; monitor and printer are also a plus for an inexpensive computer...&quot; -what are the specs of your $600 built computer?
i'm curious.
