Let's not use or speak of that again.
In this forum in the top or second post and reply number 17 shows how to use your DSL modem's router and add your new D-Link WBR-2310.
This setup is slightly advanced so until you read our top posts in this forum and specifically reply 17 I expect most to be confused by this.
