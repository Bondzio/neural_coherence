1.1.1	I have an opportunity to get a brand new in box Macbook C2D 1 gig ram 180 hard drive for my 5 mts old Macbook Pro CD 1 gig of ram, 80 hard drive.	St
1.1.2	Is it worth it?	St
1.2.1	The Pro's dedicated video should give it the boost beyond that of the non-Pro.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	even though the macbook has the new core 2 duo chip and the pro has just core duo?	St
1.4.1	Look at what benchmarks there are out there.	St
1.4.2	I wouldn't.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I think MacBook Pro CoreDuo is still better than the MacBook Coreduo2.	St
1.5.2	Specially when it comes to graphics and overall performance.	St
1.6.1	CNET.com says that the Macbook C2D and Macbook Pro C2d have similar performance.	St
1.6.2	Now the Pro has a Core Duo so the Macbook c2d should have even closer performance if not equal.	St
1.6.3	All this applies if you don't want graphical performance.	St
1.6.4	Like if you edit photos or play games and stuff then I think the Pro would be better.	St
1.6.5	Second thing is size.	St
1.6.6	Which size do u prefer.	Sug
1.6.7	If both are OK then go for what is important to you.	St
1.6.8	Simply put if you need graphical performance then go for the Pro and if you dont then go for the Macbook.	St
1.6.9	i would certainly go for the Pro.	St
