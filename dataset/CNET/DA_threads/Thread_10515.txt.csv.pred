1.1.1	when should I use the direct and cross link of UTP Cable?	St
1.1.2	Pls help.	St
1.1.3	Does it affect wired network and what is the benefit of both.	St
1.2.1	A crossover cable is needed to connect a PC to a PC or a server to a server -no hub, switch or router needed.	St
1.2.2	Old hubs/switched hubs were also connected to each other via crossover cable.	St
1.2.3	But now most modern hardware has autosensing ports that turn into crossover ports when needed.	St
1.2.4	So the crossover cable is used less frequently.	St
1.2.5	Choosing the wrong cable will not damage anything.	St
1.2.6	The connection will simply fail.	St
