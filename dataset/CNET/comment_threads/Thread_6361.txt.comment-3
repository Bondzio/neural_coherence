I have to agree with Steve on this one with regards to the ram issue, but remember, if you're not a frequent upgrader, the sd-ram that's in your system now is not only obsolete, but will be troublesome to find in another year and is incresingly expensive.
As an example, your ram probably runs at 133 mhz.
OCZ technology recently broke the 1000 mhz barrier with ram, so you can see it's getting further and further behind.
Personally I'd wait and upgrade the board chip and ram at the same time.
