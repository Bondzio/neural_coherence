hi bob, i have no goverment secrets, so the security level does not have to be very high.
it's more in case of theft, that i do not wish others to access my privat files.
(i'm a photographer, i store mainly digital pictures and video files on it, that are rather large in filesize.
that is why i do not wish to encrypt them, beacause it takes ages...) but i need to access them quickly, without any major time issue.
i wouldn't mind a 'digital key' solution, usually you get 2 keys and i'm not afraid of loss.
something you would use like a pass through key with some password, that does not encrypt the whole file but just blocks its access.
thanks, sidney
