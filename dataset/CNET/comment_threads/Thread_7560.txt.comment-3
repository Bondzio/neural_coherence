First of all, the noise you are hearing is either the fan or the hard drive, or something vibrating inside the case.
Is it a steady, consistent noise, a vibration, or a grinding, scratchy noise?
If the computer is located in a warm room or doesn't have adequate ventilation, the fan will run a lot.
Giving us a better description of the noise will help is sort that one out.
Now, some questions: What will you be using the computer for?
(mostly web browsing, word processing, games etc) What model is the Presario (the numbers)?
Pages loading slower - is it only web pages that are slower or are other programs slower too?
