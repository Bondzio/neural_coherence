hi, i have an internet connection (landline and wifi modem) at my parent's summerhouse as i need it for work.
nobody else does around here so i get constant nagging from neighbours to give them the password.
i can't say no however i'm afraid they may use up too much of my bandwith connection which could lead to alot of money being lost from my part.
constant and stable internet is a must for my work.
hence my question - how can i limit the bandwith i give to them?
can i create a second public network with limited bandwith or something like that?
thanks in advance!
