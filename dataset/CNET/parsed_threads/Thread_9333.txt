<s> If someone had an idea it will really help us to find out! </s>
<s> I've been in such an office and they learned the hard way that you use a pre-press print of your work on the common inkjet then done to the print shop for the high volume high quality prints. </s>
<s> Your post leads me to believe you haven't learned or done this yet. </s>

<s> You're right, and we are all students. </s>
<s> It's a project we're doing, but not a school project, a business project and we need a printer, we don't know which one or if it's possible to get one for what we wnat to do! </s>

<s> The best printer for this is 5 or more figures. </s>
<s> The office lessons are something I can share but it appears that folk insist on repeating the lesson. </s>
<s> If you want to try getting your own printer, why not head to the store and look at print samples? </s>

<s> We think the best we can do is to deal with a printing company. </s>
<s> They have the material, we do the marketing project and we can save up money and gain benefits. </s>
<s> I apologize for my rough english, I'm a french-canadian haha. </s>
<s> I really appreciate your help. </s>
<s> It helps me to ask the right question. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> I lived in Vancouver BC for many years and that was another office where we would do on screen pre-press work then a test print off the current ink jets of the day then off to the print shop for a print that we would check before the final run. </s>
<s> Today there are many good shops and it pays to read as much as you can about prepress work. </s>
<s> Here's a tutorial that's less than a sip from the firehose. </s>
