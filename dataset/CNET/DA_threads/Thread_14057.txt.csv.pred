1.1.1	I was looking at the customers of this Patriot RAM and noticed something which I thought odd.	St
1.1.2	A couple people said that, although the 2 x 1GB sticks ran at the 12000MHZ they are supposed to, adding another 2 x 1GB sticks of the exact same RAM slowed the entire FSB down.	St
1.1.3	Why would this be and is there anyway it could be avoided?	St
1.1.4	A tiny bit extra voltage maybe?	St
1.1.5	Below is the link and the reviews I was talking about.	St
1.1.6	Customer 1 This memory is very good.	St
1.1.7	Sometimes you have to burn the memory in so it can run properly and overclock.	St
1.1.8	This memory is specified to run at 1200mhz with 2 gigs not 4.	St
1.1.9	So before you purchase please do the research.	Sug
1.1.10	You very seldom run 4 gigs over 1100 mhz.	St
1.1.11	Customer 2 Cons: none-cant run 4Gigs at 1200Mhz http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220282	St
1.2.1	the official ddr2 spec ends at ddr2-1066.	St
1.2.2	also, no mobo officially supports ddr2-1200.	St
1.2.3	as with any overclocking, your results are dependent on the specific components.	St
1.2.4	so one x38 mobo may be able to hit ddr2-1200 with that ram while another x38 mobo may not.	St
1.2.5	likewise, one mobo may OC a CPU up to 4ghz while another may only get it to 3.8ghz.	St
1.2.6	p.s.	St
1.2.7	: ddr2-1200 will require a lot of voltage... these sticks want 2.3V.	St
1.2.8	the official ddr2 spec is only 1.8V so that's 27% over spec and some mobos simply can't provide it.	St
1.2.9	adding 4 sticks would need even more voltage.	St
1.2.10	and 2.3V will need a very good quality power supply with extremely tight voltage regulation.	St
1.3.1	Today the physics still apply that as you add more devices on a CPU &quot;bus&quot; it slows since each device adds capacitance.	St
1.3.2	This is not a design bug or issue and I see someone else pointed out the overclocking aspect.	St
1.3.3	Lesson?	St
1.3.4	Get by with just 2 sticks.	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	My EVGA nForce 780i motherboard, though, says it supports 1200mhz ram?	St
1.4.2	800mhz is the next highest.	St
1.4.3	It should be able to take 1066mhz as well, right?	St
1.4.4	Here's the for my motherboard if you need it.	St
1.4.5	http://www.evga.com/products/moreInfo.asp?pn=132-CK-NF78-A1&family=Motherboard%20Family	St
1.5.1	ddr2-1200 has no official spec, so if it doesn't work, you can't call evga and expect them to fix/rma the board.	St
1.5.2	likewise, you can't call patriot and expect a free replacement if it doesn't hit ddr2-1200 on your board.	St
1.6.1	so even though my motherboard lists 1200 as a RAM FSB speed, they still wouldn't offer support if it didn't work?	St
1.6.2	What about 1066mhz RAM?	St
1.6.3	Could that work even though it isn't listed?	St
1.7.1	Some one called in on this and the support was this.	St
1.7.2	&quot;Use the verified memory we used.&quot; And &quot;No we didn't test that memory.&quot; And lastly &quot;Sorry if that didn't work for you.&quot;	St
1.8.1	:P thank you	Polite
