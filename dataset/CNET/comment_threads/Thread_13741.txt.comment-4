thanks all for replying and there are many possibilies like monitor going bad, or card getting overheated, and even the AGP slot can be faulty but I have to go with jeniesis1 stating that extra cooling would benefit my pc because I use photoshop, illustrator and 3ds max so I think its a must to get extra cooling for VGA.
normally my PC is at 39 deg celcius and under high pressure it goes maximum to 55 or 56 deg celcius which to my knowledge isn't harmful.
however I don't have any idea about how to check the temperature of VGA.
is there any utility then plz tell me.
also my FX5200 has a fan and when card gets heat up it starts to spin so crazy that I can even hear it what I think is that a fan for VGA would be useful not for processor plus I will currently buy a normal monitor to test for some months about the condition of the card and the motherboard's AGP slot.
if anything goes wrong not much of the money would go to waste and I will buy 512Mb RAM to speed up the PC how do you like the idea?
