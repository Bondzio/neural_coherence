1.1.1	Greetings Everyone , My friend has a Compaq Pressario desktop using Windows Me .	St
1.1.2	He bought it through the phone company and it came with an internal dsl modem installed .	St
1.1.3	His kid recently bought a new Dell desktop using Win XP and they would like to share the dsl connection using a cable/dsl router .	St
1.1.4	Here 's my question : Is there a way to do this using the internal modem or will he need to buy an external modem ?	Ques
1.1.5	He 's been a customer of SBC for several years so maybe he can talk them into a free modem update .	St
