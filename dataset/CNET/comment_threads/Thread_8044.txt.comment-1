Hi all, I have an Iblitzz 108 Mbps Super G Wireless Router that was working fine before I moved.
Unfortunately, the driver disk was lost in the move, and Iblitzz the company is out of business.
If anyone out there has the installation directions or drivers for this model I'd appreciate it if you could help me out.
I only bought this router 1.5 years ago, and I really don't want to have to buy another one.
Thanks, Kareen McCollough
