i keep getting an error message while slipstreaming.
i download the sp2 file (it version) off microsoft's website and the sp2 file (for home computer) off another site, i get the same error message during file extraction for both.
extraction failed file is corrupt the process stopped here for the sp2 file (it): extracting file: mscorsvr.dll to directory: c:ddf798d2a9310af7847c5dba6ccf can you direct me to a working sp2 file or tell me how to fix this.
