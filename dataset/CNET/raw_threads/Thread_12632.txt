Lots of people also like TigerDirect.com. They say it is super cheap, but I don't like it that much because it is very poorly organized. Fry's is supposed to be really cheap as well although I've never been in one because it is so far away.

I've also found a lot of things on ebay, particularly looking for older/rarer items. The downside with any of those on-line companies is timing, expense of shipping, and the vagaries of buying things you can't actually see. For example, I had to return a motherboard I bought on-line. That required a phone call, wait for RMA email, then I had to pack it up and ship at my expense, and a unnecessarily long wait for the credit to be run thru to my card. In contrast I've also had a CPU that was dead on arrival. But since I got it at a local store, I took it back, they did some testing right there to confirm it was defective, and I walked out with an immediate replacement. To be honest, I paid $30 more for that CPU than I would have at the cheapest online or ebay. But I was able to finish the build the same weekend I started it. On-line shopping, if anything is backordered, returned, or anything like that, you're waiting for at least another weekend to actually get your work done. As far as having great stuff, it's all the same stuff. A Phenom is a Phenom, etc. regardless which store sold it. I'll be honest, there's a good handful of newegg receipts in my email, and I've liked them. But you have to understand stores like them have zero service or support. Until you need it, &quot;service&quot; is rather nebulous. But it has a real value, as does your time.

I've dealt with them. What I do like about NewEgg is their pictures of the products. They are by far the best at giving you an idea of what you're getting...inside and outside of the box. Provantage does have a lot of the better brands....particularly with networking goods. I live in they state they are addressed in so they do charge me tax. Their shipping is cheaper than NewEgg and often the pricing too so the total costs are close. I've had excellent service from both NewEgg and Provantage.
