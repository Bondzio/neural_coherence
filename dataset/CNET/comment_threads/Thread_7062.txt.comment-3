My motherboard does indeed have onboard video.
I tried unplugging my graphics card and using the onboard video and still no video.
I removed one module of my RAM, since I've got a V8 cooling fan for my processor stuffed inside my case; and it blocks one of the modules of memory from being removed, meaning that one is quite snug inside it's slot.
No video using just that module.
