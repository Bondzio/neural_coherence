1.1.1	Sadly I've been running this piece of junk for far too long it's been about 6 years since I built a computer and I'm having some confusion with power supplies now days this is what I'm thinking about building MB: ASUS Maximus Extreme CPU: Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 Ram: Team Xtreem 2GB 240-Pin DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600) HDD: WD Raptor X WD1500AHFD 150GB 10k RPM SATA150 Video: ASUS EAH3850 Radeon HD3850 x2 I don't know what I'm looking for in a PSU (such as do I need 2 power connectors for both cards, etc) any help is much appreciated	Ques
1.2.1	two radeon hd 3850s will cost at least $280 but won't match the performance of one geforce 8800gts/512 for $270 (before $30 rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130325	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the tip another question I don't know much about video cards in general I figure I would be able to buy one of those for now later on would I be able to add another one in?	St
1.3.2	or does it have to be Cross-fire or SLI/Cross fire isn't dependant on motherboard?	St
1.4.1	the ASUS Maximus Extreme uses the intel x38 chipset and only supports crossfire with ati/amd cards.	St
1.4.2	nvidia sli requires a mobo based on an nvidia chipset.	St
1.4.3	there are hacked nvidia drivers that will enable sli on non-nvidia chipsets, but i don't recommend that route.	St
1.4.4	if you $280 won't fit in your budget, then get a geforce 9600gt (about $150).	St
1.4.5	they're faster than an hd 3850 or hd 3870. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814141073	St
