<s> I have jsut purchased the DLink524 wireless router and am trying to set up a network. </s>
<s> I have a Dell PC for my desktop to which I have internet on (56k aol...but i cannot get rid of aol due to issues so thats out of option) and an Apple Powerbook to which I want to start a network. </s>
<s> My main question is that although I have the router set up on the Dell it does not seem to see the apple, thus it denies me in setting up the network. </s>
<s> From the Powerbook I can log on to the network name I gave to my dell, but I cant seem to access files/internet and the Dell does not seem to acknowledge that the Apple is there. </s>
<s> My main concern right now is to be able to share files/printer between my two computers and for them to correspond. </s>
<s> Some people say the aol sharing is impossible but someone told me of a program (AnalogX) that uses a proxy to share the connection but im utterly lost with that also so if anyone has used it and has any tips that would be helpful. </s>
<s> ANYONE that can help me in anyway is greatly appriciated, I searched online but I cant seem to find any anwsers to my problems. </s>
<s> I hope I dont have to send my router back to Newegg. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that although I have been around PCs my whole life and know a good deal about them I have never had much experience with Apples nor networks (always had only one computer and it ran dialup since my area does not get dsl) Thanks! </s>
<s> but here is a good place to start with the networking part of your question&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-27,GGLG:en&q=file+sharing+PC+to+MAC As far as setting up a shared dialup through a router, I've found that the routers DHCP functions need to be turned off, leaving only the incorporated 4 port switch to handle the network traffic. </s>
<s> Then I use Windows own version of proxy server called ICS to serve up the internet. </s>
<s> The powerbook is running OS X 4.2. </s>
<s> Sorry about that I thought I had posted that. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help so far, does anyone else have any tips before I spend my night trying to figure this out? </s>
