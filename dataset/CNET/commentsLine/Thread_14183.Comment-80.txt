in 1982 i bought a sinclair, which was somewhat similar to the ti99-4a.
i screwed around with that for about a month, until i realized that it was merely an amusement and was never going to be of any use.
i then bought a real computer, a transportable kaypro ii, with 64kb ram, cp/m operating system, one 5-1/4&quot; 190kb floppy drive, and bundled perfect writer and perfect calc.
a year later, i bought an okidata 92 printer, and a kaypro 4, with two 5-1/4&quot; floppy drives, including dbase ii.
after teaching myself how to program in dbase, i bought a copy of foxbase+, and used the kaypro/okidata and those software packages to run a contract builders hardware department for the next four years, until i finally enticed my boss to purchase a generic ms-dos &quot;lunchbox&quot; computer with a hard drive.
it was a lot of work, and a lot of fun.
