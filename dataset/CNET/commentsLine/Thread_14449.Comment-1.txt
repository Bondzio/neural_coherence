well my son built a nice machine.
he had problems with a seagate 250 gb sata cuda drive crashing ,twice, a total meltdown.
he ended having to reformat, and reinstall winxp, but lost all data.
so sent him another drive, a wd 250 gb sata drive.
he set them up as raid 1. i thought his data woudl be &quot;protected&quot;.
(he is in college, and doesn't really have the time, or energy to trouble shoot, so i'm trying to help him out!)
yesterday his drives crashed again, as he typed on it.
well both drives were totally unreadable.
no dir, both drives.
both registered as &quot;unformated.&quot; i thought it was the seagate but now i'm not sure.
if it was just the seagate, why would both drives, in raid 1, crash at the same time.
very odd, and very frustrating.
i bought him an external onetouch drive, for backup, reformatted, and reinstalled xp again.
this time we are using the wd as the boot drive.
i also disabled raid.
i ordered a seagate hd replacement, but i'm not really sure if it is the hd at all, the mother board, the sata drivers, xp glich, or what.
i know this is difficult question, but perhaps someone out there had a similar problem.
any grey cell electrical energy you can throw my way will be appreciated!
help!
