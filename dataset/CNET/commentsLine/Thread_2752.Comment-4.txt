we use the touch screens for factory testing setups, point of sale and such.
but the brutal truth is that for long use its far too hard on people.
try this.
pretend a spot on your desk is a mouse tap area of your screen.
now tap it.
fine.
no problem.
now tap it for an hour.
most people will end up with a sore finger.
