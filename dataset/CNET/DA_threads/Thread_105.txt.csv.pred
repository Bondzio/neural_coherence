1.1.1	Hello , I have an HP Vectra VL 400 desktop running a PIII 866Mhz Socket 370 with 133 FSB on an Intel 815 chipset .	St
1.1.2	Can I upgrade to a PIII 1Ghz socket 370 with 133 FSB ?	Ques
1.1.3	Are there any compatibility issues and will I need to upgrade anything else ( Bios ... ) Thank You	Ques
1.2.1	I would think the little bit of difference in processor size would be hardly noticable .	St
1.2.2	Perhaps a ram increase would be of more help .	St
1.3.1	Check the HP & Intel web sites for info on upgrades .	St
1.3.2	Intel MB can be very CPU specfic .	St
1.3.3	If what you findout looks good for a upgrade then go to Ebay .	St
1.3.4	John	St
