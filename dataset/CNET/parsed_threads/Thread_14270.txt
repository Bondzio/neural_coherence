<s> So I have an HP Desktop. </s>
<s> I recently moved from my apartment to a house and moved my computers+speakers along with it. </s>
<s> Now the speakers won't work. </s>
<s> I have made sure that the speakers are connected in the right jack (In fact I tried'em all and test the audio, but no output). </s>
<s> The driver is updated. </s>
<s> I went to the My device manager, uninstalled/installed the driver, disabled/enabled the driver, restarted the computer, the speakers are ON, connected to the power supply and the jack. </s>
<s> See the link for the device settings. </s>
<s> Have tried everything from my end. </s>

<s> See if you have something that will plug into your speaker system and test that to rule it out. </s>
<s> And, of course you're using the green jacks and have tried both front and back. </s>
<s> I don't see your imageshack pictures well but I do see a digital option. </s>
<s> You'll want to make sure that you're not outputting the wrong signal. </s>
<s> Anyway, try to test the speakers by connecting some digital music player if you have one and see if that works. </s>
