i recently purchased a second hard drive to add to my system.
my old 40 gig simply wasn't able to handle it anymore.
i plan on keeping this drive though and using the new one to store games, music, downloads, etc.
i've gotten to the point where i'm ready to install the new drive and i have a few questions.
should this drive be set up as the slave drive?
would i need to format it in any way or can i just store things right off the bat?
any other useful tips you would suggest?
i'm running windows xp pro.
