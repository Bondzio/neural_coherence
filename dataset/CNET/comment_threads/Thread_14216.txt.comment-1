I have a virgin superhub downstairs with my TV and Xbox attached.
I also have a DG834G router upstairs with a bt connection with two pcs and connected.
I want to use the netgear router to extend the reange of the super hub so that I only have 1 network in the house as the range of the superhub is not good enough.
Any ideas?
I have tried to set the netgear as an extender but cannot get it to work.
