So we XBOX 360 users cannot use the encryption tool in the Control panel on Windows XP with a thumb drive? I have to enter all of the codes manually? Do I add all the lines or just the first? Where do I go to do it manually, I go to the network area it shows me the info, but how do I manually enter in the security area. Once I create a WEP or a WPA how safe am I from neighbor trying to free load, steal info, or cause problems? What is the best encryption 2 home computers and my XBOX share? WEP, WAP, or something else? How safe am I. I only hook it up to play Xbox or let the kids use the net on the other computer, or to play against me. Sorry to be so obtuse and needing step by step help on a how to enter security info on my XBOX. I really can?t seem to find how to enter the security info on the 360 that is a lot of numbers to enter.... One last question sense you are the only person that helps me and seem to have a lot of the answers. 1. Why didn?t Microsoft make it so the thumb drive could be read in its USB port? Probably a rhetorical question but come on, Microsoft, dah? (I realize you don?t represent MS just mumbling to myself)Common sense unless there is a technical reason, and of course you may not know. My real question is I recharge my wireless 360 controllers by a cord accessory and a USB port on the XBOX is that a special USB port, or could I charge my XBOX controller using that cord and one of my PC USB 2.0 ports, if I have a big power supply, or is the XBOX one special or recommended? Thanks so much for you the other members help! I appreciate your time, help, expertise, and patience.

WEP is rather weak and the methods by which to break it are publicly available. And if given the option I suppose WPA2 would be even more preferable. Next, the play and charge kit is able to work through your PC USB ports. Although I'm unsure whether it would charge more quickly. Lastly, I'm sorry but I don't have an answer for your thumb drive question. Hopefully someone else will soon come along who does.
