The Safely Remove Hardware icon is in my tray as well which serves as a safeguard re uploading photos to your computer.
When your uploads have finished, click on the Safely Remove Hardware BEFORE removing your USB connection device and wait for a popup to inform you it is safe to remove the device.
In other words, it is an extra precaution well worth the little space it uses in your tray.
