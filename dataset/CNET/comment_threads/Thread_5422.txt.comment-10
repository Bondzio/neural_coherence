I think I did delete lot of not use program such as spyware and maybe by mistake also delete ... than starting had problem on my Dell 5100 loptop I used device manager verify the CDRW/DVD Matshita UJDA740 shown Window can not load device driver ... Code 39.
Then I down load driver from Dell but shown Supported driver is not connected.
So I think your suggestion was right.
But I do not know how to delete the filter registry file as yo mention on the ms article?
Thanks
