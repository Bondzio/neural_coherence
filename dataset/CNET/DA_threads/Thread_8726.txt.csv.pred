1.1.1	A little while ago, I was advised that I could use NTFS-3G coupled with MacFUSE in order to backup a MacBook to an NTFS formatted external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	Looks like this may be necessary, b/c my wife's MacBook is having serious issues (has become ridiculously slow - don't know why).	St
1.1.3	If I do this, and then get the machine repaired in a way that wipes her internal hard drive clean, should we be able to restore her machine from the NTFS-formatted external drive?	St
1.1.4	I assume that I'll have to re-install NTFS-3G and MacFuse before doing so, but after that, should I be able to restore the MacBook?	St
1.2.1	You can restore the machine with the Apple OS DVD then install fuse then copy your files back.	St
1.2.2	Sorry that I misunderstood your needs.	St
1.2.3	These TWO are different goals.	St
1.2.4	1. restore the MacBook.	St
1.2.5	2. restore my files.	St
1.3.1	Thanks - and no, you didn't misunderstand.	St
1.3.2	It's only in the last day or so that we thought her hard drive might be in trouble; originally, I was just curious about backing up her data as a &quot;just in case&quot; sort of thing.	St
1.3.3	Much appreciated.	St
