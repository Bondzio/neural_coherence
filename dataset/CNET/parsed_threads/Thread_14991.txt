<s> I did a fresh reinstallation of windows XP and I need to find files that are hidden. </s>
<s> I have about 15 gigs worth of music and I cannot access them. </s>
<s> I know they're in there because the same amount of space is used up on the hard drive. </s>
<s> The pie chart and &quot;free space&quot; are nearly the same as before I reinstalled windows. </s>
<s> Thanks, Clint </s>

<s> This is your second (nearly identical) post out of 3 and they all are posted in VERY old threads which nobody will answer, and certainly not the original poster. </s>
<s> Why don't you start your own new thread explaining your problem and giving all necessary background information? </s>
