as stated by robert, try to go for a refund or possible upgrade to a different laptop if they offer it.
here's what happened, via my wag.
some laptops, to include hps get darn hot or have a hot spot, which means the electronics cause some havoc somewhere and the weakest link gets whacked.
in the case for the hd, that could result in its not tracking correctly either because the electronics can't compensate or the areal(data r/w) operations get so out of spec, it doesn't make sense when cool until it returns to state of the r/w data was written if it hasn't failed during the meantime.
heat is electronics worse enemy and in laptops is part and parcel what causes alot of issues.
the time you had no problems, suggest it works until it finally reached a point where some weak link gave-in to include hd electronics on itself or mtrbd.
i/f.
i see no where if you ever cleaned or use laptop cooler fan setup, which may help.
you seem to think it isn't the hd, but every time the hd gets replaced it seems to work for some time.
so, take that as a clue.
