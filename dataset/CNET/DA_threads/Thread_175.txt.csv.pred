1.1.1	I arrived at work today to find that my IBM P77 monitor ( 6639-u3n ) had been tampered with ( someones idea of April fool I suppose ) The problem is that the text is in reverse and the window boxes etc are upside down .	St
1.1.2	I tried a duplicate monitor and the PC works ok with that .	St
1.1.3	Has anyone any idea of what was done and more importantly to me how to fix it without going to the jokers	St
1.2.1	Your monitor *may* have on-screen diagnostic controls .	St
1.2.2	Also , these are config .	St
1.2.3	control as well .	St
1.2.4	Using those , see if you can find a & quot ; default & quot ; mode .	St
1.2.5	then set it , now tweak it for best operation .	St
1.2.6	If none of this makes sense , IBM is pretty helpful via thier support website , find your model and get a & quot ; manual/guide & quot ; to help you .	St
1.2.7	Of course make sure that some simple pgm .	St
1.2.8	is n't working that really the culpit .	St
1.2.9	Report it to your boss or manager and play an April Fool 's , on your fellow workers , & quot ; Your 're fired & quot ; bye , adios , your check is in the mail .	St
1.2.10	Health benefits run-out in 1yr .	St
