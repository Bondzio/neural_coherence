the pc has 2 hd's and 2 dvd-rw's.
the data and power cables were removed.
1 hd and 1 dvd were connected to the data cble and the power cables were connected to both pieces.
but the pc only sees the hd and boots up ok into win xp home.
is it possible to use 1 hd and 1 dvd on the same data cable until the mobo is replaced?
