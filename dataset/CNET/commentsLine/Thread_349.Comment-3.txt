speaking of wireless bridges ... i have a situation where we're trying to set up a wireless network in a single room because the architectural geniuses who designed the place put the cable jack in a spot surrounded by two doors so it would be borderline impossible to run ethernet cable to the 2nd workstation.
now, the 2nd workstation itself is a desktop machine without any open pci slots so we've been trying to use various usb wireless network adapters that seem to cause all sorts of lovely driver-related lockup issues (to say nothing of severely complicating reloading windows on the 2nd machine).
i had been looking at potentially using a wireless bridge (i guess some of them are called &quot;gaming adapters&quot;?)
so that the 2nd machine can be connected to the network via its built-in ethernet port (which performed well when previously connected to a wired ethernet network at another location).
questions - has anyone tried this configuration?
does anyone have a wireless bridge they have had luck with?
(there seem to be lots and lots of wireless network adapters but very few wireless bridges.)
thanks!
