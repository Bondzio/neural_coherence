1.1.1	last week I convinced my friend to get a wireless router , I recomended either the Netgear WPN824 or the SMC networks WBR14-G2 .	St
1.1.2	He purchased the SMC .	St
1.1.3	the router worked great for a couple days after it was setup ( WPA passphrase , Firewall on , all settings configured for his laptop ) but after that the internet access has been dropping out , the laptop can see the network , connect to it ( wirelessly , DHCP address assignment ) but can not access the internet .	St
1.1.4	If you connect it to the wired port ( s ) on the router it works fine .	St
1.1.5	Iv'e tried resetting the router to defaults , giving the laptop a static IP but it still drops out randomly , the only thing i can thinkof is the encryption .	St
1.1.6	Please Help , or he 's going to abandon wireless forever .	St
