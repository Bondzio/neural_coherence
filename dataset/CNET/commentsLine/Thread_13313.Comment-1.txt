weighing out the advantages/disadvantages....based upon my needs... i have an external hard drive bought solely for use of storing my hd videos and then playing back directly through ps3.
.
ehd currently formatted ntfs... realize i must format to fat32 in order to play directly though ps3.
i don't need more than 4g per file space.
i don't need security/privacy features.
it seems logical to format to fat32....but i could leave it ntfs and add a step of putting a video back on my camcorder in order to play it directly on ps3.
i will do that if the benefits of ntfs are big enough.
i understand ntfs allows better/more usage of storage space...is less likely to crash...and is more of an overall efficient system.
but, i also understand that ntfs formats are not meant to be used in removable storage???
so, fat32 would be easier for me when viewing video...but i don't want to use it if there is any considerable risk to the media.
i need help weighing this out...please!!
!
