1.1.1	Dear all , I have a problem when copying files from my laptop to DVD+RW .	St
1.1.2	There are files inside my DVD+RW , so whenever I want to copy or add more files into the DVD+RW , it always ask me to erase all the files inside the DVD+RW before copying or adding files .	St
1.1.3	Hence , every time I want to copy or add files into the DVD+RW , I have to copy the files inside the DVD+RW to my laptop and then recopy those files from my laptop back to the DVD+RW together with some new added files .	St
1.1.4	I believe that DVD+RW should n't work this way but I really do n't know how to solve this problem .	St
1.1.5	Can anyone help ... .. ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisession	St
1.3.1	& quot ; Hence , every time I want to copy or add files into the DVD+RW , I have to copy the files inside the DVD+RW to my laptop and then recopy those files from my laptop back to the DVD+RW together with some new added files. & quot ; That 's the safest way to keep your files intact .	St
1.3.2	While InCD and other software will allow use of RW media as a disk drive the stories you read here when it burbs and they want to know how to recover the files are legendary .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	When I do my backups to DVD-RW I do the quick erase first , then copy files .	St
1.4.2	On the other hand , if the disk is not full , it should add the files .	St
1.4.3	Not closing the disk will enable this .	St
1.4.4	If you close the session then you need to erase the disk first .	St
1.5.1	Hi Coryphaeus , FYI , I know that closing the DVD will not allow me to write my files into the DVD .	St
1.5.2	So , I did not even close it but why I ca n't write my files into the DVD ever there are more than 50 % of the space ?	Ques
1.5.3	I believe that DVD+RW works like a floopy disk .	St
1.5.4	Hence , can anyone tell me what should I do ?	Ques
1.6.1	& quot ; why I ca n't write my files into the DVD ever there are more than 50 % of the space ? & quot ; The answer to this is & quot ; how things work. & quot ; Have you researched or do you know how file systems and then & quot ; packet writing & quot ; works ?	Ques
1.6.2	If not you may not be ready for the technical answers .	St
1.6.3	But let it suffice there are limitations to multisession CD/DVDRW use .	St
1.6.4	Is that good enough ?	Ques
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Dear Bob , Thank you for your reply .	St
1.7.2	I believe that my problem is not a matter whether my technical knowledge is up to a standard .	St
1.7.3	I believe that copying of data into DVD+RW is a simple thing , just like copying data into diskette .	St
1.7.4	Hence , if you could guide me the steps of copying the data , that will be great .	St
1.7.5	FYI , I did format my DVD+RW before the 1st usage .	St
1.7.6	I 'm not sure whether formating will affect my DVD .	St
1.7.7	Thank you .	St
1.8.1	Two questions .	St
1.8.2	1 .	St
1.8.3	What 's your OS ( Windows Vista or Windows XP ) ?	Ques
1.8.4	2 .	St
1.8.5	What burning program do you use , and how ?	Ques
1.8.6	Kees	St
1.9.1	Hi Kees , My OS is Win XP Service Pack 2 , Home Edition .	St
1.9.2	The Burning program is Sonic .	St
1.9.3	Thank you .	St
1.10.1	& quot ; I believe that copying of data into DVD+RW is a simple thing , just like copying data into diskette. & quot ; That is not true .	St
1.10.2	There are deeper issues here and limitations in the packet writing systems .	St
1.10.3	I ca n't duplicate how it works here but in a nutshell multisession does have limitations and is not exactly like a diskette .	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
1.11.1	Hi Bob , If it is true as what you mentioned that DVD+RW have limitations and is not exactly like a diskette .	St
1.11.2	In the first place , why DVD+RW is created ?	Ques
1.11.3	How come it is not user-friendly ?	Ques
1.12.1	DOS was considered user friendly just a few decades ago .	St
1.12.2	Some may not consider this an answer but if we add on that there is NO STANDARD in packet writing and the makers competed ( campaigned ? )	Ques
1.12.3	for theirs to be & quot ; it & quot ; you might begin to understand how we got here .	St
1.12.4	- & gt ; There it is .	St
1.12.5	You would not only want to research how packet writing works but how we got here and the battles/skirmishes along the way .	St
1.12.6	Bob	St
1.13.1	many many times .	St
1.13.2	We can also use it just like a floppy but what we are trying to tell you is that it is NOT as reliable when use in such method .	St
1.14.1	Sigh ... .	St
1.14.2	So many ding dong here and there .	St
1.14.3	So , what is the simple solution to write data to DVD+RW without erasing the exsiting data in the disc ?	Ques
1.15.1	Might be solved by changing which packet writing software you are using .	St
1.15.2	But then again the lessons learned here show it 's not reliable enough .	St
1.15.3	What I find is most wo n't agree until it happens to them .	St
1.15.4	Bob	St
1.16.1	Nero call its program Incd .	St
