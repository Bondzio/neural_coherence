12469	0	373261	3196610	NR	Jaxx89	12/12/09 1:58 PM	1.26062628E12	Is My PC ustilising full capability of the RAM?	Just a general question, I'm a n00b and so I ask. My PC has 6GB RAM 1333 MhZ Full Specs [IMG] http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/fullspecs.png [/IMG] Now as I check in CPU-Z and speccy, I see that my RAM is utilized at a max of 540MhZ. What I need to know is, when I have 1333MhZ Memory DIMMs, then why is it not utilizing to its full capacity. Or is it that 533MhZ is the actual speed and the 1333MhZ speed is what I can get only by OC'ing????? [IMG] http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/FullRAMusage.png [/IMG] Please let me know.

As well, DDR RAM is supposed to transfer twice the data of non DDR at the same clock speed...or something like that. Here's more on the numbers game. The RAM cited here is a bit dated but you can get a better idea of what the numbers might mean. As long as you use identical RAM in all 6 slots, you shouldn't experience performance drops. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM
