So, I need some help deciding whether Acer Aspire M5641 with these specs Intel core 2 quad q6600 ,2.4 Ghz 3GB DDR2 RAM 640 SATA HDD nVidia 9500 512 mb video card for only 735 USD is good or it would be better to buy another PC with this price range, or even I should just buy the PS3 since it's cheaper? I hope I get your help, thanks in advance.

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-graphics,2086.html and for the money pick what you can. Frankly I've seen the 100 to 200 buck cards to deliver gaming. I'm unsure why we'd go farther than that. Bob

With the ps3; (get the 80gb model for it has backward compatability, a killer blu ray player, mem. card feaders, 4 usb ports). Not to mention all the game titles, new and used.

That should cost around $700. The Ph2 720 is found here http://www.shopblt.com/cgi-bin/shop/shop.cgi?action=enter&thispage=011003000502_BT25940P.shtml&order_id=!ORDERID!, the rest is found on newegg
