i really enjoy bass but i don't necessarily need my teeth chattering.
i want to hear and feel the thump from the bass but not so heavy that it drowns out the mids and highs.
ive done some research but i get mixed reviews on whether or not the gigaworks can provide a clean heavy bass (not exactly sub-woofer quality but still great).
also klipsch is a known high quality brand and i'm hoping to use these speakers for a long time.
if anyone here has owned or heard both i would love your input, if you haven't then any advice can help.
