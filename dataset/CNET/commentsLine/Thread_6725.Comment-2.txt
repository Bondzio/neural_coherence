by transfer, do you mean move them or just copy them?
you can certainly put a second drive in another pc temporarily for this purpose.
you cannot copy entire programs this way but you can copy such as text, audio/video, picture files and those you have created with programs on the other pc.
the other pc must have the ability to open the files you copied or they would be of little value.
hope this answers your question.
