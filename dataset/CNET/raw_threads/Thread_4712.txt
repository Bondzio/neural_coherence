It matters. Please identify the make and model number and forum members can help you find the maker's CPU support list. bob

The later is built on a thinner substrate and supposed to be a bit better in performance but the jury has not decided. Your board will probably support the Northwood chips but may require (if available) a BIOS update for the Prescotts.
