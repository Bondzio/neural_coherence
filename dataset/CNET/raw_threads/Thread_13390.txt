The E310 is connected with Wireless and the 5100 is hard wired. When to access the workgroup on the E310 it gives a error message saying: &quot;Mshome is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available&quot;

I know that on my router, if you access the settings through the hard-wired PC, you can choose to encrypt it with a pass, but then your laptop would prompt you for it. But, you can also encrypt certain features on the wireless networking, allowing certain computers access to certain options or something. Try recreating your network if you can't find the answer. Or repair your network status and permissions. This is a link from Google. It discusses the problem you have: http://www.anetforums.com/posts.aspx?ThreadIndex=14476 Hope that helps. -BMF
