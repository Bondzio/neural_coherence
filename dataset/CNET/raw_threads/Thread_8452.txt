He confirmed that the black out problem was not due to a power adapter, but rather all earlier makes of HP LCD monitors in general. They had sent me a replacement power adapter. I plugged it in and it worked all of 3 seconds before the monitor blacked out again! They are sending me a replacement monitor. I am concerned that this monitor may begin blacking out after my warranty expires. The warranty continues on from the original purchase date, not the date of the replacement. He asked if I wanted to buy an extended warranty, but I refused. I told him I shouldn't have to buy something else to get what I paid for to begin with. He was very helpful and cordial (and actually was an American who spoke good English to boot).

It all depends on if you want to take the chance that HP is actually going to ship you a quality component this time.
