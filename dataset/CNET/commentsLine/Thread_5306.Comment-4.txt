i have a number of 2&quot; external hard drives ranging from 20 to 120 gb and from a variety of manufacturers including samsung, fujitsu, seagate and toshiba.
all have been wholly reliable and each has been cobbled together by buying a hard disk and enclosure separately.
to help you make a choice i would recommend you take a look at tomshardware.com which regularly reviews and compares all manner of computing hadrware.
in terms of back up software i have a dos recovery cd that can access firewire and usb storage and have powerquest drive image 2002 (now taken over by symantec and marketed as norton ghost).
i have a stable system configuration image with all my applications and then simply copy my personal files across at regular intervals.
if you have a technically minded friend or colleague they may be able to help compile a comparable dos boot cd or a bart pe boot disk.
