AM2 platform, X2 5000+, 2 gigs RAM, 250 gig hard drive, ATI Gecube Radeon X1900 XT vid card (I installed it). I plugged the computer in to an old CRT moniter, installed the vid card drivers, and everything went smoothly except for the fact that the colors were off. I messed with the moniter settings, but that did little. I unplugged my old computer, which was using a 17&quot; medion LCD display, who's colors were quite good. I plugged the LCD into the new computer, and the colors still didn't work. I tried using the moniter presets, and also fiddled with the color balance, and even installed the latest video card drivers. Although the blue and green colors were now fine, red displayed as black. Nothing I could do changed that. If you have any ideas of how to fix this, please help. Thanks!

Sounds like a bad or incompatible card if your drivers are right In the end you may be winding up with a NVIDIA
