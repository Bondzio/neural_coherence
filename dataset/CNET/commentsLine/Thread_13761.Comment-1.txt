i own a dell xps 600 desktop running a pentium d 3.2ghz processor with 2gb ram and i am looking for ways to improve the performance of my machine, if any.
i purchased it for the purpose of using very demanding 3d graphics and modeling programs such as 3dstudiomax, maya, rhinoceros and have come to be a little disappointed in it's ability to run these programs, both from a speed side and visual performance side.
is it possible to add ram to this machine, change processors, or otherwise increase the performance via operating system settings?
