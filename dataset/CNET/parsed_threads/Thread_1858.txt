<s> Long story short, as my Dell XPS desktop was loading up on Friday night, I foolishly went to plug my camera into the USB before it was finished and I believe that it what may have hung the process. </s>
<s> In any event, my computer had frozen so I rebooted and I have been unable to load up Windows since. </s>
<s> When I try to boot, I get the following blue screen message (among lots of other, less important text): &quot;A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. </s>
<s> DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Technical Information: STOP: 0x000000D1 (0x00000034, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xF72D8019) iastor.sys - Address F72D8019 base at F72C5000, DateStamp 42b2df42&quot; How can I resussitate my system? </s>
<s> I have people telling me to cut my losses and buy a new laptop, and others who say this is fixable and why spend the money when you don't have to. </s>
<s> Geek Squad wanted $400 just to do a diagnostic check and back up my desired data ... </s>
<s> I told them I wasn't interested in spending that kind of money. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> -Jason </s>
<s> If so choose &quot;Last known good configuration&quot;. </s>
<s> Reboot. </s>
<s> If not, do you have the XP CD or the Restoral CD? </s>
<s> If so boot from the XP CD and do a repair install. </s>
<s> It seems Dell had this happen before. </s>
<s> I provide a link to a possible fix. </s>
<s> But, you can a &quot;repair OS&quot; using your OS recovery/restore or install CD. </s>
<s> You didn't mention what OS you have, but during a reboot having the OS disc in the drive and its the 1st device to boot from(check bios) it should try to boot from CD. </s>
<s> Select the &quot;repair&quot; option. </s>
<s> link: http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=90770 You probably had a static(ESD) damage or too much data media to be mounted when you inserted the USB device. </s>
<s> There is the possibility the mtrbd. </s>
<s> is damaged, but try the fixes. </s>
<s> Also, google for other clues on the topic. </s>
<s> It seems to be an Intel storage driver in reference to I/O interface. </s>
<s> Please provide full details of your system for a more precise answer(s). </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> http://www.ydeologi.com/2006/04/26/dell-dimension-e510-iastorsys-windows-xp-blue-screen-error-stop-code-0x000000d1/ The above link is a response to the many users having this same issue. </s>
<s> There are many fixes or tips/hints/clues on the topic. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks, the link is informative, but does not help me with my problem. </s>
<s> FYI, I did try loading up the computer with the OS reinstallation CD in the disc drive and it did nothing, didn't even seem to detect it was in there. </s>
<s> Got the same blue screen, and subsequent black screen (with options to boot into Safe Mode or Use Last Good Configuration) that I had before, and again, none of those work. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The reason I provided the 2nd link is the response many got with some of the fixes. </s>
<s> Dell own driver(original) fails and Intel own provided or the updated Dell driver will correct the problem. </s>
<s> Now how you get at since a simple running system in order to run the install is another matter, that's why the &quot;repair&quot; option is the most likely to succeed. </s>
<s> You do have to point to the new updated driver in order to install it. </s>
<s> They did provide the instructions on all this and they have to be followed. </s>
<s> So, you will need to retry all this again until it works. </s>
<s> You may try to get the plain DOS level screen(black screen) with &gt;C prompt and then install the Dell updated driver file. </s>
<s> Now, if you have important data you want to save, then remove HD and mount in ext. </s>
<s> USB cases or adapter to retrieve -OR- place in another system as 2nd HD to recover such data. </s>
<s> -OR- boot from a live Linux CD and hope you can and then retrieve data from the mounted HD0. </s>
<s> From memory: I think I've resolved this problem before. </s>
<s> I believe I removed HD, placed in another system. </s>
<s> Booted that system and made sure the 2nd HD is acknowledged. </s>
<s> I inserted the new driver in a directory(remember it) and when done, shutdown system. </s>
<s> Returned HD to old system, booted up into DOS level, retrieved the file and installed it. </s>
<s> Shutdown system(complete shutdown not a restart) and then rebooted and it was OK. </s>
<s> If all the info and this stuff doesn't help, then you may have a true h/w fault and no amount of drivers or s/w will correct that. </s>
<s> Since is a i/f type of thing build-in the mtrbd. </s>
<s> yeah a replacement is required or new system depending on your course of action or size of your wallet. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The OS is shot. </s>
<s> Friend came over to check it out for me (for free, screw Geek Squad!) </s>
<s> and a message basically came up saying the drive is bad. </s>
<s> I have a Dell DataSafe deal where I have a backup drive in there, so he swapped that one in as the main drive and took the other one out. </s>
<s> It now appears to be working, albeit a bit glitchy at times (screen will randomly flicker) and the drive doesn't have the same capacity as my other one, but at least it works for now! </s>
<s> SO what happened next? </s>
<s> What did you do with the &quot;defective&quot; drive? </s>
<s> I saw your previous post about the safe mode option, did you try entering the safe mode? </s>
<s> Your system could have some trouble when you plug an external device while your desktop is loading, but it should not be that &quot;fatal&quot;. </s>
<s> PCs have external protections too e.g. </s>
<s> grounding etc. </s>
<s> Although it is possible that your Hard drive may have incurred a &quot;bad sector&quot; because of the external glitch. </s>
<s> If this is the case you need to reformat that drive but recover first your valuable data. </s>
<s> If your main drive is not in partition, I suggest you partition it, so that in the future formatting won't be a BIG problem. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
