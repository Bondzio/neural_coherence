<s> hey, i was wonder if its normal for a 7200 rpm hard drive to make noise. </s>
<s> You can usually hear it any were in the room it does not do it a lot but you can definitely hear it when it does. </s>
<s> It is less than 6 months old, and there are 2 operating systems running on it. </s>
<s> I runs really really fast. </s>
<s> Usually this question pops up as folk get a new PC. </s>
<s> &quot;It sounds different.&quot; You can improve this with better mounting of the drive. </s>
<s> I found years ago that putting a 3.5 inch drive in a plastic adapter to a 5.25 inch bay to really cut the noise levels. </s>

<s> Flat out some HDs are very quiet and what noise you do hear are &quot;whirrr&quot; or slight &quot;ac-changs&quot; during seeks, but overall still very low. </s>
<s> During intense operation it maybe slightly noisier. </s>
<s> Take this all with a grain of salt, because sometimes what you really hear is the &quot;resonance&quot; that metal-to-metal contact makes when too tighten or loose mounting. </s>
<s> This is common in desktop operation to have some noise. </s>
<s> However, you gave &quot;NO DETAILS&quot; of your setup, so any answer could vary. </s>
<s> If it now more noisier than when you 1st had it installed, then it maybe R/W to an area of the HD which allows more resonance to travel easier but it still falls into wear&tear of operation, expect some noise. </s>
<s> Also, don't mistake HD for fan noise, that can happen too. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
