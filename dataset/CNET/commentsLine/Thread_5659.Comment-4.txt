with the audigy2 zs its a snap.
just connect the digital audio out cable(digital coax) to a digital audio coax input on your a/v receiver.
viola!
now you've got audio from your pc playing through the home speakers connected to your home receiver.
you will need a receiver that has a digital audio input(any current receiver has several of them).
if your receiver only has a digital optical input, then you will have to get a converter cable for the digital coax to digital optical.
these converters are very cheap and can be bought anywhere.
i am about to purchase the audigy2 zs sound card myself.
this card is amazing and offers everything you could possibly want.
you won't need one of the higher end cards unless you need to do highly specific technical work.
i thought about using home speakers and a home receiver with my pc, but i am going to go ahead and buy the logitech z-5500 5.1 speakers and processor because this speaker setup is loaded with features and has absolutely incredible sound.
the clarity and power are truly top notch.
