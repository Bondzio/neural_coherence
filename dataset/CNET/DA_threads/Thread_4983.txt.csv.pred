1.1.1	I 'm using an Iomega 80GB HDD external hard drive for backup .	St
1.1.2	It 's attached to a PC running windows xp .	St
1.1.3	When it gets full it the backups do n't work , and deleting items just sends them to a recycle bin which I ca n't find an icon for .	St
1.1.4	Occasionally I 'll get a message to the effect that the disk is full , and do I want to empty the recycle bin ?	Ques
1.1.5	And that frees up enough space to continue the backups .	St
1.1.6	How do I access the recycle bin without waiting for the 'disk full ' message ?	Ques
1.1.7	If it makes a difference , I just switched from using Iomega 's software to attaching the drive as a plug'n'play .	St
1.2.1	All drives connected to a PC use a common recycle bin , although the & quot ; deleted & quot ; data still resides on the original drive .	St
1.2.2	On your desktop , empty the Recycle Bin and it will remove the deleted data from all drives .	St
1.3.1	If all drives have a common recycle bin , then why does n't the recycle bin have a file I just deleted from my hard drive ?	Ques
1.4.1	It uses the Desktop Recycle Bin , regardless of the partition , or drive ID , physical location .	St
1.4.2	That is only for standard deletion .	St
1.4.3	That moves the file to the recycle bin .	St
1.4.4	The more powerful Shift and Delete key option superimposes complete deletion .	St
1.4.5	There is no recycle bin file .	St
1.5.1	The default may be set to one Recycle Bin for all drives .	St
1.5.2	That does NOT mean that this is physically the case .	St
1.5.3	Read on : 1. if you disconnect an external drive before it is finished processing , then the Recycle Bin folders on that drive may become detached from the host machine 's Recycle Bin and can not be accessed thereafter .	St
1.5.4	You will then end up with & quot ; deleted & quot ; files in Recycle Bin folders on the external drive which are STILL USING SPACE on the external drive , AND with NO ACCESS from the host or any other machine .	St
1.5.5	2 .	St
1.5.6	If you manually configure each drives Recycle Bin Properties seperately , then each drive will have it 's own Recycle Bin with varying percentages of teach drive being used .	St
1.6.1	it sounds like you have a Recycle Bin which has become detached from the host machine 's Recycle Bin .	St
1.6.2	Whatever is in it is now unavailable and will NOT appear in the host machine 's Recycle Bin .	St
1.6.3	The space will never be recovered from the external drive .	St
1.6.4	One solution to this problme is this : 1 .	Sug
1.6.5	Do NOT do this unless you are technical and/or very sure of what you are doing .	St
1.6.6	First ensure you are an adminstrator user .	St
1.6.7	2 .	St
1.6.8	Bring up File Explorer ( Windows Key + E ) .	St
1.6.9	In the Menus , go to Tools - Folder Options - View .	St
1.6.10	Scroll down and select & quot ; Show hidden files and folders & quot ; , and also un-select & quot ; Hide operating system files & quot ; .	St
1.6.11	3 .	St
1.6.12	Now click on the external drive in the left panel & quot ; Folders & quot ; .	St
1.6.13	You should see at least one or both of these : $ RECYCLE.BIN and RECYCLER .	St
1.6.14	They will contain one or more subfolders which can not be viewed while windows is running called something like : & quot ; S-1-5-21-3173086387-2615592467-1408983588-1000 & quot ; .	St
1.6.15	4 .	St
1.6.16	For each of the two top level folders the process to remove them completely is the same .	St
1.6.17	a. Right-Click each top level folder and select properties .	St
1.6.18	Un-select & quot ; Read-Only & quot ; and click OK , then click OK to do same to all sub-folders .	St
1.6.19	Wait til done .	St
1.6.20	b .	St
1.6.21	Do same for each sub-folder inside each top-level folder .	St
1.6.22	c. Delete each top level folder and click OK to do same to all .	St
1.6.23	5 .	St
1.6.24	Bring up File Explorer ( Windows Key + E ) .	St
1.6.25	In the Menus , go to Tools - Folder Options - View .	St
1.6.26	Scroll down and select & quot ; Do not show hidden files and folders & quot ; , and also select & quot ; Hide operating system files & quot ; .	St
1.6.27	Now you will have all that unused space clogging up a useless Recycle Bin available again .	St
1.6.28	Hope this resolves your problem .	St
1.6.29	I 've just run into this problem myself on a 750Gb drive and recovered 38GB of wasted space .	St
1.6.30	==================================================== You may then want to consider your options with your external drive 's Recycle Bin : i ) Right-Click on the main Recycle Bin and select Properties .	St
1.6.31	On the Global Tab you can select & quot ; Configure drives independently & quot ; .	St
1.6.32	If you do you will then be able to set the Maximum size of the Recycle Bin on each logical drive ( partition ) .	St
1.6.33	You may also set files to bypass the Recycle Bin altogeter for that logical drive .	St
1.7.1	Coryphaeus ' reply sums it up nicely : & quot ; All drives connected to a PC use a common recycle bin , although the & quot ; deleted & quot ; data still resides on the original drive .	St
1.7.2	& quot ; Windows only has one Recycle Bin .	St
1.7.3	However , the Recycle Bin is not a folder in and of itself ; it is a virtual folder that simply displays all recoverable files previously deleted from currently-mapped storage devices .	St
1.7.4	Thus , you are correct that the files are actually stored in hidden system folders on the respective drives , and that occasional glitches can occur such that the files remain but do not appear in the Recycle Bin .	St
1.7.5	Nevertheless , those are known as recycler folders , not the unified Recycle Bin , which Coryphaeus alluded to in his original reply over four years ago .	St
1.7.6	And , just to be clear , those individual recycler folders exist , and are used , regardless of whether you choose to manage the drives ' maximum allocation independently .	St
1.7.7	John P.S .	St
1.7.8	I have pruned this thread so that the original discussion is not overshadowed by today 's dispute .	St
1.8.1	Hey luap_42 .	St
1.8.2	Thank you so much for your detailed answer !	St
1.8.3	I 've looked up this info everywhere but I couldn`t find and I felt totally lost and frustrated that I could do nothing about the deleted files which occupied my external HDD .	St
1.8.4	Many thanks	Polite
1.9.1	Hello Luap_42 I have this exact problem , except that my Iomega is specifically a Mac EHB .	St
1.9.2	I do have VMWare , but since it it Mac formatted , this detailed process wo n't apply to me .	St
1.9.3	Do you have ANY suggestions on how to achieve the same end solution of emptying the detached Trash files from the EHD using Terminal Mac commands ?	Ques
1.9.4	My Time capsule is enroute , as I recently moved back to the US-hence why I was using this EHB as a temporary back-up .	St
1.9.5	Directly deleting the back-up file from the drive is what caused this issue ... ... .	St
1.9.6	I 've done a lot of research on Mac forums and nothing has worked .	St
1.9.7	Any help is greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.10.1	Under system tools , bring up Disk Cleanup , pick the external drive and you will see an option to empty that drive 's recycle bin .	St
1.11.1	So I had a hard drive that was disconnected from the original host machine and had 170+GBs of junk in the recycle bin .	St
1.11.2	Disk Cleanup worked like a charm !	St
1.11.3	I do n't know why I did n't think of that !	St
1.12.1	Yes but it is not working with external drives , usb , cd .	St
1.12.2	How to create recycle bin for usb ... ?	Ques
