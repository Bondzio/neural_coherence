<s> I recently acquired a 250 GB Western Digital hard drive that had been formatted on a MAC. </s>
<s> On both Vista and XP machines it is seen in Device Manager and Disk Management but not recognized in Explorer so I can't access it to reformat it or use it. </s>
<s> In Disk Management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except HELP are grayed out. </s>
<s> Other than putting it back on a MAC (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that I can get Windows to assign it a drive letter so that I can reformat and use it? </s>
<s> Thanks James </s>
<s> I booted up GPARTED and dispatched the issue in less than 5 minutes. </s>
<s> Sorry but maybe there is a Windows way but I have my solution so I stopped looking. </s>

<s> Thanks for the input. </s>
<s> I neglected to mention that the HD was in a SATA USB enclosure. </s>
<s> I took a look at the software you suggested but I couldn't find where it supported usb devices. </s>
<s> However your suggestion that I try a partition software reminded me that years ago I had added an additional Western Digital HD to my system and that it had come with a CD containing some set up tools. </s>
<s> The program is called 'Data Lifeguard Tools' and one of the options allows me to partition / format a HD on a USB port. </s>
<s> It worked smooth as silk. </s>
<s> I am currently moving some files to it. </s>
<s> I will eventually add it to my wireless network using a Belkin wireless USB hub. </s>
<s> This will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage / transfer device. </s>
<s> Again thanks for the input. </s>
<s> James </s>
<s> Yes I've used GPARTED on both USB to IDE and USB to SATA drives. </s>
<s> Data Life Guard tools is fine too! </s>
