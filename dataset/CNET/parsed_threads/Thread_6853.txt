<s> Allright... something is wrong with my display - whenever I boot up my comp now, its checkerboard colors... </s>
<s> I can tell that it is changing and loading, but something is wrong. </s>
<s> I sent my videocard back to ATI, and got a new one back but it didnt help any. </s>
<s> Ive got an AMD 2500+ OC'ed to a 3000+ I have - ATI Radeon AIW 9800 Pro 512 MB Ram Basically, I need a mobo that is AGP compatible and a decent CPU to go with it; and also it needs to have decent onboard audio because I have a 4.1 logitech system. </s>
<s> I have AMD now, but would not care really if it was AMD or Intel, whatever is better for the money. </s>
<s> I plan on ditching the mobo/cpu i have now bvecause i feel like it would be too much of a hastle to swap CPUs with a new mobo... not to mention the CPU might be the prob anyway. </s>
<s> I spent around $200 when I built the comp 3 years ago... </s>
<s> I would prefer to spend about that or less if I could. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any help! </s>

<s> Awesome, thanks for the recommendation... the reason I dont care about pci-express as much is because i think that the card I have still sells for a couple hundred and it would not be worth upgrading it... but i may be wrong on that part...? </s>
<s> anything anyone can recommend for under $150? </s>
<s> Im not sure if 64 bit or dual core is better? </s>
<s> And would it be worth it to wait till next month or anything? </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I realize you are probably trying to build the cheapest upgrade possible, but shaving $50 dollars off of the price means degrading pretty severely in performance. </s>
<s> I don't know what you use your computer for (gaming, office, Home theater, etc.) </s>
<s> so it's kind of hard to make a solid recommendation. </s>
<s> The CPU/mobo combo I listed above is what I would call a budget, best-bang-for-the-buck, upgrade. </s>
<s> If you want nothing to do with gaming or multimedia then you could easily get a celeron D and save another $50 or so. </s>
<s> The PCI-express thing is more about &quot;room to grow&quot;, AGP is an EOL (end of life) technology, which means that at some point graphics card vendors are going to stop producing cards that use the AGP bus. </s>
<s> If you at some point to want to upgrade your video card, you could end up having to do a complete system upgrade. </s>
<s> As a stop-gap, inexpensive upgrade however an AGP motherboard is fine. </s>
<s> as for dual core (64bit extensions are not as important for your needs I would think); it's pretty much the industry standard now and for $120 is a helluva deal. </s>
<s> hrmmm... well this gets me thinking if you would recommend to get a mobo with both pci-e and AGP? </s>
<s> I searched newegg and found some for AMD chips... any with comperable prices with the pentium and have both? </s>
