thanks for the comment...funny, I heard just the opposite, that XP is great at recognizing new hardware....thought that was what the plug and play is about.
I have no reason to reformat the old drive....if the new machine will not recognize the old drive I then would use the new machine in the new machine but copy old drive files to new.
have you had any actual experience swapping drives or copying files from one drive to the next???
