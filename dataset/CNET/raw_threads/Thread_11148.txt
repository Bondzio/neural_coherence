Problem is, I've never replaced a hard drive before. My desktop's specifications are here: http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c03135837&lang=en&cc=us&taskId=110&contentType=SupportFAQ&prodSeriesId=5187022&prodTypeId=12454 What kind of hard drive should I purchase? Will any SATA hard drive be compatible with my computer? I can't afford something exceedingly expensive. Space should be between 1-2 TB. Would this work with my computer? http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-3-5-Inch-Internal-Desktop/dp/B00471EYUU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1345602095&sr=8-6&keywords=sata+hard+drive+2+TB Thanks, and sorry for all the links.
4265	1	570880	5350308	5350248	Willy	8/22/12 2:07 AM	1.34560122E12	That's a go	Hard drive 1 TB Size: 1 TB Interface: SATA Transfer rating: 3.0 Gb/sec Rotational Speed: 7200 RPM \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Those are your specs above. They are for a SATA type drive. You can install a 2-2Tb no problem, even a 3Tb one if you like as your OS is Win7, will readily accept it. The HD link appears not to be an issue, will work. However, I do suggest you update the bios so it can accept any changes that HP provides or deems so. HP if you follow the instructions should provide info on OS re-install and HD replacement, please review it for model# or generic details. tada -----Willy

I couldn't find exact instructions on how to replace my old hard drive with the new one, once I get it. There are a lot of tutorials online but a point in the right direction would be great. Hopefully it all works out when I get my HD.
