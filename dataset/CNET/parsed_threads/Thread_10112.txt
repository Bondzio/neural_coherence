<s> Hi, everyone: I'm in the market for a tablet. </s>
<s> One I like a lot is the ASUS Transformer. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell, the only thing it lacks is 3G, so I'm thinking about getting &quot;Broadband to Go&quot; from Virgin Mobile, which includes a 3G modem, I think, if I'm reading it right. </s>
<s> I have a Virgin Mobile cell phone, and really like it and the company. </s>
<s> Here's the scoop on the tab: ASUS Eee Pad Transformer (TF101-A1) Tablet NVIDIA Tegra 2 10.1&quot; Wide SVGA 1GB DDR2 Memory 16GB Flash HDD NVIDIA ULP GeForce Here's a link to it: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230018&cm_re=asus_transformer-_-34-230-018-_-Product This thing has an excellent array of features... </s>
<s> The Virgin mobile broadband is super cheap at $10 for 10 days or $20 for a month, and is pay-as-you go, which is great b/c I'll probably only use the tablet when we're travelling. </s>
<s> It includes a USB &quot;device,&quot; which I'm assuming is a modem. </s>
<s> Here's a link to Virgin: http://www.virginmobileusa.com/mobile-broadband/ I'm a freelance writer, not a power user , so I want the tab just for checking email, getting driving directions, etc., and, of course, as a new toy to take to the supermarket with my grocery list. </s>
<s> Can anyone say if this hardware configuration seems like it would work? </s>
<s> Or suggest a solution for me that would be about $300? </s>
<s> For &quot;serious&quot; work, I have a nice HP laptop. </s>
<s> Also, is it possible to link up a tablet like this one to my laptop older HP NC6000 laptop, just for fun? </s>
<s> Comments would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I'm really kind of overwhelmed by all the information and reviews out there. </s>
<s> My budget is about $300 to maybe $400, not including the monthly broadband charge. </s>
<s> TIA Jaina </s>
<s> But I found a GPS to work better at that so I have a GPS. </s>
<s> As to writing I see folk add a keyboard since, well, I guess many haven't used a touchscreen for writing long enough to see if they can make that leap. </s>
<s> I went back to scraps of paper for shopping. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the Asus doesn't have USB ports, which I definitely want, b/c I need USB for mobile broadband. </s>
<s> So, it's out. </s>
<s> I ended up buying a &quot;Superpad&quot; on Amazon for $199, more as an experiment as anything. </s>
<s> It got mixed reviews, but I thought, what the heck :-)Can always send it back. </s>
<s> Thx J </s>
<s> At least the units I tried (all 2). </s>
<s> The reason is well discussed so let's move to what works. </s>
<s> Bluetooth tethering. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Jaina, so did the tablet work with the virgin broadband? </s>
<s> I have had Virgin Mobile Broadband for quite a while now and am looking for a tablet that would let me use both. </s>
<s> Please, let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks Janja </s>
<s> This one -&gt; http://www.virginmobileusa.com/mobile-broadband/mifi-2200.html will work fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I actually have the Broadband2Go which is the USB Stick. </s>
<s> Its not a hotspot but a wireless modem. </s>
<s> I called Virgin Mobile yesterday and they said that the stick only works with windws os, which is a bummer since all of those are very expensive. </s>
<s> I wonder, if you can change the os on the tablets? </s>
<s> The tablet above does not have windows available. </s>
