I have a Netgear Rangemax WPN311 g wireless card running in a W2K SP4 PC with the Novell client V4.83. Because the card doesnt come on line and request an IP address until after its booted up means that you have to log into the Novell client using workstation only, then once the desktop has loaded and card has associated itself with the AP can you log into Novell. Is there a way to force the card to associate with the AP during bootup so that at the Novell login you dont have to go in locally then login to Novell? Thanks for any help/suggestion
