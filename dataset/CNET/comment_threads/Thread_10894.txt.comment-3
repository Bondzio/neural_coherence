No, I haven't received the new monitor yet- should receive it this week.
But I did go into the control panel/display/settings/advance and un-checked &quot;hide modes this monitor can not display.&quot; Since I did not see the one I specified above, I am assuming this is an issue with the video-card and not with the monitor driver.
I would hope you are right, but from what I've read, it sounds like I likely need a new card.
