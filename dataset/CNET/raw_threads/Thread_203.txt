Included in my self installation kit was a Siemens SpeedStream 4100. However, it's functionality seems to be crippled; the thing doesn't seem to have an option to block or reconfigure ports. Is this limitation a firmware &quot;feature&quot; set by the ISP? I know that this particular modem has a much larger range of configurable options than what is being shown when I try to access the settings. So here's my main question. Do I have to use this modem to receive internet service? Or can I go out and buy a different, fully functional, DSL modem? Also, if I am indeed to suffer with this modem, is there any way to access the full features of this thing? Many thanks in advance : )

How exactly can I get the modem into bridge mode? Can I get some details at exactly what bridge mode is? I do need to buy a wireless router anyways, as I have more than one computer that's needing internet at the same time. Also. If I went out and got the exact same modem directly from a retailer instead of through ATT/Yahoo, will I be able to use it to it's fullest capabilities? Thanks a bunch, I know these questions are pretty basic and tedious in nature, and I really appreciate the help : )

I googled and downloaded the manual for this but it is not the software that SBC had him install and the logon is not the same. Does anyone know how to open these ports from the SBC installation. Thanks

Thanks for your help!
