<s> Hi, There are some companies that have their wireless network enabled for their staff to access to the file server. </s>
<s> What i wish to know is this. </s>
<s> I noticed that in order for the staff to be able to use the wireless network is to put in a password. </s>
<s> Each of the staff are given a kind of password generator gadget to generate password for them. </s>
<s> For curiosity's sake, How does this work? </s>
<s> i mean this would be a more secure way to use wireless network in a company or other private properties. </s>
<s> What is this system called? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance </s>
<s> SecureID token. </s>
<s> It generates a random and changing code. </s>
<s> When I login I must enter the current code that's displayed. </s>
<s> Occasionally it will fail and I will be asked to wait and enter the next code. </s>
<s> I don't know what happens at the other end. </s>
<s> I presume what I type must match what's expected. </s>
<s> It's an IT secret and they're not telling. </s>
<s> My device isn't to access the wireless network specifically but the VPN. </s>
<s> The device will fit on a key chain, is about two inches long and resembles a USB flash drive. </s>
<s> Is this what you mean? </s>
<s> I had one before I retired from SWBell. </s>
<s> Works exactly as you described. </s>
<s> It generates a new six digit code every thirty seconds or so. </s>
<s> How the remote server knows what it is is beyond me, and like you said, the IT group isn't talking. </s>
<s> But in my case it was only used for dial-up when I had my company laptop away from the office LAN. </s>
<s> Mine looked like a credit card with an LCD display. </s>
<s> After you dialed in you had to wait for the server to give you the prompt to input the code. </s>
<s> A real PITA. </s>
