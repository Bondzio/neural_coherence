1.1.1	Folks, Not sure if what I am looking to do is possible, but I have been creating mixed music compilation cassette tapes (years ago) and CDs for years, taking different songs from different artists (from my own CD library)and making my own 'mixed' CDs, as I am sure a lot of folks do.	St
1.1.2	In the past three years, I have purchased many music DVDs, Concert for George, Santana, etc., that I watch on my home-theater.	St
1.1.3	I would like to make some compilation DVDs taking one favorite song from one DVD, and another song from another, etc.	St
1.1.4	so I can put in the DVD and watch the different performances of only my fav's from the different DVDs.	St
1.1.5	I am not sure this is physically possible as some of the DVDs are in Dolby 5.1, some DTS, etc., and many give you a choice of how you want the sound.	St
1.1.6	Not sure even I I could get around the copywrite issue, how the video's would align together, given one may be in Dolby sound, and the next song in DTS (if even the copying would recognize this or be able to copy the audio part of the track in it's original format).	St
1.1.7	Plus, not sure if it is possible to get HW/SW that will enable me to cut just particular songs from different DVDs, let alone copy them (with the copywrite blocks) to a single DVD.	St
1.1.8	Any ideas will be appreciated.	St
1.1.9	Thanks Frank	St

1.3.1	Thanks for the lead Art, but actually, that post and replies are what prompted me to ask my Q.	St
1.3.2	While part of that discussion is about copying DVDs, I also need to understand if a compilation from many DVDs is possible, especially since the audio portion may be different on each song being copied.	St
1.3.3	Not sure if the finished product, even if possible, will sound right.	St
1.3.4	Frank	St
1.4.1	I am not sure whether dvdshrink would support dts/5.1; I never had the need to know but you could try it and let us know.	Sug
