<s> I'm getting ready to build a computer and was wondering if a mobo with a SiS chipset, specifically SiS 648 chipset, work with an ATI 9600 video card? </s>
<s> It seems I remember reading that SiS chipsets don't &quot;play well&quot; with AGP cards. </s>
<s> Thanks for any input. </s>

<s> The problem I see here is that even if the chipset has been known to work, will your motherboard with said chipset work. </s>
<s> You can help the forum help you by supplying the make/model of this board. </s>
<s> Be sure you don't have other issues such as a tiny power supply which doesn't have an extra 30 or so Watts for the new card. </s>
