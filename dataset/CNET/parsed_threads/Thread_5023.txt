<s> My computer seems to be noisier than it has been. </s>
<s> It sounds like something is spinning(hard disk?) </s>
<s> and it is hitting against something. </s>
<s> It makes a clicking sound....not always but often. </s>
<s> It isn't working as it was. </s>
<s> It takes about 5 minutes to fully load at start up. </s>
<s> I ran t anti-virus and 3 anti-spyware programs on it. </s>
<s> There is no virus or spyware on it.I used Regedit and cleaned the registry and cleaned up other things wrong on it. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the hard disk is about to crash??? </s>
<s> The computer is an HP a1250n that is two years old. </s>
<s> It has an athlon chip... X2 and 2 g's ram. </s>
<s> Is the hard disk about to crash?? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill K </s>
<s> Always be ready for the crash. </s>
<s> And if it's under warranty, let them fix it. </s>
<s> -&gt; A recent clicker was fixed when I pulled the lid off and found a cable too close to a fan. </s>

<s> If this is an older system, open the case and inspect to locate the noise. </s>
<s> While open, clean the dust bunnies out. </s>
<s> Inspect fans closely as they're obvious noise makers when failing. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you're guessing its this or that. </s>
<s> The noise maker should be apparent. </s>
<s> As the other posters offered, back-up while you can or save real important data. </s>
<s> If you think, it's the HD, disconnect it completely(no power) when 1st starting the system. </s>
<s> Even though it won't boot for obivous reasons, no noise as result, could very well be the HD. </s>
<s> Of course a HD failing should suggest more problems than noise. </s>
<s> If any warranty, use it. </s>

<s> Thanks to everybody that answered my post. </s>
<s> I ninstalled a new hard drive. </s>
<s> I had everything backed up on an external hard drive.n the physical installing of thenhard drive was simple but to get everything into the new hard drive took a long time. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Bill K </s>
