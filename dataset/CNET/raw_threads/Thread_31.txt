Both times I get the same thing, &quot;not Digitally Signed&quot; &quot;Device cannot start Error 10&quot;. I have tried installing in both PCI slots, both COM ports, a Diamond and a U.S. Robotics modems. I've installed the driver from the CD and installed a downloaded driver from the USR site. Nothing works. Both modems claim on the box to be XP compatible, but I cannot find a modem in any store with the &quot;official&quot; XP logo on it. I have installed several modems in other computers before without a problem. I have NOT yet called the support number (I hate that) and I do have the option of having the tech people at my wife's work do it (she works for a large computer reseller) but it is killing me that I can't get this thing to work. It's just a modem for gosh sakes! Any ideas? Thanks.

I'd read a current motehrboard driver hunt at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=148652&messageID=1658695 Bob

They said that I had simply not pushed the modem far enough into the slot. I found this hard to believe, since I inserted it into both slots repeatedly and did the same with the previous modem. It realy felt like it was in there and everything looked lined up. And, as I said, I have installed modems in a few other computers without problems. But, there it is.
