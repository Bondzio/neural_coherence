1.1.1	I 've been troubleshooting a friend 's computer on a wireless network , but I have been perplexed by some strange difficulties .	St
1.1.2	The wireless care detects the routers signal with signal strength around 60 % .	St
1.1.3	Both the router and wireless card are Netgear equipment and everything thing suggests that the connection should work fine but it does n't .	St
1.1.4	This particular network is open ( i.e. , it has no security enabled ) and the wireless card 's wireless assistant indicates there is no problem connecting however the assistant also indicates the assigned IP is nowhere near what it should be .	St
1.1.5	The IP should be 192.168.0.3 however the IP it says was assigned is something like 169.254.0.20 .	St
1.1.6	IPCONFIG indicates that same IP .	St
1.1.7	There are no other networks detected by the card and the signal strength is pretty steady .	St
1.1.8	My friend has indicated that the connection worked fine last week .	St
1.1.9	I already tried rebooting the router several times but that had no effect .	St
1.1.10	I am puzzled ... is there something wrong with the wireless card or perhaps its driver or is it something else ?	Ques
1.1.11	Oh and the computer is running on Windows ME .	St
1.1.12	Anyone have any helpful advice .	St
1.1.13	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	is not valid for Internet access .	St
1.2.2	Open winipcfg from Start/Run and try releasing then renewing the IP for the network card in question .	St
1.2.3	The underlying issue may be spyware/viral in nature .	St
1.2.4	If so try Safe Mode with Networking and run the usual online scanners to clean off the machine .	St
1.3.1	yeah my friend 's machine would not renew the IP stating that it was unable to contact the DHCP server .	St
1.3.2	( this was over a wireless network card ) .	St
1.3.3	i tried the same thing on the internal network card and it gave me an IP of 0.0.0.0 and would not renew the IP for the same reason as stated above .	St
1.3.4	i think she has big problems ... any advice ?	Ques
1.4.1	You could try re-installing the TCP/IP Protocol , and Microsoft Client , but that 's not going to help if you have spyware or a virus .	St
1.4.2	You could download Stinger : http : //vil.nai.com/vil/stinger/ and it fits on a floppy , since you do n't seem to be able to get to the Internet .	St
1.4.3	Does the computer have any Antivirus software running ?	Ques
1.4.4	Are the signatures current ?	Ques
1.4.5	Any Antispyware software ?	Ques
1.5.1	Hi , I have had similiar problem with my PC but mine is hard wired connecting with a netgear router.I tried everything you can think of , New NIC , replaced cables , anti virus/spyware scans in safe mode , including re-installing the OP system XP PRO and after 6 months and with help from other guys.I gave up and tried a USB to RJ45 adapter and I am online no problem all for the sake of 14 .Wished I had tried it earlier.So I would recommend borrowing a wireless USB adapter first to try it .	St
1.5.2	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	Its esay to set up but no one is interested.Go here and user opinion at newegg http : //www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Subcategory.asp ? Subcategory=294	Ques
1.7.1	Hi , I tried posting a reply twice with no luck so hopefully this one is not duplicating my previous ... I have a Netgear at home ( with three computers linked to it ) , but recently I had to hook up a Linksys to a friend computer so their laptop could operate wireless , etc , eytc ... I had a similair problem to yours and had to go to my Internet page , type in 192.168.1.1 and access the router home page ... From their I had to click on Mac Address Clone ( not sure if this would be the same with Netgear or not ) and noticed Mac Address was & quot ; disabled & quot ; ... Once I enabled it , all IP Address problems were self corrected within seconds ... Not sure if this will be the answer to yours but I certainly would look into it ...	St
