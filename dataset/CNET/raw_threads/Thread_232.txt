10431	0	262137	2572735	NR	renegade_0503	8/29/07 4:15 AM	1.1883609E12	Linux machine config	I am trying to come up with a linux machine config for data crunching purposes using C. This is my first time in building a machine. I'd like to know the following: 1. I dont intend to overclock the processor which is an Intel Core 2 Duo E6550 Conroe 2.33GHz 4M shared L2 Cache LGA 775 Processor. It comes with a heat sink and a fan. Do I still need to buy an additional processor fan for $25 (see http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16835103016 ) 2. For the motherboard I am considering Intel BOXDP965LTCK LGA 775 Intel P965 Express ATX (click on the &quot;Spec&quot; tab in http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813121035 ). There is a note in the spec section stating &quot;Only DDR2-800 memory supporting JEDEC approved 1.8V operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on Intel Desktop Boards based on Intel 965 Express Chipsets.&quot; Does this mean it will not be compatible with a 1 GB DDR2-800MHz RAM using 2.2V with 4-4-4-12 timing? If not, please specify a motherboard with LGA775 socket/Intel Core 2 Duo support/4MB L2 cache/FSB=&gt;1066MHz configuration. The other parts of the machine are: 1. ATX tower 2. PSU: 550W, and three 12 V rails. Is this an overkill for my config? ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817371002 ) 3. 250G SATA hard drive 4. SATA DVD burner 5. Additional 1 GB RAM (cumulative RAM = 2GB) Apart from the peripheral components (monitor, keyboard, mouse), am I missing anything? (Don't require video/sound cards). The total cost for the machine is roughly $700. Please suggest. Thanks!

The memory sockets support a range of voltages but let's knock it down to a few sentences. Many pages note the 1.8v because it's the latest and greatest but support for the older 2.x volt sticks is still on the board. What this means however is you can't mix and match memory sticks. Use the same technology in all sockets unless your motherboard manual states you can mix. Bob

Since I am not using any video cards, is the PSU (550W, three 12 V rails) an overkill for the configuration? If yes, is there a way to determine the minimum power supply required to support the machine? (Assume no external devices attached to the tower except keyboard, mouse)
