If there is a lesson that has repeated over the years is that storage is not &quot;storage&quot; but a copy.
I can't guess how long you've been at this but when you wrote &quot;stable storage&quot; it makes me think you are just beginning to see the problem.
Keep at it.
Make more copies and your data may be safe.
