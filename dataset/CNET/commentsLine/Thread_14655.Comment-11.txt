hi i also have the same problem with the loptop i'm currently fixing.. and i have fix it hope this one help you out... first i would like to tell you this, all usb port have some bandwidth or something like power limits and it is shared to all usb ports that you have it also shared by the cd/dvd-roms attached to it..note this is a loptop and not desktop comp... by unplugging some of the devices may help solved the power allocations on each usb devices... i am using dell loptop (latitude cpx)with winxp sp2... this solvd the issue.. but this is not just the fix of this kind of problem.. this is just a minor fix... a major fix is to recalibrate the usb port like rewiring it.. or pull it off the board then solder it again with soldering iron.. but just be careful on soldering it again be sure to put it the right way or exactly the way it used to be because it will make things worst if you make it grounded.. i did this to some usb port that i fix... because some loptops that i have fixed has a broken usb port or it's unusable anymore so i pulled some usb port to another loptop that has been junked and replace the other.
