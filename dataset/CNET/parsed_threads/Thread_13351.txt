<s> When system boots up, the wizard finds unknown hardware and searchs for driver, I cancel. </s>
<s> Then wizard searches for driver for PCI Multimedia Audio Device and I again cancel. </s>
<s> In the device driver menu, there is nothing checked red or yellow. </s>
<s> The only clues I have are: keyboard driver idvkd.sys driver not installed, and the CD-rom is set as secondary slave. </s>
<s> There is no primary slave. </s>
<s> There is no secondary master. </s>
<s> Hard driver is primary master. </s>
<s> Instead of cancelling, I let windows search for the best driver. </s>
<s> Now I have 2 devices with a yellow ? </s>
<s> beside them in the device manager. </s>
<s> Those devices need attention. </s>
<s> If those devices are unknown to you, don't worry, just hit the &quot;update&quot; button to find the best drivers when you click on that device. </s>
<s> If none are found, then find them either on your system recovery/restore CDs or mtrbd. </s>
<s> CD and point to them as the new source to check. </s>
<s> -OR- load the required CD and match the device to driver and allow it to load. </s>
<s> If all fails, thn simply remove or delete the device in question, upon next boot-up it should retry again to find proper drivers, then point to the known CDs that have such drivers. </s>
<s> You can provide the drivers from the vendors support website for that device and d/l them and then extract such drivers and then use that source to load them. </s>
<s> Did all this happen on thier own or did you installed &quot;new&quot; h/w, etc? </s>
<s> You may want to try this forst before anything else. </s>
<s> Use the &quot;restore&quot; feature of winXP or winMe to a date where problems weren't present. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Don't have any recovery cd's for this system. </s>
<s> I installed win98 from an older system. </s>
<s> This computer was used at a technical college. </s>
<s> There is no sound card in the computer at all so why does it keep finding a pci audio device? </s>
<s> OK, sorry for no restore points. </s>
<s> Anyways, besides an actual audio card, there are audio section build on mtrbds. </s>
<s> I suggest you get the system checker: http://www.majorgeeks.com/ find everest system checker pgm. </s>
<s> and d/l it. </s>
<s> It will check your system for all devices. </s>
<s> Yes, the audio portion will be seen as pci type. </s>
<s> if present. </s>
<s> A quick physical check of the audio ports found on the system case, look for 3-4 small RCA plug-ins, maybe labeled as spkr, input, output and/or mic, etc. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> You have a machine with on-board sound. </s>
<s> I suspect you have a machine that requires mobo drivers, w98 won't do this for you. </s>
<s> So...what you need to do is ID the mobo and then visit the makers site and then look around for sound drivers. </s>
<s> While at the makers site you might want to look around for other drivers that support your mobo. </s>
<s> I have been trying to find out exactly who is the manufacturer of the motherboard. </s>
<s> You could try TONI H advise in XPforums. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> gmp </s>
<s> If you do what WILLY said with the Everest thing you'll get so much info about your machine it will make you dizzy. </s>
<s> Somewhere in the mass of info it presents will be the make/model/serial# etc.etc. </s>
<s> of the mobo. </s>
<s> Is it still available as freeware? </s>
<s> ''Lavalys leaves freeware development efforts dedicating all resources to its EVEREST commercial products line'' - December 5, 2005 http://www.lavalys.com/news.php?article=31&selcat=PR&lang=en You can still use &quot;Belarc Advisor&quot; or &quot;Sandra Lite.&quot; Both may be found through Download.com. </s>
<s> Get everest at majorgeeks d/l website. </s>
<s> http://www.majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=4181 If it gets hosed, then search on majorgeeks website, enter: everest as keuword. </s>
<s> You need the home version which is still there. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It was available at MajorGeeks. </s>
<s> I now know motherboard name (Chaintec 60jv) (ID=i815-47B27X-JV69RVCOAC-00) I will try their support later and see if I can get this figured out. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
