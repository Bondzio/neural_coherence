<s> The question is pretty self-explanatory. </s>
<s> I'd like to know if there is a difference between what is considered &quot;shared memory&quot; and what is considered &quot;shared video memory&quot;. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Depends on the what you mean with shared memory. </s>
<s> Shared between what? </s>
<s> Can you provide a link where it's used in the sense you mean? </s>

<s> If you don't have actual &quot;dedicated memory&quot; on some device, then whatever device(usually video) is using system memory for it needs. </s>
<s> It will use what it needs or expands on what it already has. </s>
<s> No matter any &quot;shared&quot; memory from actual system memory installed gets used. </s>
<s> If you increase system memory, do so it usually does better qand if shared presents a larger memory resource. </s>
<s> Don't confuse the term &quot;memory&quot; for a stored media device which in turn gets used as memory as well. </s>
<s> This is generally speaking some type of &quot;virtual memory&quot; on a temporary basis. </s>
<s> However, as already asked of you, in what way has the terms shared and shared video come to light? </s>
