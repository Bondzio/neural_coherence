A socket is the place in the motherboard where the processor (CPU) is inserted.
A Socket A motherboard has 462 pin holes for insertion of a 462 pin CPU, such as the Athlon XP 3200+ CPU.
Socket 939 has, you guessed it, 939 pin holes for a 939 pin processor.
Socket 939 motherboards support todays best AMD processors Socket 939 motherboards support todays dual core AMD processors.
Socket A technology in the Athlon XP 3200+ is old.
In fact it is three generations old: Oldest --&gt; Socket A --&gt; Socket 940, --&gt; Socket 754 --&gt; Socket 939 --&gt; Newest Athlon 64 CPUs (not available in Socket A) support 64-bit Windows OS and other programs.
Among other advantages, Athlon64s have newer instruction sets, meaning that they will be compatible with more new software enhancements longer.
When it doesnt cost any more to get the Socket 939 Athlon64 processor, there is no reason to get a Socket A AthlonXP or a Socket 754 Athlon64, unless you already have a great Socket A or Socket 754 motherboard that just needs a CPU.
You can get a Socket 939 Athlon64 for less than the $160 you have indicated you might spend.
