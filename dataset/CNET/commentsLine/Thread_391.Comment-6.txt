the easiest way to find out is to install a program called belarc advisor and run it.
it will tell you everything about your computer and the system running on it.
find belarc advisor free here in cnet's dowload section.
if the puter itself is inoperable, then one must open it up and look at the board to find out what it is.
however, if your puter is still under warrenty, opening it yourself will void that warrenty!!!
contact the manufacturer, tell the make, model and serial number to see if they can tell you.
they should be able to do this for you.
hope this helps.
good luck!
