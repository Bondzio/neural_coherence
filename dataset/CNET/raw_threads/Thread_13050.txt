I have a decision to make soon, in fact before my grandson comes up for the summer. Right now I do alot of genealogy, some desk publishing (business cards and Brochures for my small business), manipulate photos with photoshop 5.5. I have a Toshiba Laptop 1805 and it does the job, except I have to hook up a cd burner whenever I want to cut a cd. I am set up wireless with a 5mb line from Charter Cable. The Toshiba is getting old, had to reload it twice since xmas, but I like XP because this is easy to do. Now for the problems: 1. I am a former main-frame programmer, who is frustrated by PC's and all the choices you have to make. 2. I kind of like to sit on my couch and multi-task while working on the internet. 3. My grandson is coming up for a few months, and since he can't bring his PS/3, he wants to play that WOW game here. QUESTION: Do I really need to get a desktop to satisfy both our needs? And which machine would you suggest? I talked to Dell because I used to have one, and like the onsite repair they offer. He recommended a laptop, something about XPS, or 1505 for about $1300 + and a desktop for a few hundred dollars less. I really hate to spend that much at this time, any ideas. My daughter in Texas bought a emachine at Comp USA for a few hundred dollars, and is going to add wireless card, new video card and more memory or RAM, since I am not that technically inclined and live in a small town in MI, I am not that adventurous . Appreciate any ideas or suggestions, JQ

A modern laptop has built-in all the features you, not your grandson, currently use and some models even exceed them. Gaming on a laptop is definitely possible but not for lower powered models. Generally, a gaming machine requires fast graphics which in turn consume more power and runs hotter and drain batteries faster when not on AC power. You could buy such a laptop for $1500-$2000 but you may be better off getting both a lower priced laptop for your use and a desktop for gaming. Go to a Best Buy or Circuit City or CompUSA and check the selections. Or get from Dell. The major brands generally have good support, in spite of occasional lapses. How about this: get a laptop now and when your grandson arrives, have him play his game to see if it's good enough; if not you can walk into the store and pick up a powerful enough desktop at a moment's notice. Have fun shopping!

They tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive. If all you Granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine. Reason why I say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer.
