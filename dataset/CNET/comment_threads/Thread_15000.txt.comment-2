http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=Gateway+GT5408+3+Beeps seems to point to memory issues.
In fact you did that and it did fix it for a short time which tells you it was that.
It is possible that the motherboard has developed a failure but it is still a memory or memory controller type failure.
--&gt; What confused me is how did you run memtest if it fails to boot and have no visual?
