as you have noticed, the connector on the 1705 is not a standard vga connector so the vga to vga idea will not work.
that connector is actually a da-15 but is often referred to as db-15.
the apple monitor cable is wider than vga and will need an adapter to bring it down in size.
there is an adapter, see it here that will work for you but you will need to buy an apple monitor cable to connect the monitor to the cable.
hope this helps p
