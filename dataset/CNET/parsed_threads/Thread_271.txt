<s> How do I match up an AMD processor with a compatible motherboard? </s>
<s> I know I have to match up the Series, such as Athlon or Sempron, socket type, and front side bus. </s>
<s> Anything else? </s>
<s> Also, I'm accustomed to Intel processors, but AMD processors always seem to either give two numbers when it comes to the front side bus or just one Hyper Transports number. </s>
<s> What numbers do I have to match up to make this work? </s>
<s> For Intel processors, their cores are named such as Allendale, Conroe, or Cedar Mill. </s>
<s> What do these names mean? </s>
<s> Also, why is there such a huge difference in price between an Intel Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Extreme? </s>
<s> Both have 4 cores and comparable ghz speeds. </s>
<s> if so, just get a motherboard based on am2/am2+ socket. </s>
<s> it will be compatible with all new am2 and am2+ processors. </s>
<s> this page should help you: http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPUFilter.aspx core2quad currently tops out at 2.66ghz q6700 (2.8ghz q9550 is due out soon) while core2extreme has 3ghz qx6850 (2x4mb L2 cache) and 3ghz qx9650 (12mb L2 cache). </s>
<s> the qx6700 is obsolete. </s>
