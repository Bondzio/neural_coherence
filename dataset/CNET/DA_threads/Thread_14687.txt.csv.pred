1.2.1	& quot ; According to the manual , the LED sequence indicates & quot ; Other Failure & quot ; and two beeps indicate & quot ; Memory Parity can not be reset & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	& quot ; This in short means the computer needs repair .	St
1.2.3	It does not indicate what part to replace but for most shops they replace the motherboard .	St
1.2.4	But that clue later in your post would have me swapping in another video card .	St
1.2.5	Try that first .	St
1.2.6	Yes you might be a home owner without spare parts .	St
1.2.7	This is why most of us take it to the shop for repairs or just replace the machine .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	From your description , this seems more like a graphic card problem .	St
1.3.2	If you have another PC or Laptop at home , try to connect the monitor to them and test it out .	St
1.3.3	If the monitor is working , then it 's probably the graphic card 's fault .	St
1.3.4	If you 're not technically trained , as Bob suggested , please visit a computer repair shop to get things fixed .	St
