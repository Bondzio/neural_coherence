My PC is as old as the broken monitor and I want to make sure the newer monitors out there are compatible with my display adapter card. I am interested in a Widescreen monitor, but when I open up the display settings for my PC the only choices I have are 800x600 and 1280x1024 since my broken monitor was in the 4:3 aspect ratio. My videocard is old...a nVidia 64MB GeForce 2 MMX or something like that. Would I be okay getting a widescreen monitor or do I have to stick with the 4:3 ones? Thanks.
