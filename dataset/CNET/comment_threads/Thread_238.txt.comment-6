i tried all those suggestions you mentioned ccleaners regedit defragmentation and uninstalling process.
It all worked out and i suffer no more from crashes and slow start up!
but when i was doing the regedit version, i was so nervous that i might delete a wrong file so before i started the regedit, i study first the apps/prgm i installed and uninstalled and then proceed to the deleting process and it went very well.
so when i boot my pc i smile because in less than a second after my windows start up my desktop shows and my system tray work faster now.
thankz guyz i luv this forum!
