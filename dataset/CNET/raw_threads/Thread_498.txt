When I put in the special photo ink cartidges, the print quality takes a nosedive. Suggestions? Thank you

Since I hadn't been getting good printing copies using the photo ink, I thought the cradle that came in the box might be something I was supposed to be using. That turned out to be a &quot;holder&quot; for the cartridge when it is not being used. Eventually, I was steered to a page which explained the correct combination of cartridges to use. 57 is the color cartridge, whether it be regular or photo. The other cartridge uses a 56 or 58. I had to make sure that I was using the 57 PHOTO and the 58 PHOTO GREY rather than just the black and white cartridge or the photo grey with just the color cartridge. Still, I don't see that using the photo ink makes a much better photo print than using regular ink. Still, perhaps the photo inks last longer.

I think that you may at some point in time want to try a better printer. I have had two Epson printers Epson Stylus C42 and now Epson Stylus C65. The life of the C42 expired and the C65 although I got some problems installing the same, it works really good. the reproduction is fantastic. I am happy with it, although I need to have a printer that would give me 18 b/w's per minute and 15 colour per minute. Having said this, you will not doubt understand that I will be going for an Epson. You will get quality for your money. I have tried HP and Canon. None compares. Visit Epson Website. Standeb.
