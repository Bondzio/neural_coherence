Here it is: I am using wireless connection at home (through a home router) and I have set my static IP (I do not obtain IP and DNS automatically - Internet protocol v4), so i can use port forwarding on my router. Everything is fine, i have set up my forwarding ports and it works ok. The problem is, when i connect to a different network, my computer will not connect, because with my settings i do not obtain IP and DNS automatically. i have to change the settings to automaticaly obtain IP and DNS, but then my configuration is gone - i have to type in again all of the settings for a static IP and DNS when i want to connect to my home router. Can I do something to meke this easier (so i don't have to type all of the settings again and again etc... If i made any kind of mistake, please don't blame me - i am new to this. Thank you for your help and best regards, klemen

I can set up alternate config, but then my IP is not the one I want to have - i think my router makes the choice. I am using port forwarding for uTorrent. Best regards, klemen

Then with alternate config set up on wireless on the laptop, when you're at home it will try to obtain an IP first, then it will fall back to the IP and DNS you set up. When away from home, it will obtain IP with the 1st config. The downside to this is, any other computers used in your home must also be set up with static IP.

I tried setting up DHCP lease in router config for my computer (i just entered MAC adress of my computer and desired IP) and i think it is working - the router sets the desired IP on the specific MAC adress. Do you think this is ok? Thanks, regards klemen
