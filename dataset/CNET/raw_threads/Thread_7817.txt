I have boxes of documents that I would like to be able to access digitally rather than working my way throgh each box when I'm looking for something with a particular subject. Whenever I'm considering buying a new piece of computer equipment I always look in forums such as this which is why I am asking the question, &quot;What scanner that will accept multipages with an automatic feeder would be recomended? Obviousy I need software that will allow me to archive the documents in a way that will allow easy access. I did see Kodak ScanMate i920 ion &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; and I wonder if that would fit my needs.

Proffitt	2/28/12 8:12 AM	1.33041672E12	Clarification request: I own a Canon ms870 BUT	Many folk are used to copiers that they used at work that handle just about anything we throw into the hopper. THESE ARE NOTHING LIKE THOSE THINGS. While it does work, the word I'm going to use here is &quot;fiddly.&quot; ALL the consumer grade units are affordable but you tend to have to work with the menus, feed it content without any big wrinkles. Most folk will end the first day very mad and will not be a person you'd invite to the party. Bob
