I have a zoom modem that works fine with my desktop pc. When I hook it into my IBM Thinkpad T23 laptop, the browser will not display any web pages. I get the page not found error. I have installed the driver for the built in ethernet and the device manager says it is working properly. There are 2 leds on the ethernet port. One shows green and the other orange. When I type IPCONFIG into the cmd box, It reports 0.0.0.0 for IP address and Subnet Mask. I do not really know what this stuff means, but I do know that I cannot connect. Any help would be appreciated.
