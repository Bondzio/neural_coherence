1.1.2	Any known issues with the slimline models ?	Ques
1.1.3	It appears you ca n't add a second HD ( I can live with that ) .	St
1.2.1	more adaptable/up gradable .	St
1.2.2	Narrow form factor for expansion cards can limit your options .	St
1.2.3	That 's my two cents worth .	St

1.3.1	just do n't expect to play any games like doom 3 or fear on it .	St
1.3.2	also , i would shop around for a model with DVI ( or HDMI ) output so you can hook it up to high-def monitor/tv easily .	St
1.4.1	Do n't need the hi-def , so so far it sounds ok	St

1.5.2	I upgraded the graphics card to nvidia 8400 GS .	St
1.5.3	I can play Call of Duty 4 with no probs even with the resolution set at higest .	St
1.5.4	I also got the HP pocket drive .	St
1.5.5	This machine was worth the bang for the buck .	St
1.5.6	I am not a serious gamer but more or less both gamer and work user on the comp .	St
1.5.7	I like it !	St
1.6.1	the system has 400 GB hard drive , 2048 MB ram 64 x 2 AMD with wireless and TV tuner ... HD ready as well .	St
1.7.1	Generally ... .I do n't like slim lines : minimal heat dissipation , low capacity PSUs , limited expandability for additional drives ( no drive free/open drive bays ) and limited slots and choices for peripherals .	St
1.7.2	.	St
1.7.3	.	St
1.7.4	esp .	St
1.7.5	GPUs ( because of slim/low profile case ) .	St

1.8.1	You used a nvidia 8400 GS low profile and it worked in this pc .	St
1.8.2	i am having a difficult time finding a decent graphics card that will let me play all the the new stuff .	St
1.8.3	any suggestions ?	Ques
1.8.4	where did you grt yours ?	Ques
1.9.1	When you installed this card did u also upgrade the power supply , I understand it 's only a 160w supply .	St
1.9.2	What kind of power does your graphics card draw ?	Ques
1.9.3	I would like to upgrade my s3220n card but am fearful about this .	St
1.10.1	I have nothing against low-profile PCs ; many people like the much smaller footprint .	St
1.10.2	But , you need to be aware that your video card upgrade options are more limited because you need a low-profile card .	St
1.10.3	That said , I think the Intel Core 2 Duo version - s3200t - offers more flexibility in configuration than the AMD version .	St
1.10.4	You can configure one starting at about $ 450 .	St
1.10.5	BTW : I own an HP Media Center PC and it 's the best designed and most reliable PC I 've ever owned .	St
1.10.6	In my experience , HP is a good choice for PCs .	St
1.11.1	I also installed a video card on the s3220n .	St
1.11.2	I got the EVGA 8400GS .	St
1.11.3	It was a standard video card but I unscrewed the bracket , took the VGA port from it and used a low profile bracket instead .	St
1.11.4	I am not using the TV Tuner though , so I took it from the PC since it would allow more room for the video card .	St
1.11.5	( Video card 's fan was too close to the TV Tuner ) So far I havent had any problems .	St
1.11.6	Been playing COD4 , Gears of Wars and Bioshock without any problems .	St
