hi all.
i hope someone can help me out here, i've been scratching my head over this for two months now.
i bought a gigabyte 6600gt silentpipe because a) it's quiet and b) it has vivo.
when i fit it into my machine (spec below)with an epox 8hda3+ mobo, it will not even post.
the lights come on, the fans spin, but no action.
if i try it in my other machine which has an abit nf7s2 board, all is well.
if i put the xfx6800le out of the abit system into the epox, all is well.
this is the way things are at the moment, although i would like the gigabyte in the more powerful system as i have a lot of old videos that i want to convert.
if anyone can offer any pointers or a solution, i will be most grateful.
thanks for looking.
system: epox 8hda3+ motherboard.
amd64 3000+ processor 1 gig of no-name ram hiperpower type r 480 watt psu 200 gig seagate barracuda sata x2 nec 3250 dvd-rw xfx 6800le (all pipes and shaders open, bless you rivatune)
