&quot;terabytes of data don't transfer quickly on a 100mb network.&quot; there is really no need to transfer such quickly.
what matters is that whatever you do, it should withstand and be able to help you recover from the disaster you plan for.
that is, if your building goes down in flames, is whisked away by hurricane or is submerged by flood whatever you do withstands those disasters.
many forget the disaster plan.
this means that at some point you have to consider off site storage of what you can't lose.
