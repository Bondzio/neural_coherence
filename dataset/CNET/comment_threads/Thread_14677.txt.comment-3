Read the label on the PSU (power supply) and find it's WATTS rating.
Now go get something about 100 Watts bigger than that.
There is no reason to skimp here since the PC innards will draw what they need and your PSU will loaf along, not work too hard and last longer than if you picked out the exact size by measuring the Watts needed by the system.
I use those 20 buck 600++ Watt PSUs at the office but some like the brand names.
