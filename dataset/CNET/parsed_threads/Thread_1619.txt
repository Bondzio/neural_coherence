<s> Just a general question, I'm a n00b and so I ask. </s>
<s> My PC has 6GB RAM 1333 MhZ Full Specs [IMG] http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/fullspecs.png [/IMG] Now as I check in CPU-Z and speccy, I see that my RAM is utilized at a max of 540MhZ. </s>
<s> What I need to know is, when I have 1333MhZ Memory DIMMs, then why is it not utilizing to its full capacity. </s>
<s> Or is it that 533MhZ is the actual speed and the 1333MhZ speed is what I can get only by OC'ing????? </s>
<s> [IMG] http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb228/Jaxx89/FullRAMusage.png [/IMG] Please let me know. </s>
<s> That 1333 isn't really mhz clock speed. </s>
<s> That will depend on many factors including your CPU clock speed. </s>
<s> As well, DDR RAM is supposed to transfer twice the data of non DDR at the same clock speed...or something like that. </s>
<s> Here's more on the numbers game. </s>
<s> The RAM cited here is a bit dated but you can get a better idea of what the numbers might mean. </s>
<s> As long as you use identical RAM in all 6 slots, you shouldn't experience performance drops. </s>
