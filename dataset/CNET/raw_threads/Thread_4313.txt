I also use Norton, AdAware SE, Spybot, C-Cleaner and Windows Defender. I run regular Defrags and regular Internet history and temp files deletions. YET my compuet is getting slower, especially when on the internet. Is there anything that anyone can suggest?

Also as updates come out Microsoft's patches seem to go slower and slower since it's not a priority OS for them. You also have Norton... I'd uninstall any software you haven't run in a year to start with. Bob
