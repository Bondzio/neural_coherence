Im making a computer for the first time.
Im doing this partially to get to know the inside of the computer, partially to start a new hobby and partially cause i need a new computer.
my budget is pretty low cause im pretty young and cause i dont need it to be extremely high end.
just looking for advice on what i can do to have it run at an average load and small computer games (mainly World of warcraft on low graphics if i decide that i want to go back to that).
the link to my plans are https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1bmBxNbkaSkUHAOm62OVIH4SQyGlTEUDb4-zCrN6_6ns&authkey=CJDijwg&hl=en# .
any help is appreciated.
