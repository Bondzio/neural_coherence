i had been using dhcp, but i checked and it had not put in the settings correctly.
i then stopped using dhcp; i put in the settings without it.
i did get an ip address i used wep 128-bit security i tried to install the network on the main computer and it said, &quot;the wizard cannot create a wireles network, either because a wireless network adapter is not installed or because software for the wireless network adapter is not installed.&quot; i just installed it, but i didn't get a choice on what channel to use, and it chose the wrong one (it picked 6, my other computer is using 11) how do i change that?
