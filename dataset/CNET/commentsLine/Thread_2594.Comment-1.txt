i need to get a new computer, but i'm only a basic user.
i read the intel is 30% faster than the amd.
is this true?
and would someone like me notice the diffference??
how is amd???
i can get an hp pavillion with the amd 1.86 ghz and 1gb memory (2 x512 sticks) with a 250gb hard drive for $799.99, or should i invest in the intel processor at 2.13 ghz w/2 gb memory (2 x 1024 mb sticks) for $1299.99??
i want something that's gonna last a few years without needing updating.
