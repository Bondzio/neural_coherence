1.1.1	Ok , I just got a Radeon X1900XTX .	St
1.1.2	I noticed it came with a composite as well as an S-Video cable ... does this mean I could plug this into my PC and then plug my Playstation 2 into it and play console games on my PC monitor ?	Ques
1.2.1	You supplied a chip make/number but not the make/model of the video card so I ca n't tell if it has video IN which would make this possible .	St
1.2.2	Some see the cable and think aha , this should work but do n't think about the INs and Outs .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	oops..haha sorry .	Polite
1.3.2	It 's video IN If it DOES allow me to plug a playstation 2 into it ( it does , I tried , but not sure if that 's what it 's meant for ) How would I go about having it display on screen ?	Ques
1.3.3	I dont ' see any kind of option for that .	St
1.4.1	Oh and not sure on the make model .	St
1.4.2	It has the name on the box and it says Avivo and a few other things .	St
1.4.3	It 's PCI Express ATI official brand if that helps	St
1.5.1	http : //www.ati.com/technology/avivo/index.html shows avivo is some nice marketing fluff .	St
1.5.2	You might be able to just connect your video out from the PS2 to the video in , run up the supplied software to see if this works .	St
1.5.3	Sorry but with specific model numbers ( even better a link to the card ) I can only write generalities .	St
