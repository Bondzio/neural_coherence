I have Windows XP on my pc.
My question is: Can I redo a hard drive, it has already been formatted and partitioned once, but at the time I wasn;t sure of how to turn a 40gig drive into 2 20gigs.
I ended up with four partitions on a 40gig.
three of those four are WAY too small, so I wanted to know if there is any way to go back and strart from the beginning again, without causing a HUGE headache.
Thanks!
(I would like to make it only two partitions instead of four.)
