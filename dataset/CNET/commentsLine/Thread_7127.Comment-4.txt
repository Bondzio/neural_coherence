i have a new post here on correct psu install for both of my systems that have the exact same problem.
this emachine & my hp a6437c.

i almost believe both my systems have bad mobo's.

that's a real bummer.
couldn't have been a cheaper componant go bad with my income.
a friend at work guided me to a free section on craigslist i did not even know about that.
