and low wattage PSU.
Your system has a built-in graphics CPU (vice a graphics card) and the memory to run it is borrowed from the system memory.
You're OK re RAM but onboard video doesn't cut it for games.
Adding a more powerful video card, one suitable for gaming, takes a more robust PSU.
You could look for a video card that doesn't require more than a 300 WATT PSU but that will really limit your options.
Good Luck and keep us posted.
