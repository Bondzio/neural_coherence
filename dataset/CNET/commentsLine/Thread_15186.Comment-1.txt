i don't have any kind of technical background with computers, so your help is greatly appreciated.
i am getting into video editing and just got powerdirector 9. our current laptops could run it, but i would rather use a beefier machine that can handle it with ease.
in addition to that, the computer would mostly be used for simple internet browsing and microsoft office 2010/beyond.
we would like to store all of our photos on there as well.
without any true computing knowledge, i do not know how much computer i really need.
i would like to keep the total package under $1,000.
any guidance, assistance, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
i can post additional information if it is needed.
thank you!
