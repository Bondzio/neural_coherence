7500	5	564973	5320218	5320130	zioup2	6/7/12 11:20 pm	1.3391112e12	no i understand...	it's because i'm not very good with admin, iptable.... that's why at first i want url adress... both is ok. thank you somebody tell me that :rb951-2n of mikrotik.... do you know?
7500	6	564973	5320219	5320098	zioup2	6/7/12 11:30 pm	1.3391118e12	ok, thank you	thank you but with dd-wrt, tomato, openwrt, it's not possible without extensive work on the configuration. no, the router has to say in whitelist allow &quot; allow &quot; allow &quot; allow &quot; allow &quot; allow &quot; and block all other url in the world you says &quot; but there are new routers every day so maybe someone has seen one &quot; yes it is that's why i ask to all wireless forum i can find. somebody speaks me about mikrotik... i have to try. thank you.
