hi i have a pc with the following spec: windows vista home premium 32-bit intel g33m motherboard 500-watts ps intel core 2 duo e6550 @ 2.33ghz 2 x 1gb patriot pc-6400 ram @ 800mhz geforce 8800gt oc wd 500gb hard i know that he maximum supported ram is 8gb on my pc, i currently have 2 gb in dual channel and i notice vista is a bit slow on startup.
will i see a performance increase if i upgrade to 3gb?
what if i upgrade my ram to 8gb by adding 2 more 2gb ram sticks?
will having unused ram decrease my pc performance?
thanks
