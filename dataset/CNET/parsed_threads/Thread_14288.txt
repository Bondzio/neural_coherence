<s> I am looking to collect some ideas before plopping down a large amount of money for a machine that can keep up with my graphics work. </s>
<s> I work in publishing and I use applications like Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator often. </s>
<s> I find that I need to run at least two of these applications simultaneously along with the standard Outlook and Internet Explorer. </s>
<s> At times, my system slows to a crawl (P4 2.8, 768MB RAM, 128 NVidia Ti4200, 50GB HD). </s>
<s> What suggestions would you make to help me modify this? </s>
<s> I have tinkered with the idea of dual processors but then there is the P4 Extreme Edition. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> Next year you will see DUAL-CORE CPUs that will make you cry you paid so dearly for a DUAL-CPU motherboard based solution. </s>
<s> As to your machine crawling, the only time I see this is if the user leaves programs running they are not using. </s>
<s> Also, INTERNET EXPLOERER is a great way to let parasites on the machine and again the complaints are similar to yours. </s>
<s> Post if you dare a hijackthis log and let's see if your machine has parasites. </s>
<s> I will not do much other than note if I see them. </s>

<s> I also use similar graphic applications and run them simultaneously. </s>
<s> To run those applications simultaneously, you need: a professional graphic card the like nvidia quadro nvs280 or fx500 or ati firegl (128 NVidia Ti4200 is maily design for 3d game applications), and 2 or 3 identical harddisks in raid 0 or raid 5 configuration, (for speedy data transfer between data processing and storage subsystem, as these graphic application uses a large tempfile and stored it in harddisk as scratchdisk. </s>
<s> eg. </s>
<s> while composing an A0-size poster in photoshop, the tempfile can be blotted to more than 1 gb, and you need to partition your hd into several drives around 20-40gb each), and 1536 MB RAM is the minimun. </s>
<s> A dual Opteron system with some 10,000 rpm hard drives would be nice. </s>
