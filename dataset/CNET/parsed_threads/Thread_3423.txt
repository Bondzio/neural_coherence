<s> I have Dell Laptop with vista . </s>
<s> when I search for wireless network it shows my network with &quot;Excellent&quot; signal, but when I connect to the network it decrases to &quot;good&quot; or sometimes &quot;low&quot; . </s>
<s> the router is in a very close distance with the laptop . </s>
<s> When I tried another laptop, it shows an &quot;Excellent&quot; signal and even when I connect to the network it gives me &quot;Excellent&quot; signal. </s>
<s> So , why My Dell give me a &quot;low&quot; signal only when it is connected ? </s>
<s> thanks . </s>
<s> But the network speed was 54 megabit so there was no issue to fix. </s>
<s> -&gt; You might ask why and the answer is the driver has a bug. </s>
