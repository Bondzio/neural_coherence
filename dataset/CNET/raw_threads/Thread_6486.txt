One day, The DVD-R/CD-R Drive started to act up. It decided to not reconize any CDs and instead just let it spin and for some reason, it still would reconize DVDs. So alright, DVDs work fine, no problem, I can live with that. But just about a week ago, it started giving me problems with DVD-Rs. It will read the thing, but I won't be able to burn anything. I took it down to the shop and the guys took a look at it and he reinstalled the burning software. No luck. It's a new computer, I got it in May. Please help.

Since the thing was custom built by the company (Clear Image Computers) The whole computer came with a 3 year warranty. They will replace any damaged parts, inspect it, and upgrade it (Providing that you will pay for the parts) For free.
