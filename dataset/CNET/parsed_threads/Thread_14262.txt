<s> I have two hard drives, one floppy drive, one cd rom drive and one cd/rw drive. </s>
<s> Is it possible to hook up a zip drive using a 3 device ribbon cable. </s>
<s> I would like to put it on the same ribbon cable as the two cd roms I have now. </s>
<s> The zip drive was given to me and works fine. </s>
<s> I just do not want to loose a cd rom or hard drive in order to hook it up. </s>
<s> Sorry, only two. </s>
<s> My workaround has been to add an external USB case. </s>

<s> The Zip Drive is an internal drive. </s>
<s> I really would like to keep it that way. </s>
<s> This is why I wanted to use a 3 device IDE 40 pin ribbon cable and hook it up in line with my cd rom's </s>
<s> But remember these issues: 1. </s>
<s> IDE ports support two devices. </s>
<s> You can cable up more, but it won't work. </s>
<s> Having dealt with those that insist, I have such a cable handy so they can try it themselves. </s>
<s> About 1/2 are angry it doesn't work. </s>
<s> The other 1/2 seem to like trying. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> IDE PCI cards may not support CD, CDRW, DVD or ZIP drives so be sure your selected IDE card supports what you are going to plug into it. </s>
