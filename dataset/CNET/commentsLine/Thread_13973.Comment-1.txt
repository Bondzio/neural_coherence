so i have a dell computer and a lcd acer monitor.
i was useing a dvi-d cable but switched out computers.
now i have the dell and im useing a vga cable but it says i have no signal.
i most likely need to change the input to vga but i dont know how.
the few buttons that are on my monitor dont do anything cuz i have no signal.
any suggestions
