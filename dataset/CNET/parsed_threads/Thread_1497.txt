<s> I would like some advice on what keyboard I should get for my system. </s>
<s> I am using a 60&quot; T.V. </s>
<s> as the display for my computer, so I need to be far enough away from the screen to enjoy it. </s>
<s> It is in the basement living room, about 15' from the couch. </s>
<s> I want a quality wireless keyboard that won't make me bankrupt, my current wireless keyboard does not work at the range. </s>
<s> One feature I would be interested in is any kind of illumination, glow in the dark, backlight, whatever. </s>
<s> If it is a gaming keyboard, that would be just fine, as long as it does not cost a fortune. </s>
<s> A gaming keyboard is not necessary, but preferable. </s>
<s> I have looked at IOGEAR, and they have a keyboard with a 33' range, I just don't know how well it would work, and I don't need the mouse that comes with it, I have a Logitech G7 mouse. </s>
<s> Logitech has some really nice wired gaming keyboards, (The G19 and the G15 are too expensive, but the G11 might work) I just don't know how long their cords are. </s>
<s> Their wireless K350 looks really nice, but I need to know if its range is good enough. </s>
<s> Priorities: 1 - Works well long range, quality. </s>
<s> 2 - Some kind of illumination. </s>
<s> 3 - Gaming grade </s>
<s> For range, Bluetooth, range 25 to 30 feet. </s>
<s> Check spec on your unit to see if Bluetooth is an option. </s>
<s> Hello! </s>
<s> I'm with DSI and we carry some keyboards that you would probably be interested in taking a look at. </s>
