I am having big problem with Dell A920 all-in-one printer/scanner/copier.
Before I installed it, I had Adobe Pro 6.0 installed (which turns docs into PDFs) and an HP Deskjet Now, after installing the A920, my Adobe print/make PDF function has disappeared and my HP Deskjet (both say &quot;no printers installed&quot; when try to use them) Seems the A920 has taken over/conflict??
Then when I try to uninstall and reinstall Adobe Pro it says &quot;Error 1920 Service Print Spooler (Spooler) failed to start.
Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services&quot;.
Which is ridiculous - I am the administrator of the computer/only account.
I have never in twenty years had one device wreak such havoc on my system!
Can anyone help?
Can;'t find anything in the Dell knowledge base!
Thanks PS Running Windows XP SP2
