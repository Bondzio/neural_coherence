1.1.2	The DELL Ultrasharp U2711 has very good stats , features and reviews , but it is more than 2 years old , and I find very little info on anything to replace it .	St
1.1.3	IS there anything out there in the same general price range , with equal or better qualities and features ?	Ques
1.1.4	I know it is supposed to run & quot ; hot & quot ; , but other than that ( and the fact that it is a two-year-old design ) ... .would it be a poor choice for a new purchase ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , jp	St

1.3.1	Well , I have been using an ancient , huge , Viewsonic CRT , which I have always liked , but which is beginning to SHOW it 's age .	St
1.3.2	I like BIG , and I want GOOD ... trouble is , I have n't shopped in so long , I have lost the & quot ; thread & quot ; on what to look for .	St
1.3.3	I would say 80 % of my useage is managing images , and text documents , some photoshop work , and the rest in online games like WOW , SWTOR , and Second Life .	St

1.5.1	are disproportionately priced , it might be worthwhile to consider dual displays ... like two 23 & quot ; or 24 & quot ; equivalents .	St
1.5.2	I see great offers for monitors including Dells on Techbargains.com ... .look right at the top of the webpage under 'Top Deals by Product Category ' .	St
1.5.3	You 'd probably spend the around the same amount but you 'd have two displays ... more screen space and options if that would be any benefit to you .	St
1.5.4	Let us know .	St
