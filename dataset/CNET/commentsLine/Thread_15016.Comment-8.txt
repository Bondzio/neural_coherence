we've had the isp (bt) look into the problem.
they did multiple line checks and swapped our hardware and came to the conclusion that the connection between us and the exchange is working fine.
the logs don't register any drops of service and running a ping test i could ping over 5000 packet with 0% loss (i stopped the test manually at 5000, it would have carried on doing more without fault i think).
the problem only manifests when we are using our browsers and get timeouts that can take several attempts to clear up and deliver the pages.
