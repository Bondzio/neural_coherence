<s> Hi: Two weeks ago my ZIP 100 disk died a sudden death. </s>
<s> I use an external ZIP 100 drive on my Dell laptop. </s>
<s> I used ZIP storeage on my older computer so when I got this computer six months ago I bought a new Iomega ZIP 100 disk drive. </s>
<s> The disk is bad, not the drive. </s>
<s> I put other ZIP disks in to the drive and it works well on those ZIP disks. </s>
<s> I saved all of my data since a year ago on this disk. </s>
<s> I mean ALL of my data. </s>
<s> I saved to that ZIP drive instead of my hard drive. </s>
<s> I lost all of it That is the simplest way to put it. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me by giving me suggestions on how to recover the data on this disk? </s>
<s> I took it to two computer shops near where I live and both said the disk is toast. </s>
<s> Also, what would have caused the disk to crash like that? </s>
<s> Could a cell phone near it do it when the phone rings? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> I have to wonder if your original ZIP drive pertains here. </s>
<s> http://kb.iu.edu/data/ahhd.html This is old news and resulted in a class action law suit a while back. </s>
<s> The suggestions is the drives themselves were destroying the disks making the date unrecoverable. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=zip+data+recovery finds recovery houses. </s>

<s> How did you save every byte of your data on a single Zip disk? </s>
<s> 100 MB isn't much. </s>
<s> If you go down to &quot;what I can't lose&quot; it gets to be very small. </s>
<s> When the Tsunami is coming in, it's all the data I'll need to save. </s>
