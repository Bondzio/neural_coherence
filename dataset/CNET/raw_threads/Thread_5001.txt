I have recently ran across a problem with it. I travel for work so I bought it for obvious reasons. Anyway, I have a few work programs that require a 1024 x 768 resolution and one that requires 1280 resolution. However as most netbooks currently run on 1024 x 600 I cant run these programs. DOes anyone know of any programs or ways to override this requirement? I know that with these programs there is little need to have the resolution requirement but thats the way it is. If I have to scroll left right fine, but to not even be able to open them is not fun at all. Kinda defeats the purpose of the netbook. Thanks

But here's how I enable 1024x768 or larger on my netbook. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZFRSviqQGE0/SkaB-zAE3ZI/AAAAAAAAARU/3PO61NhEs4I/s1600-h/gma_945_control.JPG Then the display is 1024x768, the screen size remains the same and the screen PANS or SCROLLS as your mouse hits the edges. This has been supported since Windows 95 days but as there is no standard to enable it I often find myself fishing for the settings when I get a new machine. I have the Acer you have something else so I can't be specific except to tell you this is a non-problem. Bob

Here's more links. http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/archive/index.php/t-53236.html And I did NOT have to download coolbits or ANYTHING else. This feature is in there but many forgot about it. Bob

Go to the advanced graphics settings (Control Panel|Display|Advanced) and click on the Monitor tab. Uncheck the option to &quot;Hide display types the monitor cannot display&quot; and then you can set your display to most any resolution you like. Of course, the actual screen resolution doesn't change, but you get a virtual desktop the size of the setting you choose and software that requires 1024x768 or whatever, will work. The virtual desktop automatically scrolls when you move the mouse to the edge of the screen. Good luck!

It lifts all restrictions on the desktop size and your windows sizes. Very handy for netbooks and other small screen computers. It works like pan and scan but better because your desktop icons and taskbar stay always at the the same place. Has also heaps of other powerfull options. Works very well for me. Nick.

You can't have more than that. However, what you could do is, use teamviewer to connect to any other pc through your netbook and work normally. condition is the your internet speed should be good enough.
