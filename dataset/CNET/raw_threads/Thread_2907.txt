(One computer acts as a server, and three other computers are workstations.) We've been able to map the drive to the server from the workstations. However, we can't seem to execute a program because the program, according a pop-up dialogue box, &quot;cannot run via a UNC filename.&quot; The question: How do I map a drive from the workstation to the server without using a UNC filename. I followed as close as possible the mapping procedures we used in Windows XP. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.
