it will want to print to a port.
The default is usually LPT1.
You should get a message asking if it's a local or network printer.
You select network printer and follow the instructions to browse to a shared printer or create a port.
You will be creating a TCP/IP port that &quot;points&quot; to the printer.
It will be the printer's wireless IP address.
Hope that explains better.
