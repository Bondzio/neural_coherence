My PC would not recognize my monitor.
I tried another monitor but nothing.
I plugged my monitor into another connector on back of the PC and now the monitor works but I keep getting an error message after restart: &quot;The ATI Control Panel failed to initialize because no ATI driver is installed or ATI driver not working properly.&quot; What is causing this?
Is there is special connector on back of PC for monitors only?
Can I install/buy a new connector?
If so, where do I purchase them?
