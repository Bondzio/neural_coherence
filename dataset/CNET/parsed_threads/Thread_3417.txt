<s> Hello,I hope you guys can give me a great answer, Iv'e read blogs until I'm blue in the face,,so many different things,,I have Win 7 Prem 64 bit,i7 950 3.07 ghz. </s>
<s> ,6 gigs of 12800/1600 Ram,Asus Sabertooth X58 Motherboard 1366,Nvidia GTS 450,1 Tarabyte WD Black,1000 Watt Antec PSU,CoolerMaster Storm Sniper Case,CPU-Z shows that I have 6 gigs of Ram but Windows 7 and Bios don't,I've swapped the Ram sticks and still no difference,I can't see it being a bad ram stick after swapping the all work,and CPU-Z sees all of them ,or a CPU fan being to tight or a bent pin on CPU,my next step im considering is to update the Bios,although I don't like doing that,,or to up the voltages of my Ram,Ram specs. </s>
<s> 1.65 volts,Bios says there running at 1.5 volts right now,I hate to have to mess with the voltages could be dangerous,Intel advises not to go above 1.65 volts it could damage processer and or chipset,I know .15 volts don't seem like much but,,any Help would be Great ! </s>
<s> !Not sure if I'm barking up the right tree or not any ideas ? </s>
