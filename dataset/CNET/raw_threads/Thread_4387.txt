The iPad is less likely to lag and is easier to use but limits the apps you can get. Personally, I prefer the iPad.

But for iPad level ( hardware/price point ) MS has spent a decade proving it can't do a good job in that arena. Maybe when Win 8 has been out for a while, but not now. As for iPad, given the hardware you will be overpaying. What's the matter with Android?

Chances are, you will get far more mileage with the iPad 3 then Windows Tablet. W-Tab is yet to be released, the app selection will be tiny compared to iOS or Android. Android also suffers from consistent support. Most Android tables do not have easy OS upgrades, and incomplete hardware support. There are very good reasons why iPad dominates tablets, will over 60% of tablet sales. An iPad 1 can be updated to the latest iOS 5.1.1 (and like iOS 6). Of course iPad has limits, so consider that when you look at when you decide. Bottom line: wait a few months on how successful the Windows tab is before you decide to spend your money.

Yeah yeah, the people that buy the unuderpowered equipment all say specs don't matter, but I see the car commercials which talk about acceleration, mpg, cyuclinders etc. Seems that put in the proper perspective specs do matter.

Windows 8 is the simply amazing. Win 8 tablets can do everything that ipad does but ipad cannot do everything that win 8 does.
