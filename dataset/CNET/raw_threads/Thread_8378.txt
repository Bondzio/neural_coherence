Its about one and a half yrs old, and was working smoothly. One fine day suddenly when i inserted the USB cable in my Laptop, it could not be accessed at all. The laptop can detect it, as i can see the USB icon in the system tray, but the drive is not seen in My Computer and neither does it autorun. I have loads of data stored in it and i do not have a back up! I do not understand wht is happening and wht must be done to recover the data. I have tried using the recovery softwares, but the softwares too cannot do anything, as the drive is not being accessed by them too... Please help!
