My roomate just had to go to three months of inpatient rehab cuz hes dumb and now Im worried about some of his friends breaking into my house. My pride and joy is my collection of playstation 1 and 2 games that Ive spent years and lots of cash to get, I have hundreds of them and most of them sell for 50-175 on ebay. Ive recently put them in my storage building so I dont worry about them getting stolen but now Im worried about the 95+ degree weather weve been having ruining them. Is this a valid concern or are they fine in a hot storage building? If not any recommendations to store and keep them safe from theft? They will need to sit in there for at least 2 more months. thanks in advance for your help, the main thing Id like to know is if storing them in heat will harm them in any way

I like to collect games and systems like people cllect sports memorabilia. I also have sega and nintendo games and systems Id like to store, do you think the foil thing will work for all that as well?

It will stick with that and wont come out. Are you really serious in this? http://www.gpriceshop.com/blog
