here's what i was thinking of getting...(all newegg btw) case: rosewill r114a case w/ 400 wt psu; $57 motherboard: intel 915p; $112 cpu: p4 3.2 ghz prescott core; $222 ram: 512mb corsair xms ddr-500 $139 sound card: audigy 2 zs gamer limited $120 cd drive: dvd-rw w/ dual layer $110 video card: was thinking 6800gt but also maybe pci-express x-16 x800 pro $430 monitor: nec 19&quot; crt $214 os: xp pro sp2 $146 hd: seagate sata 160gb 7200rpm $129 what i'm looking for is a system that can be upgradable as far as ram goes but pretty nicely set as far as gaming an general multimedia goes for the next 2-3 years or so.
i'm coming off of a p3 733mhz, 128ram, 32mb tnt2 m64, sb sound, 30gb hd, and win me so obviously this is going to be a jump in performance.
i'm trying to balence mid high end performance on a moderately tight budget right now.
thoughts on what i'm looking into?
missing components?
keyboard adn mouse obvious exclusions.
i just looked a bit at amd compatible boards and noticed that they only support up to ddr 400, is that a bottleneck or can they get away with the lower supported speeds?
also i thought i remembered somewhere reading about someone using a hd as ram.
is that possible or is my memory faulty?
