are you using a flat panel monitor or a crt monitor?
do you happen to be using a heater, flourescent light or some other electrical appliance right next to your monitor (or computer).
that can cause problems similar to what you describe as well.
the problem only occurs when you have that device on.
if you have a crt the refresh rate should be set to at least 72hz or you do get flicker, which may be what you mean by jittery.
you do this in advanced settings.
the thing to try is a different monitor or your monitor on a different system to try and narrow down the cause.
