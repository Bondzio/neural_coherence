I'm on DSL with Bell South. I use the notebook most of the time in the living room area; the DSL modem and a Lynksys router which provides the wireless signal to the notebook is connected to another Dell computer; a desktop computer set up in a bedroom in the back of the house. I'm on Bell South DSL Lite and during the day the speed on the notebook ranges from 36.0 to 54.0 Mbps with a signal reading of good to excellent. Last night while in the living room the speed drop to 11.0 Mbps; then came up to 21Mbps; 36Mbps and finally reached 48.0Mbps. This signal change took place while I used the notebook in the living room. Could I have a defective Lynksys router? If not is such a signal flucuation normal? Big Steve Biloxi, Mississippi 01/28/07

Maybe it's time to reload the machine from scratch, install all the heavy protection, avoid P2P or any crack software and see if the machine stabilizes. A recurring theme are nearby neighbors with wifi. Just a few days ago I helped a neighbor change RF channels. And that's all it took. Bob

I'm not asking for recommendations on how best to go about fixing a grilled cheese sandwich on toasted honey wheat bread now am I. Big Steve Biloxi, Mississippi 01/28/07

Well then if you would take a walk over to the &quot;Communications and Messaging&quot; forum and check out my post in that forum and by all means be blunt. Big Steve Biloxi, Mississippi 01/29/07
