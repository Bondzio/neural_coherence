<s> Hey there, I've had this computer for only 3 years and it's badly outdated. </s>
<s> I'm wondering how much this computer would go up for (it's value) currently. </s>
<s> The computer's specification: Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 2.40GHz - L2 cache: 256kb Asrock Motherboard: P4i45GV R5.0 Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller Video Card 256MB RAM 16x CD/RW + DVD (not-DVD RW) Windows XP If there is anything I've missed please state so, thank you. </s>
<s> Try from 49 bucks if the restore CDs are missing to 149 all working. </s>
<s> Hey there, Thanks for your reply, I still have the full CDs which came with this computer on a side note. </s>
<s> My fault for not stating so. </s>
<s> IMHO, I'll downgrade the value to $100-125. </s>
<s> Actually the XP OS cd if not OEM from the likes of Gateway, Dell, etc., maybe the full value of the system more than anything else. </s>
<s> Restore/recovery disks must be the actual disks shipped with system. </s>
<s> In other words, if the XP CD is a &quot;retail version&quot; it has value. </s>
<s> Your Asrock mtrbd., as well as the low amount of ram and Celeron cpu is on the low-end. </s>
<s> More than anything else, the buyer would be advised not to buy from a knowledgeable person, considering what maybe required to get into a higher level, etc.. A basic system from eMachine while more expensive starts out offering much more and just as important, support. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
