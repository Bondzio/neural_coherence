before receiving help and support from microsoft, i am promped to enter my product id #.
i have a valid oem copy of vista home premium but microsoft says that my product id # is not valid.
my copy of vista was installed by hewlett packard on one of their new machines.
my computer lists the os product id # and says that this copy of vista is activated.
i have registered my computer through hp but no one there, that i have spoken to regarding this, seems to have even a clue of what i am talking about.
as a for instance, i ask; &quot;how do i get microsoft to recognize that my copy of vista home premium is valid?&quot; they answer; &quot;it is.&quot; when i try to explain and ask for an answer, i am put on hold, and/or transferred, and/or disconnected.
so, i thought that i'd ask you folks.
can anyone help?
