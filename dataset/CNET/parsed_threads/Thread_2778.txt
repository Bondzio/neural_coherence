<s> I need to take a HDD out of a HP Pavilion machine to use in another machine? </s>
<s> I opened the side panel & unscrewed the screw. </s>
<s> On the other side I can't access the screw coz there's this metal plate that covers the entire side. </s>
<s> The motherboard and everthing is attached to it. </s>
<s> How do I get the HDD out of that machine? </s>
<s> I don't know if this still holds, but at one time HP provided directions on their web page to install a new hard drive. </s>
<s> You will have to input the model of your Pavilion. </s>
<s> Hope the info that you need is still there. </s>

<s> Hey I hope this will help... </s>
<s> I actually did the same thing the other day. </s>
<s> 1) Remove the Power supply 2) Unscrew the back screws and the side ones going into the metal panel. </s>
<s> 3) Flip back the system board and then the side panel should be exposed. </s>
<s> I had to install a CD-burner the other day in one of these machines. </s>
<s> Good Luck.. Ray. </s>
