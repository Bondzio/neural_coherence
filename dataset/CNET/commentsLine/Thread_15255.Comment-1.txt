i have two old gateway pc's that i have cobbled together with spare parts.
one has all of the oem software with keycodes.
i have installed ubuntu on both of them.
one of them is a p3 700, with 192 mb of ram and a 20 gb hard drive.
the other is a p3 550 with 320 mb of ram, and 2 hard drives.
os on a 10 gb and the data drive is a 20 gb.
along with crt monitors, keyboards and mice and speakers, i plan on taking the machines to goodwill.
unless i can find someone in need of a pc, i will take them tomorrow.
any idea on value of them?
they both work.
the one with the least memory has a nic card, i was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago.
the other pc only has a modem installed.
