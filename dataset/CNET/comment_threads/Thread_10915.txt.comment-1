Are Pixel Shaders and Vertex Shaders Required For Games?
I want to play Left 4 Dead, but their is one problem.
Vertex Shader Ver.
: Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.1 Pixel Shader Ver.
: Required - 2.0 , I have - 1.3 Can I run that game at all?
I understand the game performance may be bad but I am willing to change some settings.
So my question is, will the game even start up, even if I lower the settings?
Thanks
