I am running 10.5.8 on a MacBook Pro, using an HP Photosmart Premium all-in-one.
I just scanned a 38-page document - all type, no graphics - and it ended up being 217 mg. Obviously too big to mail or do anything with.
I tried to compress it, but it only compressed down to 117 mg. Any idea what I am doing wrong?
Thanks!
