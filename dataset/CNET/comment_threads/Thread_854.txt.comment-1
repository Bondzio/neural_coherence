Hi I use win 7 OS and it is 1 yr old Dell Optiplex 780 desktop.
I had no issue when it was new to put the machine in hybernation, now it does not go into the hybernation mode!
Also it does not recognize the external HD ...
I cant backup my data files No problem with the USB it recognizes it so no problem with the USB port.
If some one has any suggestion what is causing this issue Thank you Pat
