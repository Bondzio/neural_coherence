sometimes when i start my computer all of my internet connections have disappeared in the network connections folder but i am still able to connect to the internet when outlook express or internet explorer brings up the connection window.
if i try to create the connection it says a connection with the same name already exists, but i can't see it.
restarting often brings the connections back but whenever this happens none of my computers on my lan are able to connect to the network due to no ip adress being assigned, the connections are bridged in the computrer with the dial up modem.
this only started occuring when the network cards for the lan were installed.
would a hub solve the problem so the computer doesn't have to manage all the network connections?
