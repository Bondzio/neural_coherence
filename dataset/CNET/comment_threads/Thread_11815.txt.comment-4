I'd go to Tom's Hardware and see the options for GPUs at various price points .. link below.
Just make sure you pick a GPU that doesn't require more power than your current PSU can deliver ... otherwise you'll end up having to buy a more robust PSU too.

Keep in mind the GPU could be used in a newer PC if desired whereas DDR2 is an older technology and not likely of use in a newer PC.
Let us know how it works out.
