The DVD ROM drive functionality is in question. Windows sees this as a CD-ROM drive. Nowhere have I run into any DVD ROM driver info for this seemingly generic device. I tried the AIDA and Sandra utilities, and both cannot ID the manufacturer, and every description of the device is simply &quot;DVDROM 1 0x&quot;. Wondering if anyone has encountered the same situation and can lend any expertise as to this drive's true identity. Happy Weekend Jay

Windows 98 didn't know about DVDROM drives and would report it as a CDROM except in some well installed instances. For example, very few know how to install this old OS anymore. 99% of the time, the motherboard drivers don't get installed. Beyond that, it's just a very old OS that didn't know about such a drive. If it plays a DVD with the DVD software, then it's done. Bob
