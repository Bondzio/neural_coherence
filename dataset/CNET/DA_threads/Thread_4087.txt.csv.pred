1.1.1	I recently got a new computer and NETGEAR WGR614 router and i installed my guild wars game onto the cpu .	St
1.1.2	when i go to login , it gave me an error saying i couldnt connect .	St
1.1.3	i went to the guild wars support site and found i need to have ports 80 and 6112 open .	St
1.1.4	i went and configured them .	St
1.1.5	i added both to fowarding and was still not able to connect .	St
1.1.6	then i tried to add them to triggering , but i can only add Port 6112. when i put 80 in , it says i cant use it .	St
1.1.7	is there a way to put it in or do i have to do something else .	St
1.2.1	nevermind , i re-installed an it works fine	St
