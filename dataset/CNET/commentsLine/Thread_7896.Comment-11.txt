this may sound totally stupid, but i'm told by my dad (who set up the network originally but is as clueless as i as to how to fix this) that we don't have a router and i have no memory of ever dealing with one.
i'm not really sure, i understand so little about dns but in everything i've looked at everything relating to dns has checkboxes saying &quot;assign dns automatically&quot; or something along those lines.
