<s> Hi, Right now, I am in need of a printer to do satisfy my everyday work. </s>
<s> I've taken a look at some printers that have caught my eye, namely the Epson Stylus C45. </s>
<s> I am aiming for a printer that is affordable (not enough allowance to fund expensive printers). </s>
<s> By affordable, I mean that it has to be cheap in black ink; since it's what I use more often. </s>
<s> Please advise my on what my next printer should be. </s>
<s> Cheers, Carlo </s>
<s> Jiust bought one for my wife. </s>
<s> I have always bought HP, but this one seemed just right for her. </s>
<s> $79.99 before $20.00 rebate. </s>
