crucial.com says the maximum total ram is 384mb (3x 128mb modules).
i have a similar computer (gateway performance 500).
adding the third ram module will provide the greatest performance boost for xp and should improve boot times.
i also run pclinuxos on that 500mhz piii computer.
i upgraded my hard drive from 20gb (ata/66, 7200rpm, 512kb cache) to a 120gb (ata/100, 7200rpm, 8mb cache).
i also upgraded my ata/66 hdd controller card to a ata/100 model (ata/133 would also be compatible).
the hard drive is faster and quieter.
