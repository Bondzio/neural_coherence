Flat out some HDs are very quiet and what noise you do hear are &quot;whirrr&quot; or slight &quot;ac-changs&quot; during seeks, but overall still very low.
During intense operation it maybe slightly noisier.
Take this all with a grain of salt, because sometimes what you really hear is the &quot;resonance&quot; that metal-to-metal contact makes when too tighten or loose mounting.
This is common in desktop operation to have some noise.
However, you gave &quot;NO DETAILS&quot; of your setup, so any answer could vary.
If it now more noisier than when you 1st had it installed, then it maybe R/W to an area of the HD which allows more resonance to travel easier but it still falls into wear&tear of operation, expect some noise.
Also, don't mistake HD for fan noise, that can happen too.
