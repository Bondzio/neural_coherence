I didn't have to do anything to make this work.
If you have a HT enabled CPU, and have either XP pro or XP home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media, then HT worked fine for me.
I got in a older HP media cenetr PC that was stripped except for the cpu and MoBo.
Three finger csalute the machine and see how many CPUs taskmanager sees.
If that doesn't work I will look in the Bios.
