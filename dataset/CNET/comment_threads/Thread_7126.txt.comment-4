If you don't then please use the &quot;proper&quot; shutdown procedure for any printer, suaully hitting the printer's own power-OFF button.
Don't use a power strip, you didn't mention.
Infrequent usage is common problem for many printer's as the &quot;capping mechanism&quot; is very simple and truly places a rubber cap upon the printhead to seal against the outside.
Wear&tear plus any ink build-up can allow a small gap to appear and increase the lilelyhood of dried nozzles.
The best defense against this is to actaully power-ON the printer even if not used to allow it to &quot;cycle&quot; through as a basic reflooding of the ink pathways and/or simple complete test printout to &quot;refresh&quot; nozzles, otherwise intense cleaning and actions as you've stated are required.
The Lexmark Z-series are simple printers so you get what you pay for.
There are better designed(expensive to Lexmark) printers though still simple that do a better job but they too fall prey to infrequent usage, again the advice applies above.
