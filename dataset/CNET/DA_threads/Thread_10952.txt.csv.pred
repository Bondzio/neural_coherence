1.2.1	If you still suspect heat as a possible cause , then open the case and place a floor fan and blow air on it and see if it still hangs .	St
1.2.2	Sadly , no search here , wish there was one .	St
1.2.3	From your thread it looks as if you have eliminated the P/S .	St
1.2.4	Here I assume you went larger , not just the same in case it is an underpower situation .	St
1.2.5	Remove / unplug everything you do n't need ( sound cards , other IDE devices ( CDROM , FLOPPY ) and USB , Parallel and serial devices and see if it still hangs ?	Ques
1.2.6	If not add them back in one at a time and see when it starts to hang .	St
1.2.7	Try to eliminate possibilities .	St
1.2.8	What PCI devices do you have and consider moving to different PCI slots .	St

1.3.1	Thanks man , I 'll try the floor fan thing when I get home .	St
1.3.2	I 'm already down to the bare essentials only with just the video card in there .	St

1.5.1	I still keep thinking power supply .	St
1.5.2	I believe there are many Gateway , Dell , eMachines and HPs out there that use & quot ; mini-ATX & quot ; power supplies , if that is what you have from what I 've seen , many are only 80 or 100 watt .	St
1.5.3	Marginal IMHO .	St
1.5.4	Look at the BIOS setup , while you are there choose a & quot ; failsafe & quot ; mode if available .	St
1.5.5	Often in the many newer BIOS setups you will be see CPU voltage and teperature .	St
