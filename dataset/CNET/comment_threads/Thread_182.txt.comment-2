They are new and it's time to call the maker to make good on the machines.
That's why some don't build their own machines... -&gt; If you are on the hook to fix it, dive into the Event Viewer for clues.
A recent fix found there was an audio driver that was from the supplied CD.
Updated that and no more random boot.
Makes you wonder why they pack a defective driver on the CD?
