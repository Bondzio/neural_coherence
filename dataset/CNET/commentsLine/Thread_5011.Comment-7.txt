won't get the best bang for the gamimg buck.
cpu: amd athlon 64 x2 $210 (which one ???)
-as per suggestion.
still recommend intel c2d as cpu ....clearly the cpu of choice for today's pc.
motherboard: asus m2n32-sli deluxe $140 -made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire.
still recommend mb for intel platform such as the abit ip35 pro  $159.99 after $20 rebate ram: ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig (a-data $28x2= $56) and 2x512 mb (wintec $20x2= $40).
-as per suggestion.
personally i'd buy the 4gb now and decide how to best use it afterwards.
believe you can use it all with the 64bit version of windows.
it's unbelievably cheap today.
hard-drive: western digital wd1600ys 160gb 7200 rpm sata 3.0 gb/s, 16mb cache.
$60.
-still not wanting space as much as speed.
i wanted something with higher rpm, but i wasn't sure if sata 150 was compatible with the motherboard, so i went for this.
for peanuts more you can get a 320gb or 400gb sata see here  psu: coolmax ctg-850 atx 12v 850w.
$230 -i tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended, but they didn't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage i wanted.
i think this one has all the cables i'll need, but i'll research it more later on.
******read here for best info re psus .
.
.
and then check newegg.com again .
.they've got psus from 100w to 1200w and prices with shipping are usually quite competitive.
and by all means ...read the buyer comments...they're usually quite helpful and informative and helpful.
