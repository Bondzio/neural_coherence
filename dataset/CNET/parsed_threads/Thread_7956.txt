<s> Ok I have a 22&quot; LCD westinghouse (LCM-22w3). </s>
<s> I have an older Dell dimension desktop 8250 with a Nvidia GeForce4 MX 420 (old I know). </s>
<s> It was worked beautifully and had great resolution since I bought the monitor in late 07. </s>
<s> Never had a SINGLE problem. </s>
<s> So I turn off my computer yesterday and go shopping. </s>
<s> Come home and my resolution is absolutely shot. </s>
<s> My desktop font and icons are blurry, along with the desktop background picture. </s>
<s> I have adjusted the resoltuion from 800X600 all the way up to 1600X1200 etc. </s>
<s> The icons get smaller and windows adjust, but consistantly it is blurry with pictures, font, graphics, etc. </s>
<s> I have spent the last day installing and re-installing drivers (using driver sweeper in regular and safe mode, getting rid of old ones drivers, resintalling, etc etc). </s>
<s> I have googled countless things and have tried everything I can. </s>
<s> Nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> My Device Manager says the &quot;device&quot; is working properly. </s>
<s> I have added the drivers manually, I have had windows find them, I have shown windowns the location etc (all these times compltetely uninstalling the old drivers and reinstalling again). </s>
<s> I have used my old drivers disk and also the new updated drivers from the NVIDIA website I am at a loss. </s>
<s> I don't know what it could be. </s>
<s> It is just a plug and play monitor with auto adjust with does nothing really. </s>
<s> Yes I unchecked shadows for text and did/undid clear font, that is not the problem in the least. </s>
<s> It went from 1600X 1200 excellent resolution to absolute garbage. </s>
<s> Now here is the strange part. </s>
<s> I have tested two games, battlefield vietnam and solider of fortune. </s>
<s> The resolutions seems to be just as good, but it does seems a little strange as far as how fluid it is and also there is these very subtle but annoying verticle lines running the length of the monitor. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> I am at a total loss. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Easiest check is to hook another monitor to system see what result you have, am suspecting video issue with system, which mean Vid card replacement. </s>
<s> But as I said, get another monitor to hook up, easy way to tell if it is the monitor or video problem within system. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> any other res will look 'fuzzy' http://www.westinghousedigital.com/details.aspx?itemnum=108 </s>
