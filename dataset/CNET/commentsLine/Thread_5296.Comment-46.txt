many motherboards offer an integrated graphics card but the better boards also have a slot for you to install your own hand selected video graphics card .
you will need to double check the hp offering to see if it has the ability to add a card into the system should you be disappointed with using just the integrated adapter.
personally i am not that keen on integrated vga ports as they have to share on board ram and the chipset is often not as good as say a dedicated nvidia or ati card.
that aside the integrated vga port will work if all you need to do is use office programs , surf the net and access email.
i have not seen a big enough performance gain by adding in a cheap low end card so you may need to consider adding in a decent graphics card (my preference is nvidia 9600 or better) but if you are looking at high quality games you may need to go better again.
that will cost some serious dollars so that is something you will need to weigh up.
if it was my pc i would definitely be looking to add in a separate video graphics card .. the harder quaestion to answer there is which card , which chipset , how much ram do i need on that card -1 gb usually is enough and what resolution can i drive that card up to.
monitors can now display up to hd definition so thats another consideration.
hope that helps you.
