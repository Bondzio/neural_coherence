Well Bob I understand what you're saying here, only thing is this happens to only the 6792-6794 machines nothing else.
Hard to believe that the no protection from the delete key or any spyware would just be targeting only these machines.
I might also mention that these machines are among the model of the known problem of swelling, leaking capacitors adjacent to the processor which causes involuntary reboots and or shutdowns.
I have only discovered one machine thus far with the capacitor problem in the ones I support but know of many others.
