<s> I have a dell laptop that will lose signal while on line and will sometime lose connection. </s>
<s> Distence from router is not a problem. </s>
<s> It will lose signal at five foot from router. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on correcting this problem will be welcomed. </s>
<s> If the answer is yes, make sure you do not have ANY device broadcasting at the same frequency in the general area. </s>
<s> I struggled for months with my Dell laptop and a wireless connection. </s>
<s> I changed routers, changed cards in the laptop, added antennas, and still no luck! </s>
<s> I still lost signals, had very weak connections, etc. </s>
<s> I didn't think it was interference because our wireless telephones were using 5.8 MHz. </s>
<s> Then I realized that an old wireless audio headset that I had not used in a very long time still had its base station powered on. </s>
<s> It broadcasts at the same frequency as Wireless-G. Sure enough, as soon as I turned the power to the base station off, ALL the problems cleared up! </s>
<s> Geeesh! </s>
