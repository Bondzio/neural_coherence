I was in the process of changing my power supply when the bulb in the lamp I was using exploded in front of the open case.
After cleaning up the mess I continued with the installation.
I pushed the power button and the PC wouldn't come on.
So I took the new one out and put the old one back in same result no power.
The green LED light comes on but when I push power it goes out then comes back on but nothing turns on.
Could the bulb exploding have damaged my motherboard.
