I'm considering buying a netbook that comes with Windows 7 Starter.
I checked Microsoft's &quot;check-list&quot; to compare Starter to Windows 7 Home Premium.
It seems to me Starter edition would simply eliminate much of the &quot;fluff&quot; and not much that would be really missed.
Can anybody say what reasons one may be disatisfied with Starter on a netbook?
