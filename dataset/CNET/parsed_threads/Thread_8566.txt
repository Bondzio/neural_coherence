<s> here's a question, I have a very fancy surge protector here . </s>

<s> and my motherboard recently died right after a big electrical storm. </s>
<s> my question is, since these surge protectors guarantee to protect you, how do you prove it didn't?? </s>
<s> and get reinbmursed for the fried mobo? </s>
<s> --fj ps just an aside, now I can't connect to my cable modem thru the surge protector, i have to go direct to the computer. </s>
<s> not sure if it's the cable or the box tho . </s>

<s> The problem is that there was more than one electrical path to the PC. </s>
<s> You've lost the discussion since you had other electrical paths for damage to occur. </s>
<s> Sorry to hear about your loss. </s>

<s> hi bob-- I had only one path-- thru the surge protector. </s>
<s> it was a fancy one that allowed for the high speed internet cable to go thru, so all wires leading into the computer (and power for all its peripherals) went thru the surge protector. </s>
<s> so i repeat my question: how do I prove the mobo failure was caused by the surge protector's failure to protect it and not just the mobo dying a natural death? </s>
<s> -- fj (fyi, currently the internet cable does not work if it goes thru the surge protector in-outs . </s>

<s> sorry if that was confusing, it WAS going thru the surge protector before) </s>
<s> I take it you have some warranty or recourse in recouping the PC because the surge protector did its job. </s>
<s> The best surge protector no matter what brand can only &quot;reduce/limit&quot; the damage to a system. </s>
<s> If you're lucky, it stops damage other than itself, otherwise it migrates down the path taking the weakest componets out. </s>
<s> A simple electrical surge is reduced or stopped but a &quot;electrical/lighting&quot; hit is another matter, you're dealing with the big stuff well into millions of volts or its range of joules potential. </s>
<s> Just call or inform the surge protector co., that after a surge, the system wasn't running when it was before. </s>
<s> You shouldn't need to anything other than that. </s>
<s> You can place your system elsewhere to see if it powers-up w/o the surge protector, etc.. good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> You had a cable modem in the brew as well. </s>
<s> That's another path. </s>
<s> The damage would have to be very evident such as parts blown off the board for them to say it was the protection device that failed to protect. </s>
<s> Sorry to hear about your loss, but seeing PC failures daily for a multitude of reasons I can only write that it's doubtful since the power supply is next in line for the line voltage to cause an issue and fail. </s>
<s> Not the motherboard. </s>
