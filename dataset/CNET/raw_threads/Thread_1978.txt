For example the printer will not print if the printer driver is missing or corrupted. Your computer may not give any audio through the speakers if the sound driver is corrupted. If you have the original driver CD or disk, then insert it.. The CD/DVD/USB should auto run to and Windows will automatically install all the necessary drivers on its own..
