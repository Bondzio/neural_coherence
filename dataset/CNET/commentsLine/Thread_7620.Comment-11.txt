sorry i didn't suggest to update the firmware sooner.
my earlier questions were to make sure that what you had observed as a problem wasn't just the router functioning as configured.
when you provided some of the relevant router settings, it looked like something else was wrong.
if you update software (os, drivers, etc.)
on your comuters, it can make commuincation with a router problematic.
unfortunately, the router manuals i've seen don't stress enough the importance of firware updates to solve problems.
also, firmware may become corrupted.
glad it's fixed.
happy networking!
