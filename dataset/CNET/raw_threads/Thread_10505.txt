THE ISSUE: I've been plugging computer right into ethernet wall jack in garage (now my office), but would like to have wireless capability in there. The current wireless signal from main router is weak to non-existant (won't reach due to distance, walls, etc.) THE QUESTION: What device (if any) can I connect to the ethernet jack in garage (office) that will allow me to get a wireless feed off of existing internet connection? Is this possible? Booster? Thank you.
