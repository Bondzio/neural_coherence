i have a similar setup.
connect your mac to your printer.
on each pc, download bonjour for windows (its free on apple's website - just google bonjour for windows), and it's very self explanatory from there.
it works perfectly.
leave it to apple to straighten out windows networking mess.
the only downside is that the mac has to be awake in order to print from any of the computers.
