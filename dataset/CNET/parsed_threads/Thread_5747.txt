<s> I have a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000 Keyboard / Mouse and the Snap In Mini 2.4 Ghz Wireless USB Mini Transceiver is damaged. </s>
<s> Microsoft does not sell just this part you have to buy a new combo set. </s>
<s> Does any other brands have one that will work with this model and where might I buy one? </s>
<s> Being it is very light duty it is fragile so I am wondering if it is worth finding one or is there a better system Wireless Keyboard / Mouse that is a bit more durable? </s>
<s> I have gone thru 3 Microsoft models so far one had the space bar stop working, the next was the corded transceiver would come and go and now this. </s>
<s> It is for home use mostly. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I am trying to keep it under 75.00 if possible I have spent about 325.00 on the three I have had... Buy would prefer to just buy a replacement tranceiver if there is such a thing that will work this this keyboard / mouse?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Anyone use a wireless keyboard and mouse with a 2,4 ghx transceiver??? </s>
<s> Appears no one has had to buy just the MINI Transceiver I guess??? </s>
<s> Newaygo1 </s>
<s> It appears there is no parts for such a thing. </s>
<s> Well when I called Microsoft looking for a replacement Part they advise they don't sell just the Mini Transceiver but suggest I could buy another brand that would work but if I wanted a Mircosoft wireless keyboard and mouse I would have to buy a complete new combo... </s>
<s> But since they don't sell just the part I need I thought better to just buy another brand transceiver and learn it won't work. </s>
<s> It just gets costly to buy another new combo but I guess that is why we are a &quot;Throwaway Society&quot; and that is not what the USA was built on it was more service economy today everything is not serviceable 99% of anything electronic is that way. </s>
<s> They aren't made to service which is just adding to the landfills... Oh well thanks looks like I will just yet another combo set when all I need is a tranceiver just wished it was much more Durable the transceiver is the low quality as to being durable but when that is all you can get / use you buy what you can and try and get by!!! </s>
<s> So I am going on my forth one in 2 years... Might have to go back to the Corded Keyboard &amp; Mouse even though you have to keep it connected you don't have to worry about something else failing that the wireless are prone to do... </s>
<s> So much for Microsoft quality until it got bumped one time and it no longer works... Newaygo1 </s>
<s> I spoke with Microsoft parts department today and they said a specialized computer shop can sell you a (universal) 2.4 Ghz transceiver that should work. </s>
<s> Take the keyboard or mouse with you to the store when purchasing the transceiver. </s>
<s> Microsoft has a 3 year warranty on the desktop sets, I just called and replaced my 2000 desktop set as the transceiver died also and they are paired to the device at the factory and cannot be field repaired. </s>
<s> Go to the microsoft website under support and look for replacement/defective parts. </s>
<s> i droped my kboard and the mini tranceiver broke is there a way to get the tranceiver only </s>
<s> But only for units that offer pairing. </s>
<s> As you own yours, you can answer that one. </s>
