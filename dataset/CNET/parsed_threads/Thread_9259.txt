<s> Hi John, Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I currently have no way to hook my laptop into our system. </s>
<s> It is a very odd arrangement and old with just one mic and cord that runs approx. </s>
<s> 30' under the platform to a box that allows us to control the volume. </s>
<s> I was hopeing for a solution that would allow me to use a wireless mic that would be picked up by some type of sensor off of the USB on my laptop. </s>
<s> I would then use Nero or Roxio to do the actual recording. </s>
<s> Do you have any further thoughts? </s>

<s> The existing microphone has to go to some type of mixer or mixer/amp, and then out of the amp to the speakers in the room. </s>
<s> You could place a mixer with more than one output before the amp. </s>
<s> Use one output for the speakers in the room, and use the other to connect to the audio input (line-in) in the laptop. </s>
<s> If your laptop doesn't have one, you can get an external USB box or a PC-Card model. </s>
<s> I don't know how your odd and old hardware will behave with these devices, though. </s>
<s> USB box: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductCompare.asp?CompareItemList=N82E16829102167,N82E16829121121&SubCategory=57 Creative makes a PC-Card model: http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=1&subcategory=204&product=10769 Look at the ''Typical Sound System'' diagram on P.8 of this link: http://www.shure.com/pdf/booklets/audio_for_houses_of_worship.pdf (Shure makes great microphones) You could have a parallel sound system. </s>
<s> You could just tape a cheap USB mic to your existing mic and run the line to your laptop that will record right behind the podium. </s>
<s> Looking for something more elegant like wireless, huh? </s>
<s> I don't know of any wireless USB microphones (other than telephone headsets), but there are good wireless microphones that will transmit to a receiver. </s>
<s> You, then, could run a line out of the wireless receiver to your a mic port on your computer's external audio box. </s>
<s> http://www4.shopping.com/xFS?FD=0&KW=wireless+microphone OR MAKE IT EASY: 1. </s>
<s> Visit a local electronics store that caters to musicians or a musical instrument showroom. </s>
<s> Ask how they would do it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Visit RadioShack and ask them what they would do. </s>
<s> This gives me alot to think over and to research. </s>
<s> Thanks for taking the time to write out some detailed ideas. </s>
