can i ask why you installed vlc player?
this is a cross-platform media player that for the most part, is not even needed on the mac.
did you by chance download a pc version of this program?
it may be possible that vlc player has been set to override every other program and become the default video player.
why not delete this and see what happens?
(back it up just in case.)
unfortunately there have been too many pc people who gravitate to the mac and they download a lot of crap that they don't need, but they do it because it was required on a pc and they are determined to try and operate the mac like the pc.
scrape your mac clean (backup and do a fresh reinstall of software as the boss here recommended) and start with a clean slate.
