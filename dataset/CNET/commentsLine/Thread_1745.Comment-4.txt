i'm having problems with ups maker and the lifetime insurance they offer.
i have a somewhat fried computer from a blackout.
i can tell you a $100-150 one will not work as a $40-50 surge protecter.
i won't but a cheap ups again it's a waste of money.
the reason why is the cheaper ups/battery backups do not protect from sine wave problems, although rare these can & usually occur with a blackout, brownout, or spike.
these can kill a computer chips quick.
also cheaper ups is not good for brownout or spikes, so if you buy a cheaper ups you are buy a false sense of security and a fight should you get zapped.
oh, watch the wireless in a thunderstorm lightning can get you if are close enough to a strike.
i got zapped, so good luck
