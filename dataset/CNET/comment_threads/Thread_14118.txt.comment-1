Yesterday I decided to clean out the dust inside my desktop, so I removed the RAM, video card and 2 fans, that's it.
After cleaning it out, I put it all back in.
Plugged everything in and powered on my computer.
The computer makes the sounds it normally does when It's powered on, but the monitor had an orange light, meaning there is power to the monitor but it isn't connected to a computer.
Yes, I made sure the monitor was hooked in well, not loose or anything, I've checked and am pretty sure the video card is in properly.
Any ideas?
I hope it's something obvious I might have missed.
