i'm guessing your post about the wd external drive stands for western digital.
i had a similar experience with my wd at around 18 months.
i had valuable pictures and documents on their drive.
something happened within my system whereby i could no longer access my saved files.
being the drive was under warranty i called wd.
they said i had a corrputed file that messed up their entire drive.
they said the solution was to reformat the drive and reload their program.
but, they quickly said, that in doing so i would loose all stored data.
that was the extent of their willingness to help.
i called a few places that deal in file recovery.
i couldn't afford their prices.
i crushed the wd drive and now use jump drives or flash drives.
good luck.
