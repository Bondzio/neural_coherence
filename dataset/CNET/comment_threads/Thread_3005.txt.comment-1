I just purchased a new Dell PC which runs Windows Vista.
I would like to connect the harddrive from my previous PC (running XP) to the harddrive for my new PC (running Vista).
After connecting the harddrives, how would I go about formatting the secondary harddrive?
Do I simply right-click the drives that appear and click format?
After formatting, how do I partition new drives for the harddrive?
Thank you.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
