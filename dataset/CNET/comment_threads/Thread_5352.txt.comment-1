Hi, i just bought a Eee PC 1201T and was wondering a couple of things 1) why does it come without an OS?
is their a reason for this?
could the drivers be un available for windows?
or could Asus be trying to pass more savings on to the coustmer?
(another interesting thing is why it doesn't show op on their website) 2) how can you you install windows 7 without an optical drive?
i have read some of the articles on how to do this but i have been unsuccessful.
i know you must format the USB drive a special way using the command prompt but i am not sure about the rest.
Thanks, Brian
