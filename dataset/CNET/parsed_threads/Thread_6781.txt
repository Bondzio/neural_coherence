<s> I have narrowed it to one of these three burner: LG GSA E10L Lite-On SHM-165P6SU Philips SPD3300CC Which one would you choose? </s>
<s> For LG, GSA-E30L (18x) is the current model. </s>
<s> For Lite-on, SHW-160P6SU (16x EZ-Dub) and LH-20A1HX (20x) are current. </s>
<s> Unless you're getting a real bargain price (&lt;$60), get a current model since they'll have better media compatibility. </s>
<s> As for Philips, they're not a major manufacturer (mostly they just relabel components built by someone else) and wouldn't consider them over LG or LiteOn. </s>
<s> I have Teac DV-W516G-PUK & it works pefectly. </s>
