<s> I just got a TV tuner card, but channels 2-9 on cable input look fuzzy even as most, but not all, other channels look better than on my 25&quot; TV. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if this has to do w. the lower resolutions on TV sets, anti-piracy protection, or what. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> Tsee, I'm having the same problem, but I believe that the cable companies signals are bad. </s>
<s> I still haven't been able to fix this problem (since Sept 2005). </s>
<s> I'm moving soon so I'll find out if it's my cable provider or not. </s>
