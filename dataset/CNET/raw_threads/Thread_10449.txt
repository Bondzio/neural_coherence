Depending on how fast you get money, some of your stuff your upgrading now will become useless! Save it for a while and build a nice new pc. Check out the &quot;new computer ~1500$ budget&quot; Thread. There's some nice desktop specs for a new PC in there for under 1500$. It's not worth upgrading little by little.
