Did that it didn't come up in windows explorer. Had a look in disk management and it was sitting there without a drive letter, it said unknown disk type, not initialized and unallocated. Now I have some very important things on this drive I need. I asked a friend what to do, he said take it back to the original pc and back it up. Did that, it comes up with the same thing. Both pc's are XP, I haven't changed it from being the slave drive and there is a master in both pc's. Can someone help me?

Maybe you had XP SP3 but didn't tell. That doesn't matter as I have to take your word here and use that for clues. Also there is not much else in your post to use for clues. If you want other ideas, tell more. Bob

I suspect that the HD in the original system wasn't readable or available, it will repeat the same problem on another system. If that's the case, then what is the original problem or reason to try to recover data. Once, that's explained we can go from there. Otherwise, you may not be resolving the real problem. Please explain system specs and details or order to give a some resolution. tada -----Willy

I recommend you a product Data Recovery Wizard I'm so appreciate it and it has saved me many times. Don't write anything new to this hard drive before you could confirm that you have recovered the files.
