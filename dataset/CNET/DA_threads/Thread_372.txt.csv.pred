1.1.1	Hi, Not long ago I upgraded my system's ram from 1GB to 2GB to somewhat improve my system's performance, I'm running Windows XP sp2 2GB RAM AMD Athlon 64 3000+ (1.87 GHz) Nvidia GeForce 6200 512MB Turbocache It's not the fastest system but it's been running fine so far, My question is: I use my system to create my family DVDs and photo albums with the aid of various DVD authoring software but i recently noticed that my CPU usage while authoring was at 100% which is understandable as it's not dualcore and it's not the best out there but my RAM was 1500MB free about 74% free, Is there a way to commit RAM to aid the CPU in processing?	St
1.1.2	(I would not like to overclock the CPU as I am not too savvy there as i could cause some serious harm to my system) I once used a diagnostics software called SiSandra or something similar and i think it had an option to use free RAM to help the CPU, but i'm not sure how i would go about it, What would you recommend for me to make use of the free RAM instead of the CPU sweating at 100% usage and the RAM lazing about, Many thanks in advance for any replies	St
1.2.1	When rendering a DVD your CPU should be consumed by the task.	St
1.2.2	Memory isn't the issue here but the computations needed to render the work.	St

1.3.1	Write to or read from the DVD will bring delay, so it is different from hard drive.	St
1.3.2	When you start a new task, CPU will consume part of the resource to calculate and carry out this task.	St
1.3.3	The best way is opening Task Manager and checking which process tie up too much resource.	St
1.3.4	If anyone is useless at this time, you may close it.	Ques
