1.1.1	HP OFFICE JET J6400 .	St
1.1.2	( computers use Vista ) Hp did an automatic fix , then sent a message that I might have to reinstall the software , because i might lose my wireless connection .	St
1.1.3	I did .	St
1.1.4	MY Problem : I have two computers and problem is with both .	St
1.1.5	I reinstalled the software .	St
1.1.6	The computer recognizes my wireless network name but when I enter my & quot ; key code & quot ; it will not accept it .	St
1.1.7	This is the correct code .	St
1.1.8	Result is that my printers will not work with the computers .	St
1.1.9	Also my wireless connects with all of my other hardware in the house .	St
1.1.10	So no problem with the wireless .	St
1.1.11	Help please	St
1.2.1	I fixed one like this recently .	St
1.2.2	They had some firewall software and after I added this to its ALLOW list they remember they had to do that before as well .	St
1.2.3	What made them think it was not the firewall was that the printer was found and there was that key code box .	St
1.2.4	I uninstalled the firewall software during setup and later , after the printing was working reinstalled the firewall which is when the popup popped up to ask for permission for the printer connection .	St
1.2.5	The ugly part of this was the popup did not mention it was for the printer but I knew that was what it was for .	St
1.2.6	Imagine that .	St
1.2.7	The makers think we know this .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	That was exactly the problem .	St
1.3.2	I find the constant stream of updates from HP a real annoyance .	St
