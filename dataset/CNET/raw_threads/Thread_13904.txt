I am also in the market to purchase a new router. I am trying to decide if I should purchase a router with a usb port or a separate storage device for my network. I don't want to spend too much since all the NAS devices I have found are at least $200, but I have read bad reviews about accessing data through a routers usb port. Thoughts?
