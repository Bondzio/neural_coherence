i'd say you'd be well to consider them again.
it's always a crap shoot.
you could select a good brand and model but have trouble with yours.
look for monthly duty cycles and err on the conservative side just to be sure.
you'll find today's lot of printers to seemingly lack sturdiness compared to those of old but they will cost much less.
if you want it to be other than a throw away when it breaks....and it will break....get a business class model but expect to pay plenty more for it.
i've had experience in my work with hp, oki and lexmark.
of the three, i prefer hp for reliability.
you're experiences could be different...can't offer much more.
