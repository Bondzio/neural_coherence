let's also compare it to an hp photojet that prints a 4x6 in 40 seconds, and a lexmark that will print a 4x6 in 55 seconds.
technology as i konw it is designed to speed things up, not slow them down.
i was very dissappointed in that 2 minute print time.
the print quality was a+ excellent in the epson, and if anyone has the time and patience, i would recommend that printer.
but if your printing many photos and have little patience like myself, look elsewhere.
