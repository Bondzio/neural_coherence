1.2.1	While VIVO ( Video-In , Video-Out ) may look promising to connect your PS2 to said PC to play your game , many dis the display quality since you do n't get much better than TV pixels .	St
1.2.2	Also it may not be & quot ; real-time & quot ; or lag free enough .	St
1.2.3	I will share that my simpler choices of PC TV/Capture cards are near realtime ( games hate lag ) and cost about 49 or less bucks .	St

1.3.1	a USB video tuner card ( I used it on my laptop to watch hotel movies ) .	St
1.3.2	Plug it into a USB port on my desktop , start the TV software and set to ''device '' , plug the game into the A/V plugs on the tuner card , and go for it .	St
1.3.3	Any good quality internal TV card will work also .	St
