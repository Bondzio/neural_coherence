<s> One solution as mentioned is a dedicated PCI capture card. </s>
<s> This will require opening the case and it does draw from your already limited PSU. </s>
<s> Another solution is an external device. </s>
<s> This has the advantage of; being completely portable, eliminating the need for opening up the case, having its own power supply. </s>
<s> I use an ATI TV Wonder USB 2.0 capture device. </s>
<s> Here is a link to one review that gives some pretty good info on the device. </s>

<s> Moderators tend to view top posts with links to products to sometimes be spam. </s>
<s> But you have many other posts so this post doesn't fall on that side of the fence. </s>
<s> Thanks for posting the information and let me share I've used many versions of ATI and Hauppaugge products over the years with equal success and aspirin consumption with both makes. </s>
