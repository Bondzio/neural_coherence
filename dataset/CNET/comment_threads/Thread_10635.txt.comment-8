Well I went into BIOS and I got to a screen that showed the CPU frequency at 200 and underneath that it had a ratio of 6:5 to RAM of 166 MHZ I couldn't find anything that said &quot;FSB&quot; or &quot;Front Side Bus&quot; anywhere.
Where in BIOS am I supposed to find it?
Is it the RAM setting underneath that needs to be higher?
