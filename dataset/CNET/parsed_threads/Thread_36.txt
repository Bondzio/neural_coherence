<s> I have a 500 gig seagate external hard drive which I use to back up pictures of my son and friends and whatnot from my recently purchased dell laptop with windows vista. </s>
<s> I also back up on disc. </s>
<s> I took the external drive to a friends and hooked it up to his mac. </s>
<s> It worked fine for a while as I put a few of his music files on it, then I walked away from it for about an hour and came back to find it showing the disc space as being full but not having any files. </s>
<s> Then the panic sets in. </s>
<s> So I got a new external and have spent days taking pics off discs and transfering to the new one, but I have many discs that are old and don't read and now realize that I have lost a good chunk of my sons childhood pictures, and many of my friends', despite my best efforts to back everything up twice. </s>
<s> So does anyone know if the seagate being hooked up to a mac could have done some random reformatting or if it sounds like a virus from the music files? </s>
<s> Should I try scanning it or send it to data doctors to pay a bunch and probably not get anything back? </s>
<s> I don't know! </s>
<s> any help would be appreciate greatly! </s>
<s> The originals should be fine so why not wipe and start over? </s>
<s> Unless this is not a backup and is instead &quot;storage.&quot; In this forum we have some resolutions and fixes. </s>
<s> Here they are in quick fire form. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Remove the drive and place it as slave in a desktop. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Copy the files out. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Not showing up? </s>
<s> Try each of these titles found with google. </s>
<s> a. GETDATABACK b. </s>
<s> ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY 4. www.drivesavers.com usually does a great job. </s>
<s> But is this a backup or storage is the real question. </s>
<s> If backup, that's one thing. </s>
<s> But storage you will find you need a backup plan. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the help, I am going to try those suggestions. </s>
<s> I suppose it would be storage and backup. </s>
<s> I had my pictures stored on another drive in the house that just crashed last week and then all I had was the backup on my external which then became my storage and then did this weird thing days after the other hard drive crash. </s>
<s> But I still had other backup on the discs, of which most aren't reading now either. </s>
<s> Grr... </s>
<s> If it was all back up then I would be fine, but like dominoes, I lost 3 different places of storage and backup. </s>
<s> Backup is backup. </s>
<s> You saved some or xfer some music files to your ext. </s>
<s> HD, that suggests more for storage. </s>
<s> While you think it can do that, the fact reminds in your experience you found that storage use is making backup use in doubt. </s>
<s> Plainly put, use it for one or the other and only on your system. </s>
<s> if you want to xfer files from MAC to IBM, etc. </s>
<s> use a flash drive that way the lost of only that data is at risk. </s>
<s> The resolutions Robert provided is about it, if your problem persists, you're stuck. </s>
<s> Also, backup should include any data burned to CD/DVD as well for yet another source of backup. </s>
<s> Up to you on a recovery process, the value you place on it. </s>
<s> As for the probable cause, if you read these forums anything is possible. </s>
<s> Someone could have handled the ext. </s>
<s> HD not thinking it was ON. </s>
<s> As for virus, scan it or system to exclude that. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Reread my last post. </s>
<s> This seems so consequential as you now explain you have a previous crashed HD and now your ext. </s>
<s> HD is kaput too. </s>
<s> Either you have malware at work or you've experienced some AC elect. </s>
<s> issue to include a possible bad PSU. </s>
<s> As for malware if your friend system experiences some issue too, then its that. </s>
<s> But, because it's a MAC, it may not as an IBM type malware may not attack a MAC as well. </s>
<s> Once things settle down do an AV scan or use an online scan as well for further checking. </s>
<s> The security, virus, malware forum provides links to various pgms. </s>
<s> that can help. </s>
<s> FYI, I replied to your original post not the follow-up which may or may not been present or read. </s>
