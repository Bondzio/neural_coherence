The HP software is just unnecessarily bulky.
It slows system performance by loading a whole bunch of unnecessary apps into system memory and going in and cleaning that up is not something I'm interested in doing.
The install for one of the HP printers I have was about 700mb.
What in the world do I need 550mb of printer drivers/utilities for?
