10829	0	286952	2724269	NR	ValhallaGal	3/7/08 6:45 PM	1.2049155E12	1 monitor 2 computers	Hello, I have a pc and a Mac. However, I have programs that I use on both. I've tried using the Flip thing that lets you toggle between the two computers but all it did was cause my Mac to freeze up. So, I need to know if there is a splitter type of cable that I can use to hook up to the two computers to run off the one flat screen monitor. Also I need the same kind of cable for my printer. I searched the forums for a similar thread and couldn't find anything. Maybe I was using the wrong search words but I could only come up with stuff on using two monitors and one computer. Please help. Thanks, Donna

The &quot;Flip thing&quot; (my technical term), is actually just called &quot;Flip&quot; and it is made by Belkin. It is another KVM. You can see it Here: http://www.belkin.com/flip/ I purchased the Flip, USB with Audio (F1DG102U) that supports both PC's and Macs. But I ran into problems using this when my computer would go into idle or rest mode. When I would come back to it, and hit any key or move the mouse, my monitor would be froze on a black screen with an error message that said &quot;no signal found&quot;, or something to that effect. Causing me to have to re-start my machine. When I disconnected the Flip the problem ceased. Maybe the problem was isolated to this particular KVM. However, I'm concerned that if I purchased another KVM I'll just run into the same problems. So, there is no &quot;splitter&quot; type of cable that can be used to hook up the two machines? Thus avoiding the use of a KVM? As well as a splitter cable for the printer? Thanks again for your help and time. Donna

I even would get up from the computer and go do something else and come back and it would still be froze. This was not an isolated event. It happened allot. I would disconnect the Flip KVM for a few weeks and the problem would not reoccur. Then when the KVM was hooked up again the problem would start again. I assure you, it was not the computer sleeping.
