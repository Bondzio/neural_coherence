Have you run First Aid on your drive? Can you boot into OS X, successfully, using the OS X installation disk? P

I have two machines here with the latest OS X upgrade and they are both running 10.3.9 Are you running 10.4.9 on that machine? P

530	5	238456	2431947	2431523	mrmacfixit	3/16/07 5:01 AM	1.17402126E12	So, bring it up to date	run Repair Permissions, Disk First Aid when booted from the OS X installation disk and see if that makes any difference P

As you only have 512MB of RAM, the minimum for that machine when it was first released, there is not an easy way to check for a faulty SODIMM. Unless you have a software utility that does that for you. So, the next step is probably an Archive and Install. Boot from the installation disk and choose Archive and Install from one of the VERY early options. This is preserve your data and put a new system down on the disk. On completion, it will put your data back where it should be. Do not proceed with the installation unless you have chosen Archive and install. Failure to do so will result in ALL your data being deleted. P
