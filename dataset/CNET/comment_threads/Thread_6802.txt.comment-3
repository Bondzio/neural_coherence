stlcardsfan13, Have you found a means to do this?
I am interested in doing the same thing to distribute multiple text messages (for a new media art piece).
I am running a Mac oSX.
I am also hoping that when people respond to this text message on their mobile phones it uploads to an online blog (like Twitter).
Any suggestions would be great!
