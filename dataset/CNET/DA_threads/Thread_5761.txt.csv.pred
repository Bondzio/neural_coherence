1.1.1	Hi , I am buying an external hard drive and I heard that there are problem with portable hard drives not getting enough power from the USB port .	St
1.1.2	And I am not sure if my computer will supply enough computer when I checked in the device manager in Windows it said my USB port supplies 500MA and I am not sure if it 's enough to supply it without out having to buy a dock just to get 2 usb ports .	St
1.1.3	Thanks Dell Dimension E520	St
1.2.1	USB power is never a sure thing .	St
1.2.2	If you have a device that demands more than 1/2 the possible 500 mA then you should never chance it .	St

1.3.1	If I use a 2 USB connector will that be risking it ?	Ques
1.4.1	When it comes to USB power , the moment you go over 1/2 the available power I must write no .	St
1.5.1	PCs have multiple usb root hubs .	St
1.5.2	there are usually two or more ports per hub and each port must share the usb power output of that hub .	St
1.5.3	the hubs are shown in device manager under & quot ; Universal Serial Bus controllers. & quot ; you need to locate two ports which are on different controllers so each port will be delivering full power .	St
1.5.4	plug in any usb device ( a flash drive is ideal ) and double click each & quot ; USB Root Hub & quot ; and check the & quot ; Power & quot ; tab until you find the usb device .	St
1.5.5	then plug the device into other ports until it shows up under a different hub .	St
1.5.6	but if you 're worried , a powered usb hub will definitely give you enough juice .	St
1.6.1	Will any USB powered usb hub ?	Ques
1.7.1	Except the issue of tapping USB power for hard disks is one where it work 99 % of the time for 99 % of the people .	St
1.7.2	You seemed like you wanted it to be 100 % assured .	St
1.7.3	For that you ca n't be so sure until you get the wall adapter for power for this drive .	St

1.9.1	just like a western digital passport will work .	St
1.9.2	these drives use low power hard drives ( like those in notebooks/laptops ) and get their power solely from the usb cable .	St
1.9.3	there is no ac adapter .	St
1.9.4	older drives needed 2 ports .	St
1.9.5	newer drives only need 1 port but the hub for that port should not be shared by another device with a high power draw ( like a scanner , another portable hard drive , usb sound device , or a usb powered coffee warmer ) .	St
1.9.6	for most folks with newer pcs the & quot ; go & quot ; and & quot ; passport & quot ; are plug-and-play .	St
