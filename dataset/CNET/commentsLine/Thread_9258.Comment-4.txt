thank you for the input.
funny you should mention it, because if i were to end up going the sata route, i'd already planned on going with the wd black series (the 1 tb variant is widely available in electronics store near me).
i definitely would not want to have to use disk manager software to access the whole disk, but i was under the impression that would be an issue only if i wanted the bios to recognize the entire drive, and that winxp (sp2 and later) bypasses the bios and can recognize large drives on its own.
at least i think that's how it works, but am i missing something?
since the drive would be for data only, i don't need it to boot, so i don't care whether the bios recognizes it.
if that's true, then my main concern is whether i'd get better performance from my main drive if my data drive is on the mb pata controller, instead of being on the sata card along with said main drive.
i'm planning to move my cards around to make sure i'm not using the irq-sharing slots if possible.
i just hope tyan wasn't confused, and that it really is slots 4&5 and not 1&5.
that &quot;pci slot 1&5 irq priority&quot; setting in my bios has me questioning that.
i'm wondering if there's a &quot;usual&quot; irq pairing of two particular slots on motherboards of that type and era (haven't had any luck googling an answer to that one yet, but i do keep seeing mentions of agp sharing with a pci slot, yet another thing to be concerned about).
