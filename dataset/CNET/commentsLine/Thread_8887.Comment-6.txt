hi, thanks for the reply.
i have a 4 port linksys router.
i wasn't sure where to find the nic properties so i went to do a search on my first pc (the compaq 8000t) file search revealed a folder names nic, i right clicked and selected properties and there was the general/sharing/customize tabs... on the sharing tab there was a box - ''network and sharing box'' and the network setup wizard.
i believe this is what you said to do - correct?
i didn't follow thru w/the wizard because i wanted to see if i could do this on both pc's.
now on the new dell xps p4 2.8 i did the same search and there were allot more folders, most of which were sonic... and i think they're all software related... i didn't see a folder named ''nic'' like on the compaq?
although if i right click on the properties tab on any of the file folders in the search results i am able to see the same general/sharing/customize tabs... i was alittle confused as to why every folder would give me network sharing capabilities.
is it possible this dell pc doesn't have this capability?
the router connectivity sounds ideal, i hope i can make it work, i can also purchase and install a nic card if need be.
thank you
