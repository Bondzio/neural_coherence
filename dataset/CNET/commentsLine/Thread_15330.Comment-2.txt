you probably have access to another ac cord, swap it your monitor one and retry again.
i rarely have any incidents of bad ac cords, far more bad psus.
since, you mentioned a 10yr.
old system, well can be time to replace if you can find another similar psu if not a better one should you want to repair.
as for accessing any data/files, remove the hd and mount in ext.
usb case and/or similar adapter in order to retrieve.
google for ada-2020 adapter or locate ext.
usb cases that match your hd requirements.
