Yes, Bob, this helps a great deal.
I just got off the phone with D-Link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since March 1, 2008.
I would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day.
It's not worth my stress level at his point.
I did, however, get my money's worth since it was about 5 years old.
Tech support recommended that I upgrade to the WBR-1310 or the WBR-2310 router.
I googled these units and both are considered pieces of crap and junk by a lot of the reviewers.
I will have to steer clear of these units when shopping for my next D-Link router.
Thanks for the advice and the link.
