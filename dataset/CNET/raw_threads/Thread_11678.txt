9534	0	277787	2665679	NR	arbee	12/30/07 8:18 AM	1.19900268E12	Is an ATI 1800 Wonder card & Radeon 3870 compatible?	I have replaced my video card (ATI 1800X Wonder Card) with the new Radeon 3870. I have tried using the Wonder card for video capture only but it seems to conflict with the primary 3870. It gives me 2 extra displays, but I don't need them and disabled those displays. ATI Tech Support said it doesn't support the 1800X anymore so I cannot get any advice from them. Does anyone know how to set up the two cards to work in the same machine. They are both PCIx. I hesitate buying a new video capture card when the 1800 model is also a video capture card. Any suggestions?

I will double check again but I installed the new Asus Magnus motherboard, that has just been released, so I believed it has the most recent BIOS update. Will check though. Also have XP with SP2 and keep up with all updates. It seems something will not let me access Multimedia drivers, even though I cleaned them out (including Registry) and reinstalled the latest from ATI.

The boards are made, shipped via cargo ship, sit in warehouses for months and meanwhile bugs are found, fixed. No one updates the boards prior to final shipment. Bob
