1.
You lose the use of a PCI slot for every PCI Express X16 card inserted.
2.
Worst case scenario is that if you go with 2 video cards in SLI, you will be left with one PCI slot and one PCI-E X4 slot.
This usually is not a problem for SLI gamers who really only need PCI for a good sound card.
Everything else, excpet maybe a dial-up modem, is integrated into the motherboard.
If you need more expandability, use the PCI-E X4 slot or external hardware via USB or Firewire.
