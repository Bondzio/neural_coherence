1.1.1	Does anyone know if there is a way to enable the USB port of a TV to access video files held on a NAS drive ?	Ques
1.1.2	My aim is to access the drive via wifi or ethernet .	St
1.1.3	Presumably it would need to present the drive as a mass storage device to the TV 's USB port since that 's basically what the port picks up .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions would be most welcome .	St
1.1.5	The TV does not support DLNA and I 'm trying to avoid having to buy a separate media player e.g .	St
1.1.6	WD Live TV box .	St
1.1.7	& lt ; div & gt ; & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	This sounds like the fellow I met yesterday that wanted to make cellular phone calls without a cell phone .	St
1.2.2	Rather than upset him I just nodded a lot .	St
1.2.3	For you my nod is to the Logitech Revue .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hear what you 're saying but the budget wo n't stretch that far !	St
1.3.2	Is there any kit which might achieve what I 'm looking for ?	Ques
1.3.3	I imagine others will have considered this as it would seem to be an obvious solution to centrally accessing media files for viewing on the telly .	St
1.3.4	A lot of modern TVs have pretty good built in media players .	St
1.3.5	But is it possible ?	Ques
1.4.1	Because such needs some little computer in a box ( like the Revue and such ) and that I limit explanations to 3 or less paragraphs let 's go with this .	St
1.4.2	- & gt ; What have you found that does what you want for your price ?	Ques
1.4.3	If nothing then what happens if you try the 99 buck price ?	Ques
1.4.4	And wait , wait , do n't tell me about the Roku Stick at http : //www.tomsguide.com/us/roku-hdmi-smart-tv-usb-netflix , news-13751.html Bob	Sug
1.5.1	I was just hoping there might be a cheap and simple piece of kit which might achieve what I 'm after .	St
1.5.2	I 've done some research and have n't found anything - hence my question .	St
1.5.3	I realise that if it ends up costing the same as a media streaming box then it would be pointless !	St
1.5.4	Has anyone found a set-up which does this simply and cheaply ?	Ques
1.6.1	I 've seen the older Roku refurbs on woot.com for 49 bucks .	St
1.6.2	But I had that and gave it to my brother and now have the Logitech Revue which is now 99 bucks .	St
1.6.3	There is a ZERO cost solution you may have already .	St
1.6.4	Hook up your PC to the TV and you are done .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	I suspect that might be the only realistic option !	St
1.8.1	There are 2 devices which do exactly what I 'm looking for : http : //hsti.com/wirelessmediastick/overview http : //www.infinitec.com/ The first is reported to be the better device , and they 're not that cheap so it 's questionable whether these would be worth the money over a network/DNLA type media player .	St
1.9.1	And less capable .	St
1.9.2	Good luck and tell us how it turns out .	Polite
1.10.1	http : //hsti.com/moboplay Today it looks like you can get both units for 89.95 .	St
