1.1.1	I was given a HP Pavilion that has the network card on the mb.	St
1.1.2	I replaced the card with a Netgear FA 311 PCI adapter when the original decided it had worked long enough.	St
1.1.3	However, I can't get the computer to recognize the new card.	St
1.1.4	I have tried uninstalling and disabling the old card but I get a &quot;Code 10&quot; error message - whatever that means.	St
1.1.5	Do I need to get into the bios to change stuff and if so how do I do that?	St
1.1.6	I have Windows XP but I don't know the model number of the computer; it's not anywhere on the case.	St
1.1.7	HP support told me to contact Netgear and Netgear doesn't seem to know what I'm talking about.	St
1.1.8	I appreciate your help; the kids are driving me nuts with only one computer connected to the Web.	Polite
1.1.9	(Talk about spoiled!	St
1.1.10	When I was a kid computers were made out of rocks and you had to use your feet to stop the car.)	St
1.1.11	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	What you didn't write in your post is if you installed a driver for said card.	Polite
1.2.2	A clue is this user's review: &quot;Easier install driver than the Netgear 311 but..., Netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 (they send me the 311 driver disk).	St
1.2.3	I figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption.	St
1.2.4	After wasting sometime with the wrong driver I got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there.	St
1.2.5	It works very well..	St
1.2.6	I just wish Netgear was a little more careful&quot; They had some 311's too and noted difficulty with the driver install.	St
1.2.7	In closing, I think something fishy is going on here and I'd just get another card.	St
1.2.8	Why?	St
1.2.9	Look over http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_dnld.asp?prodNum=FA311 and if you download documentation and files, the latest date I see is 2001.	St
1.2.10	This is years before Windows XP, so it may be just a bum card?	St
1.2.11	Try another make/model.	St
1.2.12	Or at least another slot... Bob Bob	St
1.3.1	If you haven't already go to HP's web site, go to the knowledgebase and do a search on the &quot;Code 10&quot; error message.	St
1.3.2	Try pressing the Delete or ctrl or f10 key during the power-on, but before windows starts to load, that should get you into the bios.	St
1.3.3	Good Luck Ciao.	St
