<s> I have just got my hands on a secondhand Dell model No DHM and the hard drive is scrubed. </s>
<s> Now I cant get it to load I dont get any thing at all and I dont have any discs with it could any one advise what to use. </s>
<s> Not all dells came with Windows so there is no automatic right to run that. </s>
<s> Maybe you just need to use it for the web, word processing and such? </s>
<s> May I suggest you try PCLinuxOS and Ubuntu which are popular and free, easy to install CDs. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob the PC is licencde for 2000 pro but I cant get the basic startup prompts I wonder if I could dowload some form of a boot disc </s>
<s> If you can't boot that, there are problems with the machine or you forgot to set the CD as the boot device. </s>
<s> http://www.bootdisk.com has... boot disks. </s>
<s> I'm unsure what good they will do without an OS CD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I will try that site thanks for your help </s>
