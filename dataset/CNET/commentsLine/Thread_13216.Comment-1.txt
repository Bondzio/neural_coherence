im trying to upgrade my dell inspiron 546 due to lack of funds to build a new rig.
i have bought graphics cards in past, but ive never bought a psu or put in a psu before, but i am sure, with guidance i could certainly do it.
i want to make sure these parts will actually work with my inspiron before i buy them so thats why i am posting here today.
psu:  vid card:  i know that the current graphics card i have in now is a 220 gt and its worth about 30 dollars and its pretty old along with my computer.
so i dont know if this new card would even work with my mobo or anything and i also dont know if the psu would fit in my tower ( its not a slim so it should? )
