Speaking with XFX, they said do not use the nvrotate utility.
That only rotates the primary monitor.
Instead, using the classic nvidia control panel (not the new one), go into nview, click display settings, highlight the monitor you want to rotate, right click, then rotate.
They tested that in house and said it worked.
