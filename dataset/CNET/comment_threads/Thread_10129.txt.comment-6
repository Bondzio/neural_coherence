&quot;How to install the DVD player (for Windows 98) Windows 98 has an internal DVD player, but it isn't installed during Windows setup.
You must extract &quot;manually&quot; DVD player files from cab sources.
Those files are dvdplay.chm, dvdplay.cnt, dvdplay.hlp, dvdplay.exe and dvdrgn.exe.
Put them into a folder of your choice, and them move dvdrgn.exe into Windows folder.
Run dvdplay.exe to start the player.
&quot; - Noted widely on the web.
But this player is incapable of playing 99% of commercial DVDs.
I've found this tip to be useful for playback in a pinch for homemade DVDs.
