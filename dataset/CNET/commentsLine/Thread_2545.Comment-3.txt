well i was playing a game when the computer shut off earlier that day.
when it shut off the power would turn on and off really quick so i decided to unplug it.
the fan from the power supply was making a real loud noise for the past few days proior to it crashing.
so i thought it was the power supply, so i ship a new tower with a 450 wat power supply, and had it tested before it got shiped.
i put the computer together correctly (checked at least 20 times to make sure).
the computer turned on but the monitor didnt and keyboard flashes, like before.
