1.1.1	I'm trying to extend my wifi.	St
1.1.2	I read lots of articles.	St
1.1.3	But I can't the repeater to work.	St
1.1.4	Here's my setup.	St
1.1.5	A PC downstairs, hard wired to a Wi-Fi modem/router.	St
1.1.6	I got a new PC for upstairs.	St
1.1.7	The main router is a Actiontec m1424wr rev 1.	St
1.1.8	The usb adaptor for the PC upstairs is a netgear n150 wna1100.	St
1.1.9	A Netgear n150 wnr1000 Wi-Fi router is going to be the repeater.	St
1.1.10	Instead of running 50 feet of cable, I decided to do it wireless.	St
1.1.11	The new PC is getting 65Mbps.	St
1.1.12	My tablet, when I use it upstairs.	St
1.1.13	I get anywhere between 5-65 Mbps.	St
1.1.14	When I use the tablet downstairs, I get 65Mbps.	St
1.1.15	But on the tablet, I get lots of signal dropping when I'm upstairs.	St
1.1.16	But not downstairs.	St
1.1.17	So I want to use a repeater.	St
1.1.18	Here's how I sat it up, which did not work.	St
1.1.19	The actiontech ip pool I 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.254 1.	St
1.1.20	The router actiontech ip is 192.168.1.1 2.	St
1.1.21	I changed the netgear to 192.168.1.50 3.	St
1.1.22	I turn off DHCP on the netgear.	St
1.1.23	4.	St
1.1.24	In order to set the gateway.	St
1.1.25	I had to use a static ip.	St
1.1.26	So I used 192.168.1.50, that would be the netgear new ip anyway.	St
1.1.27	5.	St
1.1.28	Then I had to set the subnet.	St
1.1.29	So I did 255.255.255.0, the same as the router.	St
1.1.30	6 .	St
1.1.31	It asked for the mac of the main router.	St
1.1.32	I put that in.	St
1.1.33	7.	St
1.1.34	Then I did the gateway.	St
1.1.35	The same as the actiontech 192.168.1.1 8.	St
1.1.36	Then I had to manually put in the DNS settings.	St
1.1.37	It wouldn't automatically get it.	St
1.2.1	If you want to try repeaters, try a few but be sure you can return them but my fix time after time to use the router as a WAP.	St
1.2.2	Even if I can't get the WAP too far away from the router it often helps.	St
1.2.3	How did you address channels?	Ques
1.2.4	With 802.11n 40MHz ODFM you get 1 channel so did you pull that back to 20?	St
1.2.5	More at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels Bob	St
1.3.1	&quot; With 802.11n 40MHz ODFM you get 1 channel so did you pull that back to 20?&quot; I have no idea what that means.	St
1.3.2	The actiontech I put on channel, netgear channel 6.	St
1.3.3	I'm just going to wire the two routers, and put the netgear upstairs, Cause right now.	St
1.3.4	I'm downloaded about 25 videos, altogether it comes out to about 3GB.	St
1.3.5	2 hours later, it's still downloading.	St
1.3.6	Every store around me, they want $30 and up for a 50 foot cable.	St
1.3.7	What kind of cable would I need?	St
1.3.8	I've seen cross over, straight through, patch cables.	St
1.3.9	Which kind of devices are used for each kind of those cables?	St
1.3.10	Now I can use the same SSID as downstairs.	St
1.3.11	And roam seamlessy with my tablet.	Sug
1.3.12	And what, if any settings would I have to change.	St
1.3.13	Besides the routers IP.	St
1.3.14	Also going through the netgear, can I still access my actiontech?	St
1.3.15	I know I have to change the netgear ip, I'll just change that to 192.168.1.2 And turn off DNS.	St
1.3.16	That's it.	St
1.3.17	Or do I have to do something else?	Ques
1.3.18	I can also use wpa2?	St
1.3.19	When I'm using that wireless connection.	St
1.3.20	How does that work?	St
1.3.21	It it just sending the signal from my tablet, to the netgear.	St
1.3.22	Then that signal send it down the wire to the actiontech?	St
1.3.23	Or is it going from the tablet, to the netgear wifi, then to the actiontech?	St
1.3.24	Another thing.	St
1.3.25	Why when I replied to your question, it was asking for a subject title?	St
1.3.26	I'm posting in the same thread.	St
1.4.1	So you could read why I wrote that.	Sug
1.4.2	This idea of seamless roaming is junk.	St
1.4.3	I've yet to see it work for example, watching some netflix and roam to another hotspot.	St
1.4.4	It drops dead.	St
1.4.5	About the subject title, it's required but do we want to discuss forum nuances or router setups?	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Cat5e-Ethernet-Patch-Meters/dp/B001TH7GVO	St
1.6.1	The subject line was just a question that had nothing to do with my main question.	St
1.6.2	But what do I need to change in the Netgear router.	St
1.6.3	I know the wireless won't be that seamless, but if the ssid's are the same.	St
1.6.4	Won't it just look like one network for the wireless.	St
1.7.1	No.	St
1.7.2	So I never bother to make the SSIDs match.	St
1.7.3	That way I know which point it connected to.	St
1.7.4	If you setup this as the more common router as a WAP then it's still one WLAN and LAN.	St
1.7.5	That's what most folk want.	St
1.7.6	Since I never found the repeater mode to be reliable I don't deploy such.	St
1.7.7	I find it best to let others do that so the clients flame them instead of me.	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	The words Router As A WAP on google finds the usual setup I use.	St
1.8.2	I don't write how here because I find some folk can't take my explanation and since members can find the article that makes sense to them, I offer the words for google instead.	St
1.9.1	I just paid $7.04 for a straight through 50 foot Cat 5 cable from a company in Chesterfield Missouri.	St
1.9.2	Wish I could remember the name.	St
1.9.3	I can post it when the cable gets here.	St
1.9.4	It's not another Amazon or EBay, or Walmart.	St
1.9.5	They actually make cable.	St
