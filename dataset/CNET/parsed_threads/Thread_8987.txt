<s> I inserted the card in my PCMCIA slot, but no hardware wizard came up, and the light isn't blinking. </s>
<s> Is there a problem with the driver, or the card, or the PCMCIA slot itself? </s>
<s> From an OS that someone installed and forgot drivers to a bum port or cards. </s>
<s> The story here is too light to point to any but the usuals. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is there any way to fix it? </s>
<s> The driver is a Texas Instruments PCI-1410 Cardbus controller, and I have the newest version installed. </s>
<s> I am working on an Acer Aspire 3003WLCi laptop with a 1.8 ghz AMD Mobile Sempron processor, and I'm looking to connect a Canon Elura 100 camcorder. </s>
<s> I hope this helps! </s>
<s> I dropped the hint about the OS install. </s>
<s> Is it stock or did someone install XP? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's a stock install. </s>
<s> All the drivers should be there, because I recently had problems and used my restore discs. </s>
<s> Some Dell's require more than what drivers they supplied. </s>
<s> Not only the PC-Card chipset driver but a motherboard driver package. </s>
<s> We also can't tell if the card is dead or not. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm running on an Acer Aspire 3003WLCi laptop. </s>
<s> Like I said, when I tried to update the driver, it said I have the newest version. </s>
<s> I tried also to download some drivers from TechGear's website, but I don't think that they were to run the device, they were just add-ons for more features. </s>
<s> You write &quot;stock install.&quot; But one owner had installed &quot;XP&quot; from a retail CD and called that a stock install. </s>
<s> Is this laptop ever had the OS reinstalled? </s>
<s> By who? </s>
<s> How? </s>
<s> If Acer's install then I'm calling the card dead or incompatible. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Acer had XP installed when I bought the laptop last year. </s>
<s> The only &quot;reinstallation&quot; was when I used the restore discs from Acer that came with it. </s>
<s> Exchange it for another make. </s>
