<s> Hello I've been looking around for a TV tuner that can broadcast my TV at home back to me away from home. </s>
<s> So far I've only been able to find the Slingbox as a viable option. </s>
<s> Are there any other types of this kind of device similar to the Slingbox? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance - Nick </s>
<s> you could home-brew your own, but slingbox does all the work for you. </s>
<s> unless you're a hobbyist, go with slingbox or get something to convert your programs to divx and burn them to cd/dvd. </s>
<s> a single layer dvd can hold 12+ hours of divx high-res video. </s>
<s> Something sort of like SageTV? </s>
