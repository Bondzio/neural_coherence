There seem to be 3 main compatable models; GSAS10N, UJ-857C, and UJ-867A. I know they must be capped at 8xDVD and I want Dual layer ability. The UJ867A by Panasonic seems to fit what I want. Here are my 2 ?s. 1. Is the Panasonic 867A (Nov 2010) 9.5mm the best choice? 2. SATA or PATA? I know SATA is a bit faster but is that what's in there already? The 2010 new Super i am looking at is PATA, is the current Optical a SATA? And should I just try to find a SATA UJ-857C in good shape? I know somewhere someone has already asked smthg similar but by page 20 and the CNet search yielded no answers. Thank You for any help!

I have watched about 6 videos and 30 sites including Amazon and EBay to view over 300 different drives dating from mid '07 to current. There are 3 (so far) types that claim to be OEM replacement Supers for the already installed Optical. Some claim the replacement is SATA and Some claim PATA all for the exact model I have. Removing the current drive and looking at what's in there is an option but the SATAs and PATAs both claim to offer the adapting cable to utilize the other format. I have been building and configuring computers for 22 years. From the old Pizza box desktops to UU19 racks and this is the craziest thing I've ever run accross. It's a A1181, Feb 2008, MB402LL/A, MacBook 4.1, Dual Core 2.1, currently running Snow Leopard. How hard should this be? All three types listed in my first post claim to be OEM. This is a crapshoot. If i can't get specific info to buy the drive (ranging from $25 to $200) I'm just going to throw a dart and see where it lands. Thanks for the response so far, I do appreciate it. I'm just frustrated.

It's the EIDE version of the 10N	Same version, the 10N, as a new EIDE on Amazon for $50 from Panasonic which claims to be OEM brand. There are 3 model types and two connectivity standards for the exact same model. I understand OEM can be several different companies due to supply chain issues. It's the 2 connectivity standards that claim to be original for the exact same model I question. Any thanks, I know Mercury. They are quality. Just twice the price. Thanks, cheers!
