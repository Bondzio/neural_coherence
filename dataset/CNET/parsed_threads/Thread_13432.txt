<s> Hello all, I'm relatively new here and this is my first post, so please forgive me for any newbie errors. </s>
<s> Anyway, I'm upgrading from an Athlon XP 1900 to an Athlon 64 3000. </s>
<s> I've bought a MB/CPU/RAM combo and it will be arriving Wednesday. </s>
<s> My question is this, when I go to install this new MB setup, can I just plug in my existing HDD's and keep going? </s>
<s> Or will doing so cause many many many many headaches that will make me go bananas? </s>
<s> If so, how do I circumvent this? </s>
<s> Also, if there is a webpage out there on the 'net that shows a step-by-step upgrade procedure such as this, would you mind pointing me in that direction? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Pedo... </s>
<s> Since no operating system (OS) is listed, I think it should just plug in and work. </s>
<s> If an OS is noted, then post this in an OS Forum. </s>

<s> I posted in the OS forum, but have yet to receive a response. </s>
