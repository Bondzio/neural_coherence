<s> I have just installed my motherboard (Elitegroup Ks57a( into a new case (Axio ATX 732 X5 Series) This case comes with two front USB ports as well as a headphone and mic jack. </s>
<s> I have hooked up the USB ports,(although one is current not working) but the headphone and mic jack setup is giving me problems. </s>
<s> I can't make heads nor tails of how to connect them to my motherboard. </s>
<s> I know they go to my FP_Audio but I don't know what connector goes to what pin because they are labled differently from one another. </s>
<s> This is my first time doing this by the way and I am just impressed that my machine is still working. </s>
<s> They pins on the ribbon for the headphone and jack from the case are: L-IN - White wire L-OUT - Red wire GRND - Black Mice - IN - Orange R-OUT - Red R-IN - White MIC - IN - Green GRND - BLK The confusing thing is the pins on the motherboard seem to be marked differently then what is in the manual. </s>
<s> But the pin setup is the same with 5pin on the left and a 3 blank 1 pin on the right. </s>
<s> If anyone can sort this out for me or point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. </s>

<s> See if the maker's web site has a newer manual and from experience, the marking on the motherboard is often correct. </s>
