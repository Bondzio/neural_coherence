I want to use it as a second hard drive to install Linux on it. Once I connected everything and I am starting my computer windows home edition doesn't boot. The Computer also doesn't see the new Hard Drive?? Bios: p4vma-m

Also, how do you plan on controlling which O/S will boot? Some people use utilities for this though I think one could use the BIOS settings to change this. Regards, JB

But when I installed the correct drivers, and set all the settings inside Bios every thing worked fine. I also had a second operating system on one off the 3 hard drives I have in my system. To get to my second hard drive with the XP on it or what ever, I had to go inside (Bios) and then inside off (Advanced Bios Features) and make a change from (HDD 0) To (SCSI)or HDD 1, HDD2, HDD3. Thats how you access your second operating system on your other hard drive. (A lot OFF Fun) Good Luck Wendell H

Inside Bios there is a settings that will set you back to Load fail-safe default settings or Load optimized default settings. You could try either one off them, and if that does not work you may have to reinstall windows. Good Luck Wendell H
