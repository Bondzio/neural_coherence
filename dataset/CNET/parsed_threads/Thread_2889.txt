<s> I just purchased an rca small wonder video cam, and while I love the cam..easy to use, etc...I have a prob. </s>
<s> When I play back the video I take, on the camera, it looks and sounds fine. </s>
<s> When I use the preinstalled software, and play it back, it plays at a really fast rate, and thus makes it sound like &quot;alvin and the chipmunks&quot; recorded it. </s>
<s> I even tried to upload the video to my computer without the built in software, and then play it in windows media player. </s>
<s> Same result. </s>
<s> I'm assuming it's a codec problem. </s>
<s> I tried everything I could think of removed my klite codec pack...and thus the ffdshow. </s>
<s> Ran a prog called Codec Sniper, and all is well there. </s>
<s> I just don't know what else to do (except to return the camera). </s>
<s> I did get my Kodak digital camera out, put it in video mode, and then played that back .....that played ok. Any ideas before I return the thing....I really wanted this camera. </s>
<s> Or should I return it and try a FlipVideo cam? </s>
<s> I liked the Small Wonder, due to the SD expansion slot. </s>
<s> Would love any and all feedback. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I've fixed this too many times to count. </s>
<s> I find and install the machine's latest audio driver. </s>
<s> Sadly you didn't tell what PC you have so I can't give you the link if there was one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> wow....a reply! </s>
<s> I posted this prob on 3 tech sites and you're the only one that replied. </s>
<s> What info do you need? </s>
<s> I've got a gateway, 510xl, Intel Pent. </s>
<s> 4, 3.00g, running xp/sp2, 2g ram, NVIDIA GEForce fx5200, Creative SB Audigy, SoundMax integrated digital audio let me know what else you need....I really want to keep this camera! </s>
<s> thanks so much, Janice </s>
<s> a while back I tried to update the drivers...followed directions, and looked at the version I had, on the device manager...went to gateway site. </s>
<s> The last update was 2003, and I installed it. </s>
<s> Just did it again, and it doesn't make a difference. </s>

<s> I keep reading about this, and from what I can tell, uninstalling and reinstalling my sound card driver, but I'm just not sure how to do that...(or confidant enuf) What do you think? </s>

<s> 510 XL Home Computer R1 - 2900034 </s>
<s> if you're getting this off the gateway site, I just went this route (no disrespect intended). </s>
<s> How do I find out this (latest) info you want? </s>
<s> creative sb audigy driver version 5.12.1.324 SoundMax Intergrated Digital Audio driver version 5.12.1.3571 that's been updated...same prob..what other info do you need. </s>
<s> I really want you to fix this prob for me... </s>
<s> just went thru the cd disks that came with my computer. </s>
<s> I've got one that says SoundBlaster Audigy Sound Card Driver and APPs...cd contains: SoundBlaster Audigy Windows xp drivers creative playcenter 3 creative audioHQ creative recorder creative wavestudio creative surround mixer creative restore defaults online manual and users guide </s>
<s> Sorry but that's not possible. </s>
<s> I can't come there to do that. </s>
<s> I will however share I've cured the chipmunk playback with installing the latest motherboard and audio drivers. </s>
<s> There are NO buttons in Windows we use to get drivers. </s>
<s> So we have to do this the old fashioned way. </s>
<s> -&gt; THANK YOU for digging up the model and part names since I can't be exact without them. </s>
<s> Here we go. </s>
<s> Rather than try just the audo drivers, let's just do all the drivers I would. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Motherboard chipset drivers are at http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 I'd use item 2. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Audio drivers are at THIS LINK Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> I tried audio drivers first. </s>
<s> Followed directions, rebooted, and I had no sound. </s>
<s> So I reverted my drive back to when I did have sound. </s>
<s> I just am at a loss.....and I know if I return this rca small wonder, and get the flip video, i'm gonna have the same prob. </s>
<s> We may have got the wrong audio card. </s>
<s> There are no less than three Audigy's. </s>
<s> OK, the motherboard supplies the clocks for the audio playback so if that didn't help we are still looking at the usual cause. </s>
<s> -&gt; Another fine mess in audio loss after the driver are the volume settings and the SPEAKER settings. </s>
<s> Did you check those after the driver install? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, I did. </s>
<s> So, I got out the install cd, reinstalled the SoundBlaster Audio. </s>
<s> After install, I got a window that said a file was missing (ctdvda2k.sys), did a search on the cd, and found it, and now I'm ok. </s>
<s> I have sound. </s>
<s> All music plays ok in WMP...my other videos play ok...but anything I upload from this RCA cam plays in fast forward and alvin and the chipmunks sing to me. </s>
<s> This just sucks.... any other ideas? </s>
<s> I do really appreciate your time and help </s>
<s> I tried but looks like I missed which Audigy they used. </s>
<s> The TREMOR was another model so use that driver and retest. </s>
<s> If you didn't install the other driver then you may have passed up another issue and fix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> for the most part, I'm back in business. </s>
<s> I (somehow) disabled the internal software of the rca camera, and now just plug it in, and access it thru &quot;my computer&quot; as another drive, view the avi files, and then drag them into another folder. </s>
<s> I can successfully view and listen to them in VLC media player. </s>
<s> I cannot, though, view them correctly thru Windows Media Player or Real Player. </s>
<s> But, VLC is a stable player, and now I don't have to mess around with that cheesy software that was in the camera. </s>
<s> I appreciate all the help. </s>
<s> Now....help me with my sound card update, which I posted in the appropriate forum. </s>
<s> As for Windows Media Player, after doing very exhaustive research, seems alot of folks have the same problem. </s>
<s> Alvin and the Chipmunks way too fast audio. </s>
<s> Some get it fixed with adjusting the acceleration. </s>
<s> That didn't help in my case. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Janice </s>
