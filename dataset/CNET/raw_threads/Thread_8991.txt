I bought this laptop used for school and it seem to work well except for the wireless. I can't seem to bring the icons up or tell if it's working. I went to Thinkpads (Leveno) website and downloaded all the drivers I thought I might need, no luck. I do have a yellow question mark next to my network controller in my Device Manager could this be the problem. It has a Intel 3B2100 802.11b wireless card installed. I do not have a start up disc. Any help on this would be appreciated

My guess is that one directly from Intel will work as these tend to cover several models.

The CHIPSET driver (not the wifi card!!!) 3. MS UAA (see google.) 4. The audo driver. 5. The video driver. 6. The ethernet driver. 7. The wifi driver. 8. The ACCESSORIES driver (I know that's vague) but this one is the one that turns on or off the wifi. I can't guess which one it was, you tell me.

I did download the driver from Intl for the wireless card, like Steve said, and it seem to do the trick. The yellow question mark is gone, replaced by a Intel PRO wireless adapter. It is now able to see my wireless connection and lets me in, but now it can't seem to aquire a IP address. Do you know what I need to do for this.

Make sure your Windows wireless zero service is set to automatic as well.
11166	8	368021	3171844	3171698	R. Proffitt	11/11/09 3:53 AM	1.25791158E12	About the address.	The repeating cause is WEP. It does that if one character is off in the password. This is one reason among the security issue with WEP I move to WPA. And in this forum is our preferred router wifi settings. Share those. Also, be careful not to have 2 wifi managers. My old laptop was loaned out and somehow they turned on the second wifi connection manager. Sorry, no but I can't recall or know all the methods to get this back to just one. But I'm leaning to always using the Windows Wireless Zero Configuration tool for all machines. Bob

11166	13	368021	3176684	3176225	Coryphaeus	11/17/09 5:53 AM	1.25843718E12	What I meant to say is . . .	SP3 supports WPA if the router has it. If the router transmits WPA then Windows will encode/decode WPA. You have to tell the router which encryption to use.
