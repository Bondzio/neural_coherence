<s> Total networking newbie here. </s>
<s> That aside; I have a My Book 2TB World Edition II which I purchased for basically music, videos and pics only. </s>
<s> I purchased this one specifically as it said that it would stream videos to my PS3 (and I gotta smokin deal on it). </s>
<s> I've read that I'll need to format it to FAT32 (whatever that is) for the PS3 to recognize it. </s>
<s> I also want to be able to stream stuff to my laptop wirelessly too. </s>
<s> I also don't have high speed internet as it's so expensive where I live (dsl and cable internet not available here) if that matters. </s>
<s> What I need is a good/fast router that won't bottleneck when I'm tryin to wirelessly stream to my ps3 (via dlna, whatever that is) and to my laptop. </s>
<s> It would also be nice, but not necessary, that it be easy to setup. </s>
<s> Also, once the NAS is set to FAT32, will my laptop be able to read it too? </s>
<s> I basically am turning the NAS into a media station for all my media needs; just accessed wirelessly....tips, tricks, tips??? </s>
<s> Oh yeah, the router will probably be in the same room as the PS3 and one room and wall away from my laptop....until we move, hahaha. </s>
<s> Any opinions on good routers for this application? </s>
<s> Anyone already doing this with their PS3???? </s>
<s> Laptop is an Aspire 5315-2153 on Vista Basic Intel Celeron processor 530 1.73 GHz, 533 MHz, 1MB L2 Cache Up to 252MB Mobile Intel GraphicsMedia Accelerator X3100 1GB DDR2 802.11b/g WLAN PS3 is 80gig fat NAS is 2TB My Book World Edition II </s>
<s> All the NAS I used from my PCs or 360 didn't care what the underlying file system was. </s>
<s> The file on the NAS was sent over and the PC/360 just can't know if it's on a FAT or other file system. </s>
<s> So if your unit is the unit at http://www.legitreviews.com/article/998/1/ can you reveal why you would change the file system? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yeah, that's the NAS I'll be using. </s>
<s> I have to make it a FAT32 as the PS3 won't recognize otherwise. </s>
<s> It kinda sucks though as I'll be limited to 4 gigs per file (at least that's what I read about FAT32's). </s>
<s> I've heard of making USB drives FAT32 but never when it was on a NAS. </s>
<s> Can you ask whoever is telling you this? </s>
<s> Something's not right. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I read it over on some of the PS3 forums....maybe I'm mistaken; I'll have to search or post a question over there. </s>
<s> My brain is fried from hours of searching to make sure I get a good/the right router. </s>
<s> USB drive direct connect to PS3 = FAT32. </s>
<s> NAS drive over a network = You can use any file system. </s>
<s> Hope that clears it up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ...now I just need to find a good/fast router that doesn't take a degree in computer science to setup, haha. </s>
<s> I have the usual Netgear units like this WRN2000 and have some other 3500 I'll replace it with next month. </s>
<s> The trouble is here that I might know too much. </s>
<s> What can stop a person cold is not an issue for me. </s>
<s> If I see an option I may try it and learn from the experiences. </s>
<s> Others want to read a document or a &quot;step by step.&quot; I used that RESET BUTTON on the router a few times as I tried it all. </s>
