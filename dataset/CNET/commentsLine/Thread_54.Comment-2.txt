hello jconner, is your dell still under warranty, if so you might have to get a replacement ps from dell to keep your warranty in effect.
if you decide to replace your dell ps, i think pc power and cooling makes dell replacement power supplies.
their stuff is excellent i have used it before with excellent results.
i have total faith in that company and no i do not work for them.
they are in calif. and i am near cleveland, ohio.
their power supplies are also very quiet.
remember to consider getting a larger ps than the one you are replacing, for future expansion.
my dell dimension 8100 has a 330watt ps.
i prefer not to go lower than that size ps.
