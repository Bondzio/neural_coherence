this may sound strange but i have seen similar situations with hp printers when cartridges are changed, generally with all-in one units.
try reloading the software, uninstall then reinstall, if that doesn't do the trick then go to the hp site and see if there is an update for that unit.
where issues arose, some years back, was the transition from win xp to vista and now of course win 7. the d7160 is not a new unit and as i recall had software bundled compatible with win xp, so unless you have done an update and are running against vista or win 7 you may have some issues.
