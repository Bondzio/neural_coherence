hi, i'm working on trying to get a system put together for a specific set of uses, and i'm curious if anyone would be willing to take the time to assist me in picking out a decent set of parts to go with for it.
what follows is my basic spec of what i need.
i'm trying to put together the best system i can for the least amount of cost, as the system will be used primarily for multi-media, dvd playing, etc.
1. micro atx size case(desktop style - that lays flat instead of standing upright).
2. sound card that fully supports dolby 5.1/dts 5.1 audio, w/ analog or digital outs that can easily connect to a home theatre reciever.
3.
10/100 fast ethernet port or card 4.
3.5&quot; floppy drive 5.
16x dvd-rom that fully supports reading dvd-r/dvd+r dvd-rw/dvd+rw recorded disks.
6.
256mb or 512mb of ddr value priced ram.
7.
64mb(approximately) video memory with decent quality svideo out.
8.
60gb or larger 7200rpm ata 100 or 133 hard drive 9.
1.5ghz or faster processor(that handles modern multi media uses).
overall, i'm looking for the best system i can put together that is like this description given.
i.e.
a system that will give the best performance/speed for the least amount of cost.
it will not be used for high end games or intensive business applications.
its primary use will be for serving dvd content, mp3 audio and emulated games.
any assistance with suggestions on parts for such a system would be greatly appreciated.
i look forward to hearing from people.
thanks for your time!
