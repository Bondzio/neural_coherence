<s> Hi, I have Roadrunner and voip with Nuvio, and a router with three network locations, when I add a Linksys wrt160n wireless router it does 130mbs but when I use the phone it drops to 54mbs. </s>
<s> Is this normal? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I assume you are using a wireless voip phone? </s>
<s> It is not so much the voip as how wireless works when running a mix of devices. </s>
<s> I suspect your phone is 802.11g 130m is using a wide band 802.11N and 54 is using 802.11G. </s>
<s> First a router will always slow down to talk to a slower device. </s>
<s> It will attempt to switch back and forth but many times it will just run slower for all devices. </s>
<s> If you use a old 802.11b device you many times in effect force all your newer devices to run slower. </s>
<s> The other thing that 802.11n with wide channels does it will go to narrow channels ie 65/72m if it detect another device trying to use a adjacent channel. </s>
<s> So if it detects your neighbor it will change. </s>
<s> Many people disable this feature. </s>
<s> In your case I suspect since you say it is 54m which is 802.11g you have a device active at that speed. </s>
<s> Hey thanks, I guess that makes some sense, I have an old 2.4GHz Uniden portable that I use, and I have my house hard-wired with cat6 cable and just stuck the wireless router at a wall terminal. </s>
<s> I guess that I need to incorporate it into my system but I think I'm getting rid of Roadrunner soon, so just didn't want to hassle with it. </s>
<s> It works fine if I just stay off of the phone........ </s>
