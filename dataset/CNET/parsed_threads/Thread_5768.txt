<s> Systemax Systems AMD Athlon (tm) Processor 1.00 GHz, 512 MB RAM Windows XP Home version 2002 service pack 2 Last week my cdrw drive was left open and someone broke it with their knee. </s>
<s> I went out and bought a new internal drive for $34 called &quot;I/O Magic&quot;. </s>
<s> The instructions say the drivers will be installed when I reboot, no software disc needed. </s>
<s> I removed the broken drive (taking photos of every move I made and I marked all 3 cables needed). </s>
<s> I then installed the new drive. </s>
<s> It opened and closed and the light came on. </s>
<s> I then went to &quot;My Computer&quot; and the drive was not there. </s>
<s> I put an audio disc in to see if it played and it didn't. </s>
<s> I then went to I/O magics website and by it's appearance, I didn't expect much. </s>
<s> I found drivers for this drive, downloaded and nothing. </s>
<s> They recomended I restart in safe mode and it wouldn't. </s>
<s> I removed he new drive and am now wondering if there's something I missed or shold have tried. </s>
<s> Any and all suggestions are appreciated. </s>
<s> No drivers required for that drive in XP. </s>
<s> How is the drive jumpered? </s>
<s> Try Cable Select (CS) and then reboot. </s>
<s> Result? </s>
<s> How do I &quot;try Cable Select&quot; ? </s>
<s> Is that in the BIOS setup? </s>
<s> This is new territory for me. </s>
<s> I reattached the same cables used in the broken drive. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> I forgot to mention that my DVD drive did not appear either when I opened control panel. </s>
<s> After removing the new CDRW it does appear. </s>
<s> Tune-up: How to install a DVD or CD burner &quot;Step 3&quot; describes the jumpering. </s>
<s> I got my cdrw working thanks to your detailed instructions. </s>
<s> The email I recieved did not show your email. </s>
<s> Now I can back up my work..... again thank you, thank you, thank you!!! </s>
