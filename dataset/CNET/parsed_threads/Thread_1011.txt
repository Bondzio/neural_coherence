<s> I purchased a Seagate Desktop a few months ago to back up my hard drive every night. </s>
<s> My hard drive is almost maxed out and I need more storage. </s>
<s> Can I permanently store and access all my data (mostly pics and videos that are taking up too much space) on the back up drive or is it solely for backing data up? </s>
<s> I tried moving some data to the external back up drive but after a week or so, it disappeared from there because I guess it wasn't on my hard drive (so when it backed up my hard drive, it eventually deleted it). </s>
<s> I didn't want to have to buy a whole new computer, nor did I want to get another external storage device. </s>
<s> Can I use this to hold all my data to free up my hard drive, but still access it as another drive/folder? </s>
<s> some of the many posts of those who have lost some or all of their data stored on external hard drives. </s>
<s> Hope you fair better. </s>
