1.1.2	Thanks very much	Polite
1.2.1	i believe nVidia is currently slightly ahead of ATI in the graphics department at the moment.	St
1.3.1	I haven't seen the 8300 benchtested.	St
1.3.2	Toms hardware tested the HD2400 Pro, and rank it a couple notches higher than the 8400 GS, and just a notch below the 8500 GT.	St
1.3.3	They're both mid/low range graphics cards, good for basic use + light gaming.	St
