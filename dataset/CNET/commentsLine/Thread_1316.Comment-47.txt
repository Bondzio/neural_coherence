my desktop computer is connected to my stereo system and television allowing me to stream all of my media to watch/listen to on the system.
my sound card is capable of supporting 5.1 channel surround sound which isn't bad, although it can be better.
the other two desktops in the household are all in the same network enabling me to stream media to and from them as well.
one problem with my setup however, i lack an hd tv.
sadly i'm still using a standard depth television, so is my sister.
my dad has a monster television of 61 inches, a projection television which also lacks hd capability.
(he got it just before hd was available in projection tv's at a reasonable price.)
my laptop i can easily connect to my media center either directly to the units or through my desktop at any time i wish.
having a large hdd and access to more hdd's throughout the house makes this setup practical for me and saves space in the house.
