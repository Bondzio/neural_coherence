<s> I'm having an issue with my network adapter. </s>
<s> My daughter was surfing the web when she says the internet stopped. </s>
<s> I looked and the network adapter is not picking up the network from a router two feet away. </s>
<s> The wireless network is working fine - I can connect with the other three devices in the house. </s>
<s> But this CPU will not recognize the network. </s>
<s> I have updated the device drivers for the adapter and run a basic Windows diagnosis - it says the drivers are up to date and the device is operating properly. </s>
<s> I have also run anti-virus software just in case she picked up something while browsing. </s>
<s> What am I missing? </s>
<s> but i can't connect to the internet...it's weird. </s>
<s> what is the problem?? </s>
<s> if anyone knows..help me plz </s>
<s> You said the wireless network is fine so shall we presume this one is wired? </s>
<s> If so, how far from the device is from the router doesn't much matter. </s>
<s> If wired, have you tried to ping the gateway? </s>
<s> If not, you could try that but first check to see if you have a proper IP address. </s>
<s> If using Windows, you type &quot;ipconfig&quot; (without quotes) from the command prompt. </s>
<s> It should show several sets of numbers. </s>
<s> One will be the gateway address and another will be the IP address of the network adapter(s). </s>
<s> If ping returns and error, the easiest thing to do would be the try a new cable. </s>
<s> See what more information you can provide and post back. </s>
<s> What exactly does the computer show or say? </s>
<s> My guess is that there is some basic physical connection to a wireless router but that it shows as &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;. </s>
<s> Limited connectivity means that it's not the full connectivity needed to go through the router to the public internet. </s>
<s> Usually this means that the PC didn't get it's IP-address from the router for some reason. </s>
<s> And that reason usually is some error in the configuration of either the PC or the router. </s>
<s> That's not weird, because it's a rather comples area as soon as something is wrong. </s>
<s> But there might be other causes. </s>
<s> For example, the ISP might have shut down the connection because you didn't pay. </s>
<s> Or the cable outside your house is damaged. </s>
<s> I've seen many people without Internet for a month or more, while the ISP tried to fix what was broken with them, especially if they had accepted an offer like &quot;Make your internet faster. </s>
<s> Add interactive TV. </s>
<s> Add VOIP. </s>
<s> Save money. </s>
<s> Excellent service. </s>
<s> Highly capable techs. </s>
<s> Sign here and enjoy next week&quot;. </s>
<s> - Please tell more about your connection (wired, wireless?). </s>
<s> - Did it ever work? </s>
<s> - If wireless, does it work wired? </s>
<s> - Does it work elsewhere (if wireless and a laptop)? </s>
<s> - Does another PC or laptop work with you? </s>
<s> - Finally, run ipconfig /all from the command prompt and post the full output in your answer. </s>

<s> No, this adapter is a wireless adapter card installed on a desktop CPU. </s>
<s> I am currently trying to bridge a connection from the laptop via USB to see if maybe the card is damaged? </s>
<s> We know Norton can do this when it expires. </s>
<s> There are some models of laptops that do this too often. </s>
<s> And some laptops have a wifi on/off feature/button. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
