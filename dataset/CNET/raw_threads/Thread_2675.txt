And I'm not sure how much ram it can hold and if it takes DDR, DRR2, DDR3, ram because i am looking at buying a 8GB of ram that is DDR3 and i want to make sure its the right kind before i buy it and the other thing is that if i can put a Intel core i7 with 3.40GHz and with a Intel HD Graphics 4000 go into the motherboard or do I need to upgrade the motherboard. So please answer these questions I really need the info.

If you change the mobo to accept an I7 your Dell OS will no longer function. That means you get to go buy a new copy of Windows.
