<s> I'd hate to think they were intentional, but my suspicions have been aroused. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a Seagate internal Ultra ATA/100 200-GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Installed in my system were two identical Maxtor Diamondback Plus 9 160-GB ATA/133. </s>
<s> Copying the contents of my master to the Seagate, I booted up. </s>
<s> That's when I got the POST message &quot;no 80-pin conductor cable installed.&quot; I tried both Maxtor drives as slaves with the same result. </s>
<s> I changed the pin settings from CS to slave with the same result. </s>
<s> Only when I put the two Maxtor drives together again did the drives work. </s>
<s> Is this mere coincidence or is there a bug in one of the drivers or controllers? </s>
<s> I also tried three different 80-pin connectors with the same results. </s>
<s> No way can I get the Seagate and Maxtor drives to work together. </s>
<s> I've got some data I'd very much like to get from one drive to the other, but I'm stumped. </s>
<s> I've used Maxtor drives for years with no problems, so naturally I'm suspicious about Seagate. </s>
<s> Any ideas of what may be wrong? </s>
<s> Are you trying to copy the entire drive or just some selected data ? </s>
<s> What mode is the controller set to ? </s>
<s> Tried any other controller modes ? </s>
<s> RE: Seagate and Maxtor...never heard of any incompatability issues. </s>
<s> Download SEATOOLS from Seagate.com to create an image of your old boot drive on the new boot drive. </s>
<s> That was my question also, that sounds like a copy issue to me, and not a compatibility problem. </s>
<s> I have a Seagate and a Maxtor on the same channel in my system with absolutely no problems. </s>
<s> I would definitely try the Seatools app works very well. </s>
<s> Thank you for your replies, but I'm starting to see the error message now even when I boot up using only the Seagate drive. </s>
<s> The drive still boots into Windows properly, though. </s>
<s> I bought a WD SATA 250 GB drive today and can't get my system to boot when the SATA drive is connected. </s>
<s> My system sees the new disk, but won't boot up with my the IDE drive. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to think I've got a MB problem. </s>
<s> I don't know enough about SATA drives to know what I'm doing, but the manual doesn't help. </s>
<s> It indicates that with both drives connected, I should be able to boot off their CD. </s>
<s> But I can't boot from the CD or the diskette the CD made. </s>
<s> It's going to be one of those weeks. </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions, I'll check back. </s>
<s> Thanks, again. </s>
