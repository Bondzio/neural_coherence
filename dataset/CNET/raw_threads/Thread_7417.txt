14784	0	326110	2956931	NR	Cycleman	1/19/09 12:34 PM	1.23236844E12	eSATA PCI card	My machine (HP 9340, Vista 64-bit, home premium) has one empty PCI slot. I have several external drives that have both a USB and eSATA input connector. I've seen eSATA PCI cards with 4 eSATA ports. Will I see better performance on transfer speeds between drives and the computer, if I install such a card? That is, with all four ports connected to drives, and running? Thanks. Al

If I put a 1 port eSATA to this, would a 1-in, 5-out eSATA hub work to give me more outlets and still provide the faster transfer speeds?

Before spending $100 on an eSATA HUB, I'd try it direct with the device suggested and check the results. Next I'd look at all the alternatives to see if that's truly the best approach to my storage and backup requirements. With the multitude of problems I see with externals ... I much prefer to utilize internals where possible. Keep us posted on the outcome. VAPCMD
