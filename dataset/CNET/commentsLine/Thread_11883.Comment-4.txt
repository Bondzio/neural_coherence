bob, i connected thru processmon and saw where they are saved.
toshiba establish a stack and save those variable there.
also it refers to a log file but i did not see its content change.
could you guide me how can i read and change these information?
by windows explorer i can go up to a directory that has log file, but i cannot see the stack, however thru processmonitor there are three level deeper directory as well.
