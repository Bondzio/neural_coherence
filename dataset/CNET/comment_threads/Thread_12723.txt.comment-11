over at http://www.FrostyTech.com....they 've go great info about the HS fans especially thermal transfer and noise.
From there ...you can go to your favorite source, buy it and install it.
Take a look at those made by Xigmatek ....they've got some decent HS Fans at reasonable prices ... but it's good to get the bracket kit to avoid the mounting problem.
Keep us posted.
