The details are sparse about your issue.
Since this is the hardware forum I would expect to see the hardware details, maybe some words about the machine's age, the exact version of the Microsoft CD and so on.
As it stands I would have to ask for all that.
Remember this are all volunteer forums so you have to do the best you can at making your best post.
