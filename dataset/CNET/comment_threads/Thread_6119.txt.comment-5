It's refurbished (joy systems) - so I'm not sure that the components are original - it could actually be 'rebuilt' - with some other components but this was the description: Lenovo IBM ThinkCentre M55e Desktop PC - Intel Dual-Core 1.6GHz, 2GB DDR2, 80GB HDD, DVD-ROM, Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit, Also - won't buy from newegg anymore - nothing but headaches with UPS lost shipment .
