i got a t6212 in may from emachines....upgraded the ram to 1.5 gb, disabled the onboard video and added a geforce 6600(its all i need for the games i play), cleaned out the &quot;crap&quot; i dont need from the hard drive, bought anti-virus, d/l spybot, adaware and spywareblaster, and my machine flies without problems.
and emachines does use decent, not great, hardware.
but for the money and self-upgrading, i would not recommend anything else.
also, i have never had a problem burning cd's, dvd's.
