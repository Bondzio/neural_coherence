<s> I want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iPhone. </s>
<s> Hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'N' network card, a small video card, and a battery. </s>
<s> The whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?). </s>
<s> Battery life would be stellar! </s>
<s> And realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250 </s>
<s> another description would be a wirless, dumb terminal, without a keyboard. </s>
<s> and hopefully the possiblility to port usb devices through RDP (I don't have any knowledge in that area) </s>
<s> &quot;thin client tablets&quot; and &quot;smart displays&quot; without keyboard/mouse never caught on and were replaced by laptops with tablet funtionality. </s>

<s> The market wasn't there. </s>
<s> Here's one -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Com_Audrey There are many more. </s>
<s> They were burned before, why should we do this again? </s>

<s> thanks guys, of course, neither of those look very impressive, one advantage should be weight, and 3 pounds doesn't really cut it. </s>
<s> I think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/we-want-a-dead-simple-web-tablet-help-us-build-it/comment-page-10/ 2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof. </s>
<s> without a keyboard, it would be easy. </s>
<s> then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again! </s>

<s> AWESOME!!! </s>
<s> now I wonder how fast remote desktop'ing' would be over http at home thanks everyone! </s>
<s> Netbooks are smaller laptops/Notebook with XP just remote in to your Base machine. </s>
