<s> Hey All, I am going to purchase this machine very soon, waiting on tax refund I understand it come with 512MB DDR400/PC3200 DIMM (2x256MB sticks) and it has 4 memory slots total. </s>
<s> So I want to leave the 2-256 modules in place and add 2-512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM modules. </s>
<s> I want to use the PC2700 or DDR333 (I bielve these are the same) because I have one 512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM already and then I would only need to purchase 1 more, since you have to have memory modules installed in pairs, I understand. </s>
<s> I have read on the motherboards website it accepts DDR333/PC2700 by the way. </s>
<s> You will notice I am trying to run different clock frequency memory modules simultanously. </s>
<s> Do you think there would be much conflict? </s>
<s> In my experience it would not be a problem as the DDR400/PC3200 should clock to the lower demoninator, which would be the 512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM. </s>
<s> Lastly about memory. </s>
<s> It's not an issue that all the modules are not of the same capacity is it? </s>
<s> Like I don't need all 512's or all 256's or all 1GB modules, right? </s>
<s> It never has been for any other pc I have had but want to make sure. </s>
<s> Thanks for reading this far by the way! </s>
<s> That would give me 1.5GB memory running @ 333Mhz. </s>
<s> I don't honestly think the frequency difference from 333Mhz to 400Mhz is going to be noticable. </s>
<s> Do you? </s>
<s> I will also add a x700 Pro PCI-E video card. </s>
<s> Which will free up the 128MB shared memory and rock my gaming world, I believe lol. </s>
<s> I am unsure about a sound card. </s>
<s> I will most likely hook it up as is and decide from there, it's not that important to me. </s>
<s> I see Best Buy has a 19&quot; CRT Flat Screen Monitor in their ad this week for $129.99 then $30 rebate for $99.99 + tax. </s>
<s> It's their own brand name (Insignia). </s>
<s> I have read, so prolly only average performance but still 19&quot;!! </s>
<s> I will add this also :)- Thanks very much for reading and responding :P </s>
<s> i think ure referring to the t6212. </s>
<s> the ram it uses is ddr400/pc3200 although it is compatible with ddr333/pc2700. </s>
<s> i'm not sure whether dat is possible to run it different speeds. </s>
<s> i would rather by the same speed ones at 400mhz. </s>
<s> What is the price difference? </s>
<s> Is it so much dat ure not willing to fork over the dough? </s>
<s> Also i would not go with the x700 pro as it suks compared to the 6600gt. </s>
<s> at newegg, evga 6600 gt is $160. </s>
<s> Hey, Sorry, ya T6212 for sure, thanks for clarify. </s>
<s> Well I have 1-stick of 512MB DDR333/PC2700 already in the pc I am using now and wanted to use it so I would only have to buy 1. </s>
<s> I guess I will give it a shot and see what happens. </s>
<s> It's not like it would damage anything and if it runs great then what the heck lol. </s>
<s> On to the x700 vs. 6600GT. </s>
<s> I have read some reviews and they seem to be very close in comparison but I have read about people with similar machines to T6212 with ATI strucures built in to the motherboards that have said they get better graphics from the x700. </s>
<s> The reason for my choice btw. </s>
<s> Maybe that's not so? </s>
<s> Could you point me to a place where I can read more up on the two vs each other? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
