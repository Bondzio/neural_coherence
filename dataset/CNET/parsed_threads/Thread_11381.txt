<s> i am looking at buying a laptop, and instead of paying the outragous cost for a 80 gb solid state hard drive just buying on with more capacity and having it installed any advice </s>
<s> Sorry but the benchmarks are done and I won't duplicate that here. </s>
<s> It's simply a matter of did they sell you on the features. </s>
<s> They didn't for me and I have a rather nice history of many laptops over the years (more than 10) and zero hard disk failures. </s>
<s> In fact all machines went on to other family members who killed them for me. </s>
<s> Mostly they run over them with cars or dropping down a stairwell. </s>
<s> Funny thing is that the hard disk survived and we got the files out. </s>
<s> Now why would I not use a hard disk? </s>

<s> i am considering the solid state drive for the battery life enhancement, speed( if that is true, i couldnt find much on that), and the fact that the wirling drive tends to make all laptops i have used extremely hot. </s>
<s> We have this Atom based netbook with an 160GB hard disk. </s>
<s> The heat is not in the hard disk area. </s>
<s> Seems like that's not the source there. </s>
