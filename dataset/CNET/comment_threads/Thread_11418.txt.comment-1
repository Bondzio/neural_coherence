Hi, Having done as much research as seems possible on the internet, I'd appreciate some input to help choose between these color laser printers: - Xerox Phaser 6500DN - Konica Minolta Magicolor 3730DN - HP Color LaserJet CP3525dn - Epson AcuLaser C3900DN - Lexmark C734dn Anybody with experience of using any of them?
Please post positive / negative views, especially re reliability issues and hidden / unexpected costs.
Some background info Currently a SOHO user, expanding in one years time to small business of 3+ people who will share the printer.
Main use is printing duplexed A4 high quality flyers as well as teaching materials; these include (some colored) text, graphs and photographic content.
Other (smaller) sizes and heavier weights of paper are occasionally printed.
I already have an OKI B6200 laser printer with duplexer for plain B/W printing.
Main criteria + budget of &#8364;350-&#8364;700 + text, graphic and photo printing must be as close to excellent as possible (for a laser) - slower print speeds are acceptable if not extreme - higher printing costs acceptable within reason Thnx in advance for any comments on these printers, or even for other printers that you think might fit the bill.
