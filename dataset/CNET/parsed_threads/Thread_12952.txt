<s> the p3 topped out at 1ghz. </s>
<s> there was a 1.26ghz, 512kb cache p3 chip but it was a rare beast and was not supported by most chipsets. </s>
<s> a 1.2ghz celeron may work, but it really won't provide any performance boost. </s>
<s> You could find and plug in the sligthly faster P3 that did fit the socket, the BIOS may balk and the power supplies may not be up to the task. </s>
<s> Don't do this. </s>
<s> Look to other areas for a little speed such as enough RAM for the OS in use and maybe a video card upgrade. </s>
