<s> hi there. </s>
<s> I have an old time built pc with an AMD chip 575 i think its around that any way. </s>
<s> I formatted the hard drive yesterday and since doing this the hard drive is no long reconized by the computer. </s>
<s> Can any body help pls. </s>
<s> When you boot up the computer is the harddrive showing on the black and white bootscreen? </s>
<s> How do you know the harddrive isn't seen anymore? </s>
<s> What happens if you use the windows bootdisk and you get to the A: drive.......can you change to the C: drive? </s>
<s> If you can, then the drive is seen and you can install Windows as long as your bootdisk gave you cdrom support. </s>
<s> Need more info, please... TONI </s>
<s> the hard drive is only 12gb using windows xp home. </s>
<s> i no its not there because on the black screen its not recorded and also in bios under hard ware its not there says not installed for hard drives. </s>
<s> when putting boot disk in it says not c drive </s>
<s> from view in the Bios says to me: 1) a power cable is disconnected 2) a data cable is disconnected 3) the drive is kaput.... judging from the age you indicate, #3 is my choice. </s>
<s> the hard drive worked in my second computer. </s>
<s> after playing around in bios i managed to get it working so thanks any way. </s>
