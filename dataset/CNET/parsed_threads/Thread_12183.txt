<s> Hi, I was about to purchase 2 seagate 300GB hard drives (seagate as they have 5 yr warranty) with the intention of setting up a simple raid so that my data is mirrored across both drives, hence 2 copies of the same data, I believe its called RAID 1, ofcourse I want the RAID purely for backup reasons. </s>
<s> I was all ready to go however a friend of mine told me that if my motherboard was to give up the ghost I would lose all my data unless i find the exact same motherboard and plug the hard drives in, this worried me as the whole point of setting up a RAID is to have data protection, my thought was there is nothing fancy going on, just a simple copy of data will exist on both hard drives, I mean I thought even if I take both hard drives and put it in a totally different machine I Can setup RAID 1 mirroring again if needs be and it wouldnt be a problem. </s>
<s> My motherboard is the Abit KN8 series with the Nforce4 chipset, I think the RAID utility built into the motherboard is by Nvidia but not 100% sure on that. </s>
<s> Any help or answers will be very much appreciated as I'm very confused! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> That it's not a viable backup system. </s>
<s> For years I've seen this one as owners scream as the virus duplicates on both drives or wipes both drives at the same time. </s>
<s> If the OS makes a mistake, then it's dutifully copied to the mirror. </s>
<s> No sale here. </s>
<s> I won't write how the delete key figures into this one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you've brought up some interesting points, I'm not TOO worried about viruses as I havent had one for over 2 years now, but I guess it is something to consider. </s>
<s> the OS will be on a seperate drive so in regard to the OS making a mistake, it should lower the chances a bit. </s>
<s> As for delete theres always recycle bin (there will be very little access if any from the network). </s>
<s> After a little research there is backup software available such as retrospect, so I might just take that route with scheduled backups twice a week or something. </s>
<s> If you were in my position Bob what would you do?, I really dont want to go towards removable media like DVD's, hard disks are much more conveniant and with the 5 year warranty even if it only lasts 5 years I am happy. </s>
<s> I will have to do a bit more thinking, I might just have to go towards using software like retrospect. </s>
<s> Thx again </s>
<s> 2 drives and a simple copy from one to the other on a 7 day rotation. </s>
<s> This gives me 6 or 7 days till a file I deleted is long gone. </s>
<s> I don't bother with backup of the OS, programs or such. </s>
<s> You can determine your needs and make a plan you can live with. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That might be the best way then, one final question, what application do you use?, I need an application which is reliable you see, after some reading up retrospect seems ok but would like to hear about what you use. </s>
<s> A simple batch file that fires off each day. </s>
<s> We used to use PKZIP to compress but with NTFS compression switched on, we dropped that. </s>
<s> All native tools. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for all the advice, appreciated Will place the order today. </s>
