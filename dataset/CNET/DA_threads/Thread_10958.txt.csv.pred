1.1.1	This is probably a silly question, but, is there a significant difference between a multimedia desktop and a gaming desktop?	St
1.1.2	That is, if I buy a gaming comp., will it be unsuitable for watching DVDs and TV?	St
1.1.3	Likewise, if I buy a multimedia comp., will the graphics card, etc., likely be insufficient to play current and next gen. games?	St
1.1.4	My problem is that I want to buy a computer (perhaps a desktop) for college, one that can handle next-gen gaming, play DVDs, and be used to watch TV.	St
1.1.5	My confusion regarding gaming versus multimedia has made it difficult for me to properly research.	St
1.1.6	Please excuse my novice understanding of computer lingo, any help is greatly appreciated!	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Gaming usually means you need a 3D card which is not required for Media such as Tv, DVD and photos.	St
1.3.2	So one could use a gaming PC and be sure it has the chops for DVD and TV.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	gaming computers generaly have better video cards and multimedia computer usaly have things like TV tuners and remote controls.	St
1.4.2	that dosnet mean multimedia computers cant have great video cards or gaming computers cant have tv tuners this is just how it is usaly clasifed.	St
1.5.1	Gaming computers and multimedia computers are both computers at the core.	St
1.5.2	It's just that multimedia computers are usually outfitted with a remote control or a tv-tuner.	St
1.5.3	If you want a beast of a machine that can do it all, get a gaming machine and then drop in a tv-tuner.	St
1.5.4	Then you can watch cable tv or any other input that the tuner will alow.	St
1.5.5	REMEMBER: it doesn't matter which type you get because you can always upgrade the system to suite your needs (ei.	St
1.5.6	upgrade a multimedia pc with a better video card so it runs games at higher resolutions) that's about all you need to know Dre	St
1.6.1	Gaming is better than multimedia, and can of course handle multimedia (better than multimedia pc's can).	St
1.7.1	Which way you decide to go, I would recommend you have at least 1GH Memory as a minimum.	St
1.7.2	2HG will give you plenty to run major programs as well as handle all the programs that run in the background.	St
1.8.1	Any system will work for both .......... well.	St
1.8.2	let me clarify that: Stay away from base model budget systems.	St
1.8.3	You will need a CPU that can handle heavy multitask responsibilities.	St
1.8.4	High-end P4s or AMDs will cover that.	St
1.8.5	I'm not that well-practiced with the new dual-cores.	St
1.8.6	I can tell you that a zapper P4 is tough to beat.	St
1.8.7	My nephew has an AMD in his system that rocks.	St
1.8.8	Those are both good choices.	Polite
1.8.9	2 Gigs should be standard these days.	St
1.8.10	Go ahead and buy 2 Gigs.	Sug
1.8.11	You will not regret that.	St
1.8.12	Get a base model graphix card and upgrade that after you buy the PC.	St
1.8.13	Most graphix card manufacturers have system scans available online.	St
1.8.14	As far as gamimg goes, no game works exactly the same on any system.	St
1.8.15	Keep that in mind when someone tells you that you bought the wrong graphix card.	St
1.8.16	What's good for the goose isn't always good for the gander.	St
1.8.17	Good luck.	St
1.9.1	For next gen games the graphics card is far far more important than the processor.	St
1.9.2	Any processor 3ghz and up (or AMD equivalent) should be fine but have plenty of ram and a good draphics card.	St
1.9.3	i.e atleast 256MB PCI express nvidia 7600 or ati x800.	St
1.9.4	These cards are really not that expensive nowardays and should cope but a 7800/7900 or an ATI x1800 would be a better longer lasting choice.	St
1.10.1	He sounded like he was strapped - so I suggested a starting point.	St
1.10.2	And, by the way, I did tell him to get some heavy RAM.	St
1.11.1	the only concern.	St
1.11.2	Like others have said/will say, gaming is the biggest concern you will have.	St
1.11.3	Gaming and maybe, MAYBE video editing, is the things that are the most demanding on a computer.	St
1.11.4	As long as your computer has a good graphics card, a good amount of RAM and a TV tuner card, you should be ok.	St
1.12.1	First off, thank you to everyone who responded.	Polite
1.12.2	I feel MUCH better informed now.	St
1.12.3	As I understand it, I am better off buying a gaming desktop, and then adding a TV tuner, etc.	St
1.12.4	Do any of you have a recommendation for me?	Ques
1.12.5	I'd like to stay at or under $2,000.	St
1.12.6	If something earth-shattering goes for $2,500, that's fine.	St
1.12.7	But please, no recs for $3,000 and up desktops, that's just too much for me.	St
1.12.8	Thank you again, you guys are the best!	St
1.13.1	Ok i worded what i meant wrong.	St
1.13.2	In my opinion he can save a bit of money on getting a slightly lesser processor and spend that on his graphics card.	St
1.13.3	With processors a change as small as 200mghz can vary price by like $100 which is not really worth it.	St
1.14.1	For that you can get a very very nice pc.	St
1.14.2	I would think more in the range of 1500 could get you something pretty decent.	St
1.14.3	Checkout dell because although i dont like them they tend to be pretty reasonable.	St
