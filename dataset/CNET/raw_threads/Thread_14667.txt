There find the details for HD replacement( I assume new HD), that's the same info as adding 2nd or swapping out old HD. In most cases, if no screws are present o open case, locate a &quot;latch&quot;, depress and slide side cover back or up to remove. If you have a model that's a &quot;clam type&quot; you need to open as if like a book, spread the case open. I hope this helps. Once again, it always helps if you provide details of your PC as much as possible. tada -----Willy
