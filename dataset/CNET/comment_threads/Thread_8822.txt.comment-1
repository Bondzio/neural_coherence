Ok so heres the deal im running an old machine and wanted to upgrade the memory heres the specs for a start mother board: MICRO-STAR INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD......MS-6577 Proccesor: celeron 2.4ghz RAM DIMM1: Elpida EBD52UC8AAFA-7B 512 MB PC2100 DDR SDRAM (2.5-3-3-6 @ 133 MHz) (2.0-2-2-5 @ 100 MHz) DIMM2: Micron Tech.
8VDDT3264AG-335C4 256 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM (2.5-3-3-7 @ 166 MHz) (2.0-3-3-6 @ 133 MHz) Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 (256 MB) ok so i got 768mb of ram running at the speeds above, i recently brought a 1gb pc2700 stick to upgrade and put along side the 512mb pc2100 stick i allready have.
now i added the 1gb stick and i got the beeping noise that lasts for 5 seconds(2 second interval) now to my knowledge this is a memory error but on the msi website(the maker of my moterboard) it says that pc2700 is compatible!
the only other thing i could think of is the high and low density compatibility issue??????
IS MY MOTHERBOARD HIGH DENSITY RAM COMPATIBLE???
the new ram i brought is high density, could this be the problem???
also the 1gb ram boots up along side the 512mb ram in the 1 slot (BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND) and shows up as 7968MB!!!!!
BUT THEN NONE OF THE RAM WORKS AND USES THE MOTHER BOARD RAM OF 32MB
