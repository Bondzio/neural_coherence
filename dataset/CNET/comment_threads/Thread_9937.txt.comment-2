I would not recommend a Dell because of lack of customer support.
Tech support is based in India.
Don't get me wrong they build good systems.
They are not necessarily best value for the money.
Personally I would shop around.
&quot;The new Dimension XPS Gen4 XPS case is the most expandable Dimension chassis offered.
It supports up to three 400GB hard drives, two PCI Express slots and three 5.25-inch drive bays for the highest levels of scalability with a cooling design that runs quietly&quot;.
Prices currently starting at $1,999 Ships 1/20/2005 Here is a link for the XPS.
