lucky for us we found your old supply.
there must be some thousands of models that will work in it's place.
-&gt; but let me add that before you replace it, inspect the motherboard for bad caps as your parts are in the time frame of the bad caps days.
google bad caps for the pictures and stories.
finally, add 100 more watts so we're sure there is more reserve and you won't be replacing it in a few months.
