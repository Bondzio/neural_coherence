Our office has no less than 3 netbooks.
All have run our powerpoints fine.
HOWEVER none have embedded videos so this is why it works.
Would the connection be compatible with every projector?
No.
I've yet to find this to be true since it never fails that you will find one projector that has DVI and laptops don't have that.
