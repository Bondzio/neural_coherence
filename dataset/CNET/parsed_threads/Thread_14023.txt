<s> I'm Considering selling some used hard drives. </s>
<s> I want to make sure the information on those drives can never be recovered. </s>
<s> Besides completely destroying the drive with a power drill, is their a way of erasing the information, that's just as effective? </s>
<s> I have a program that writes all zeroes to the drive. </s>
<s> (Takes 1 - 5 Hours) But is this good enough? </s>

<s> ` Good luck. </s>
<s> If the drive is zeroed out, 1 pass, how can it still be recovered? </s>
<s> Could their be residual magnetic information left, that could be reversed? </s>

<s> As well, they've too many targets who don't protect themselves well. </s>
<s> I'd say that, for most purposes, such as Dban are more than adequate. </s>
<s> Even one pass from the HD manufacturer's destructive diagnostics utility will make the platters unreadable from within the same drive mechanism. </s>
<s> Why don'y you go for disk sanitization services provided by professionals. </s>
<s> This service will erase your data completely and will leave no chances of further recovery of data. </s>
