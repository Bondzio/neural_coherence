1.1.1	I downloaded CPUz and it says I have bus speed of 333.31.	St
1.1.2	It also says that I have a FSB of 1333.31 What is FSB?	St
1.1.3	When I had this machine built they told me I had a front bus of 1320.	St
1.1.4	Is this the same thing?	St
1.2.1	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_QuickPath_Interconnect is likely going to do nothing but create more questions.	St
1.2.2	Can you reveal why you are looking at these numbers versus performing a benchmark to compare your system?	St
1.2.3	Or better yet, use your PC?	Sug
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do not have the expertise to what you are taking about.	St
1.3.2	I just want to know what I have.	St
1.3.3	Tommorow I am puting in Gigabyte Geforce GTX 660 card.	St
1.3.4	Here is the rest.	St
1.3.5	The nachine was built for me about 6 years ago CPU Z 64 bit tells me this is what machine is PCIe 3.0 x16 http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-geforce-gtx-650-ti GA-P35-DS3L (rev.	St

1.4.1	Does not fit in this small space.	St
1.4.2	I see you added a lot of details but what I see is the usual run of the mill Quad Core PC.	St
1.4.3	These can play games with a good video card but the usual issue is the power supply.	St
1.4.4	Did you make sure it will support your card?	St
1.4.5	And no software will check or report this for you.	Sug
1.4.6	The list looks like one of those HP or Dell machines.	St
1.4.7	If it is, why didn't you write &quot;I have a HP d4999t&quot;?	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	The machine was custom built about 6 years ago.	St
1.5.2	It has a 500 watt power supply and my aaaaaaapc 1500 tells me it is only drawing 90 watts.	St
1.5.3	what does FSB stand for in CPU-z?	St
1.6.1	same MB.	St
1.6.2	Maybe he'll give up the PSU info ....otherwise it could an be a tough road ahead for the new GPU.	Sug
1.6.3	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Then we run the risk of overtaxing a RAIL.	St
1.7.2	Look at the stick on the side and get the specs AND THE AGE since PSUs degrade over time.	St
1.7.3	I try to keep at 50% of any RAIL as well as the total.	St
1.7.4	Thanks for the APC Watt reading.	St
1.7.5	You're going to do well!	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	I think Proffett is messing with you.	St
1.8.2	But!	St
1.8.3	It looks like the 333 is probabally Frequency and maybe the 1333 is the chip set.	St
1.8.4	I really don't know.	St
1.8.5	I don't have the latest version of CPUZ but mine dose not show Front Side Bus so I am just wild guessing.	St
1.8.6	Good luck.	St
