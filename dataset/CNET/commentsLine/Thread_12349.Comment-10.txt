i have a linksys cable modem and netgear router.
they work great together.
i put a netgear adapter in the laptop and have never had any problem.
i put a linksys adapter in the desktop and had nothing but problems.
the connection was constantly being dropped.
i changed to a netgear adapter and all the problems went away.
everything works great.
i'm new to this and the guy in the store assured me brand doesn't matter but i can't help but believe it does.
i think like brands probably talk to each other better.
just my opinion.
