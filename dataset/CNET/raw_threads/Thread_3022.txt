And if you read the HP Forums you find you've selected a problematic combo. But let us try anyway. Since we don't disable the i810 video, we just set the AGP or PCI to be the primary display and then connect the display to the card/connection we want. Then we install the ATI drivers. NO! We don't uninstall the i810 video drivers. bob

Connect monitor to connection that works. 5. Set BIOS to PCI if I added a PCI card, or AGP if I installed an AGP card. Save and reboot. 6. Move monitor connection if need be. 7. Let windows boot. 8. Just ok all the errors. 9. Install the drivers. Best of luck. If that doesn't do it, then it's likely you are like many other owners and need to try a Nvidia card. Bob

So can we still do this wihthout going by the manual.It doesnt give good details. Step 4 Do you mean connect to onboard monitor port or new Radeon monitor port that works. Step 5 Can u explain how to access BIOS Im installing PCI card. Step 6 Switch monitor ports if needed?

So can we still do this wihthout going by the manual.It doesnt give good details.&quot; And that is what throws HP owners with i810 chipsets for a loop. Some don't have a disable. But I already noted this. So we get to leave it alone and trudge forward. Some get stuck at this step for a very long time. &quot;Step 4 Do you mean connect to onboard monitor port or new Radeon monitor port that works.&quot; You use the one that works. &quot;Step 5 Can u explain how to access BIOS Im installing PCI card.&quot; If the Radeon is the boot display, we don't need to do this. &quot;Step 6 Switch monitor ports if needed?&quot; Use the one that works. Since it's the Radeon, we're done. Bob

Connect monitor to connection that works.Power up DO I Connect to new Radeon card ? 5. (Set BIOS to PCI if I added a PCI card, or AGP if I installed an AGP card. Save and reboot.) Do I NEED to check if my BIOS is set for PCI I recall seeing a message saying no pci slots filled when Radeon was in. Plus I only have PCI slots in my PC . 6. Move monitor connection if need be.OK 7. Let windows boot. OK 8. Just ok all the errors. Hmmm OK 9. Install the drivers. OK

Proffitt	10/7/04 5:29 AM	1.09712694E12	Re: Help installing Radeon 7500	You wrote that the video appeared on the new Radeon card so we have no reason to &quot;check&quot; the BIOS. As I previously wrote, your selection of card and machine is not assured to work. You can read many horror stories about it, but I have supplied what I do to get the ones that will work to install. If it doesn't, then you won't see any magic fix from me. Bob

You did mention the HP forums http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?product=81921&lang=en&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&docname=bph06273 This is very helpful but still confusing I have installed the card with those steps mentioned and still having unsure doubts weather or not its installed right One thing is when i open Device manager under Display adapters RADEON 7500 SERIES this seems to be right But then I see this new catagory called ? Other devices ? PCI VGA-Compatible Display Adapter with red X in it Does this also have to be woking properly should i reinstall it Ive tried playing the game and its working ok not great Also in Control panel/systems/properties says this Memory 511 system res 60% free File Sys 32-bit Virt Mem 32-bit Disk Comp not installed PC Cards{PCMCIA} No PC Card sockets are installed system conf optimal perfomance

If you must have a &quot;clean&quot; device manager, I'd have to visit the machine. By forum its tough since some will do odd things that I don't know about. I did write that I don't uninstall the old drivers, but some try anyway and that's where the items will show on i810 based systems. ATI makes instructions that work for 98% or better of the machines out there. For you, you need better. Hope this helps, Bob

Last install i thought the game was running fine then i was bombarded with errors like INS5576,OLEAUT32dll and would only start in safe mod Also ATI has informed me not to pay any attention to thier so called PC Check has a few bugs in it http://64.4.53.250/cgi-bin/linkrd?_lang=EN&lah=346a15a8c7ac13bd4eec067ac83dcd79&lat=1097193960&hm___action=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eati%2ecom%2fsupport%2finfobase%2f4068%2ehtml
