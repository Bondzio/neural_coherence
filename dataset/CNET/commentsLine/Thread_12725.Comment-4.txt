it looks like you set it up for a radius server.
but i can't tell yet.
focus on the router and be sure the router firmware is the latest since i've seen this error where some machines connect and some don't.
the poor owner couldn't accept it was out of date firmware so they ended up paying 2 companies to come look.
the second one they let change the firmware.
they wanted a refund from us.
we said no.
