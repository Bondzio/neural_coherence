12273	0	226221	2362216	NR	william551	1/1/07 5:12 PM	1.16767152E12	I have a general question about 64 bit	Is direct x 10 and dual core and windows vista and all those new video cards? Are they all going 64 bit? Leaving us 32 bitters in the dust?

Since LCD (lowest common denominator) runs the marketplace I don't expect 32 bit systems to vanish or even be slighted for years. Bob
