yeah ive checked out the layout of my mb and compared it to the one im about to buy.
its basically the same thing except an upgrade with 2 more ram slots and an agp slot.
same 3 pci slots and usb jacks and ect.
this is the one im planing on buying http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16813131460 and this is the one i have http://usa.asus.com/prog/spec.asp?m=P4SDR-VM&langs=09 (yes that one comes with agp but i guess compaq has the ones w/o or something)
