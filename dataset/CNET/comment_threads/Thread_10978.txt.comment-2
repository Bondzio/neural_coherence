Unless the OS is running on the remote PC, it's not going to be able to respond automatically to a print command but I'm not sure what you mean by power saving mode.
Anything like standby or hibernate is not going to work.
It might be possible use a WOL (wake on LAN) scheme but these are rather tricky and, in my limited experience with them, a bit flaky too...that's the best I can describe these as I've only used them with NAS hardware.
You can certainly just turn off the monitor and leave the PC running...perhaps even allow the HD to power down, but I have to wonder if another option might be just to use a network print server.
The downside of these is finding compatibility between printer and server.
They don't all work gracefully.
But, if that's an option, you can leave the other PC off and it will still have access to the printer when you do turn it on.
Good luck.
