i truly agree with you bob 100% cause i have a emachine 633ids with the bio's upgraded to a hp logo on boot & a intel celeron 1.1 ghz cpu with 512 megs of ram (still want to see if it will accept over that 768 or 1 gig) & it's still going strong & it's an old system.
a friend gave me this machine & i rebuilt it back up & installed a 1394 ieee pci card & a 10/100/1000 ghz ethernet card.
those amd boards are not as good as a intel board.
my wife is using a emachine w3080 3000+ amd board & it's had some problem's but still going strong.
she's going to be real upset if that mobo ever goes out.
i guess i'll wait to see if he has another board availible & install it & if that doesn't work then i will purchase a new board with a fast intel base setup.
thank's for your comments.
david
