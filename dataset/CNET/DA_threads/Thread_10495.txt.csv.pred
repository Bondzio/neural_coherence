1.1.1	Hi , I have a custom built computer with an Intel Pentium D processor , ATI Radeon X800 video card , a 250 gig hdd , and an Intel mobo .	St
1.1.2	My computer worked for 3 months until one day , upon turning it on , both my mobo and my power supply fried .	St
1.1.3	I replaced both , and it started working again .	St
1.1.4	However , 6 hours after it started working , it just turned off .	St
1.1.5	It had no response to anything .	St
1.1.6	I replaced the power supply with a more powerful one from a amore reliable company , and now , wheenever I turn on the power supply the computer 's case fans and the video card 's fan will click on for a second .	St
1.1.7	At the same time , there is a strange clicking noise that the computer makes .	St
1.1.8	What could be the problem ?	Ques
1.1.9	Is it a grounding issue ?	Ques
1.1.10	Or is it something else I have n't thought of ?	Ques
1.2.1	Too bad , you 're learning the hard way that power issues effect the whole system .	St
1.2.2	3mo .	St
1.2.3	is n't long for a decent system to feel the effects of a poor psu .	St
1.2.4	You did the right thing in covering the repair , replacing both psu and mtrbd .	St
1.2.5	but it & quot ; seems & quot ; you settled on a lesser wattage unit ( same value ? )	Ques
1.2.6	and not a higher wattage one in the replacement process and in all probably used the same cpu , etc .	St
1.2.7	componets to rebuild the system .	St
1.2.8	A secnondary problem was lying in wait of one of the other componets .	St
1.2.9	You should remove all HDs , CDs , and even the FD drive and make it as simple as possible system .	St
1.2.10	Try then to reboot , if it fails quickly , shutdown .	St
1.2.11	Now , teardown the whole system and rebuild it with care to mounting posts , cabling etc .	St
1.2.12	back to a simple system to rerty again .	St
1.2.13	It need not be in the system case , on cardboard or *NON-CONDUCTIVE & quot ; surface to make the system to see what the results are .	St
1.2.14	If it still fails , then again the mtrbd .	St
1.2.15	or psu was made kaput .	St
1.2.16	If not and it boots-up , then add & quot ; one & quot ; componet at a time until it fails or seems to be stable .	St
1.2.17	Allow it work for awhile , just leave it alone for hrs .	St
1.2.18	and see if it still works .	St
1.2.19	Return to system case if it does and proceed there one step at a time .	St
1.2.20	Verify all your work , etc. , no guessing or taking anything for granted , if any thoughts , replace or test elsewhere .	St
1.2.21	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	last fall i built two PCs similar to yours ... intel 945 mobos , antec cases/power supplies , dual sata drives , p4d 3.0ghz in one , p4 3.4ghz in the other .	St
1.3.2	the first build went smooth as butter and booted up the first try .	St
1.3.3	the second one took me another 4 days because it would n't boot .	St
1.3.4	the lan leds would come on , the cpu fan would spin for a sec , then nothing .	St
1.3.5	i tore down the functioning pc and started swapping parts and still no luck .	St
1.3.6	my problem was the extra 2x2 pin mobo power connector ( 12V processor core voltage ) ... i forgot to plug it in .	St
1.3.7	hope your problem is as simple .	St
1.4.1	I already made sure that was plugged in .	St
1.4.2	My case fans start up and the LED lights do turn on , as well as the CPU 's water cooling starting up for about a split second ... then they all turn off .	Sug
1.4.3	The light on the mobo is on .	St
1.4.4	And it is a 600 watt power supply , should be almost excessive .	St
1.4.5	I did take it to Best Buy once when I got this problem ... they got it to boot but I have no idea how .	St
1.5.1	You should check out this page which helps you understand how your computer starts up , then troubleshoot from there .	Sug
