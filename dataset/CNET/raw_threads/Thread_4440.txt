I'll fix one thing, and everything will be fine for weeks to months, and then some other problem arises. I think it's something to do with the IDE bus, because sometimes an IDE device won't be detected during boot, or POST won't get beyond &quot;Detecting IDE devices&quot;. I've run diagnostics on memory and disk drives, replaced a disc drive (I try to run 2 Western digital 200 GB Caviar drives and a Seagate 200GB Barracuda) and upgraded BIOS on everything I could), just installed a new MoBo (Asus A8N5X), went to an ATX case with 3 fans, and just today I got a blue screen &quot;a process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited&quot; when I tried to add the WD drive to a simplified Seagate/HP 840i DVD writer ide chain. I'm plunking down big $$ to get an Antec 550W powersupply today. Has anyone ever heard of a defective IDE device ruining another IDE device? Am I asking for trouble with 4 IDE devices in my box? - if so, will replacing one IDE drive with a SATA relieve the strain?

I've been swapping cables in and out. Some times it seems to fix the problems, but it never &quot;stays fixed&quot;. My last hope is a new 550W ps.

There's no description of the machine, the drives, drive age, details about the OS install etc... I had this one owner that was a P2P user. They lost it all weekly for about a year until we figured that out. Bob

The Western Digital WD2000JB drives are one year old, and two years old respectively. Today it's a fresh XP PRo install, with all Microsoft updates applied. AMD A64 X2 4400+ processor and a eVGA GeForce 6200 video card. Weekly, huh? I guess I should consider myself lucky..

But since I swapped in the new power supply, things have been running as smooth as a gravy sandwich. But, if it follows the pattern, things will go belly up in a month or two... The good news is, I can't think of anything else to replace! Thanks again for your prompt responses!
