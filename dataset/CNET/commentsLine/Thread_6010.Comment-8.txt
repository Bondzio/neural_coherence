after rereading what you said about &quot;master with slave&quot;, i choked on my reply to you and decided to check it out.
before i even went searching for my old installation instructions to figure out how to configure the jumper, i just tried removing the jumper altogether.
i did that, then i disconnected the 40gb again, and all is working great.
windows booted up immediately as it should have without the 40gb drive, and i'm very happy.
thank you, thank you, thank you!
