6849	0	45195	534263	NR	Lupini	11/11/04 8:21 AM	1.10016126E12	Wireless printing	I just aquired an HP 7100 notebook and want to send printing wirelessly. I have an Imac desktop which is connected to a wireless router from Roadrunner and I cannot get the HP to tranfer what I want printed from a remote location. The printer is an HP Photosmart model #7960 which is connected by USB to the Imac which is running OX 10. The note book is running XP

It's too far out to help remotely since not only must you deal with cross-OS issues but the Wifi as well. Unless you get lucky, you'll either pay to have it setup or install a wifi USB printer server that supports your selected machines. Bob
