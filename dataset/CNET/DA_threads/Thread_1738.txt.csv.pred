1.3.2	If you can use a standard household phone and want to go one of the least expensive routes try this Vonage starter kit at http : //www.amazon.com/Broadband-Phone-Service-Starter-Kit/dp/B001BJCYZ8 The box plugs into your router , then plug your cordless phone into the box and you 're in business .
