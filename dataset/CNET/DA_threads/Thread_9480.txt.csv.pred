1.1.1	Hey Im planning to buy a new pc.Not spending too much but i want to get the most out of my money .	St
1.1.2	I just need help with choosing the motherboard and Im thinking of have a dual channel for the ram because i heard that its pretty good .	St
1.1.3	here 's the website that im going to buy it from : http : //www.pricespy.co.nz/cat_6.html ? s=1 & g=175 and here are the components that i 've chosen so far : Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 , 2.4GHz , LGA775 , quad core $ 386.35 Seagate 250GB 7200rpm 8MB Cache 3Gb/s SATAII hard drive	St
1.2.1	you start over .	St
1.2.2	Your doing this backwards start with the motherboard and then add from there .	St
1.2.3	Choose a mother board with the most universal socket that you can get then make sure it can run the most advanced CPU that is available the day you buy it .	St
1.2.4	Motherboard first then CPU then RAM and Graphics card , then all the rest .	St
1.2.5	Much of this will depend on your personal needs and wants choose components that fit them .	St
1.3.1	definitely go with a mobo based on the intel p31 or p35 chipset .	St
1.3.2	these mobos will support intel 's latest 45nm ( penryn ) cpus so you 'll have an upgrade path in the near future .	St
1.3.3	the abit ip35 , gigabyte ga-p35 , msi p35 neo2 families of mobos are good choices , but from your list gigabyte seems to have the best price and availabilty .	St
1.3.4	i suggest you consider these three : Gigabyte GA-P31-S3L Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3 Gigabyte GA-P35-S3L Gigabyte 's naming suffixes can be confusing , so here 's a comparison chart .	Sug
1.3.5	the mobo price goes up as features are added , so determine what features you 'll use and buy the mobo that delivers .	St
1.3.6	( no reason to pay for a 2nd pci-express slot , 8gb ram support , 2 extra sata ports , extra overclocking support , and 4 extra usb ports if you 're not going to use them . )	St
1.3.7	p.s .	St
1.3.8	: you 're going about your build properly .	St
1.3.9	but if you plan on overclocking , you should get a p35 based mobo ( not p31 ) and go with better ram ( cl4 or faster from ocz , corsair , crucial , mushkin , etc .	St
1.3.10	) .	St
1.4.1	wow thanks for your reply guys .	Polite
1.4.2	What do you mean go by a better ram ?	Ques
1.4.3	as in brand wise or the capacity or what ?	Ques
1.4.4	And I wanted to ask you , does it matter if the ram is eec or not eec or dont they have that anymore ?	Ques
1.4.5	So gigabyte is a good mobo ?	Ques
1.4.6	I heard asus makes the best mobos ?	Ques
1.4.7	?	Ques
1.5.1	better ram = lower cas latency .	St
1.5.2	your original post mentioned kingston value ram , cl 5. i suggest you go with cl 4 ram instead ... ddr2-800 cl4 can be picked up for $ 40USD/gb so there 's no reason to use cl5 unless $ 5- $ 10 will break your budget .	St
1.5.3	for desktop boards , you do n't need error correcting memory .	St
1.5.4	asus , msi , gigabyte , and abit are the 'name ' brands for mobo using intel chipset .	St
1.5.5	asus is very popular ( largest oem mfg , much like hertz vs. avis and budget ) and thus they can charge a bit more , however any of these brands will get you a top-notch mobo .	St
1.5.6	http : //www.hothardware.com/Articles/Intel_P35_Express_Comparison_ASUS__Gigabyte/	St
1.6.1	Hey thanks for your reply .	Polite
1.6.2	Ok can I ask you guys for a big favour ?	Ques
1.6.3	Can you help me construct a pc from this site : www.pricespy.co.nz All needed parts would be there and my budget would be inside $ 1000 .	St
