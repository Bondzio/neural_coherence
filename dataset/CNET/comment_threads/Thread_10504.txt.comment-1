Hello All, I've been using this dvd writer for the past year and had no problems.
Recently I've written 3 dvd's and weirdly enough it doesn't playback on the dvd writer itself but plays in any other player or dvdrom, so you could say data verification in nero is always a failure.
Any solution how I can play the dvd on the dvd writer, or is there any other problem?
