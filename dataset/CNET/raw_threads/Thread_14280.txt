The external drive does not run the software and I am unable to get it started. I have followed the directions listed that suggest that I go to START, RUN, browse to the drive used for the Maxtor III Mini (C: drive), and open Launch.exe. I can't find a Launch.exe. I know the computer sees the harddrive because it shows up in the Device Manager. Please help. I am running Windows XP.
