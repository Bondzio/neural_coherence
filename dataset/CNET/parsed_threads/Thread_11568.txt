<s> I have 2 routers I would like to use. </s>
<s> An Apple Airport Extreme(AAE) which streams NAS media better and a Cisco that gets a stronger internet 2 ghz connection. </s>
<s> So basically use the Cisco for internet access and use AAE for home media. </s>
<s> Can I connect to both routers at the same time? </s>
<s> 2 examples where I need to have both routers connected are A) Using Macbook or Ipad to Stream media from internet via Cisco and simultaneously playing through wireless home speakers on the AAE network. </s>
<s> B) Download material on laptop while watching a movie from the AAE NAS </s>
<s> But this is done a lot when you use &quot;Router as an Access Point.&quot; See Google to see how that is connected and setup. </s>
<s> The owner of such must learn their routers since they will be maintaining this. </s>
