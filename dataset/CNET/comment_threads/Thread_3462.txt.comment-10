I thought your MN-510 is a wireless-b adapter?
You are supposed to use it to connect to some type of wireless access point.
Therefore, you need to use the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; and not &quot;create a new connection.&quot; What is your setup?
Do you have a wireless router?
If you need help in finding it, just type &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; into Help and Support.
