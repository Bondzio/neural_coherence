Since the Lexmark and the Toshiba are right next to each other and the drops are not too far from each other, why don't you just switch the connection.
Lexmark &gt;Tosh-drop and Copier &gt;Lexmark-drop.
I think you mentioned that if you switch the cables, they work fine, right?
You may not even have to move the devices if the patch cables are long enough.
This will solve it until you figure out the culprit.
