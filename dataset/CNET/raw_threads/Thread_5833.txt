If they are you would think they would be good for long lasting storage Also, I spoke to a tech person from Iomega site regarding there EGO Portable Hard Drives and they are suppose to be extremely durable as well. Sounds like that would be good for long lasting storage as well.

But like any FLASH DRIVE they are easy to drop, misplace or lose outright, have stolen, fail or become corrupt. None are foolproof or fail proof. You need redundancy for data you can't afford or don't want to lose. VAPCMD
