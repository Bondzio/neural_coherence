1.1.1	Ive been confused for a while.	St
1.1.2	I want to upgrade my house with wireless.	St
1.1.3	Looking at reviews from CNet both Belkin Pre N and the Netgear RangMax WPN824 both have excellent ratings.	St
1.1.4	My computers have regular g cards in them, and my laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) has a built in Intel Pro 2200 b/g card in it.	St
1.1.5	It is the main focus for connection since its what i use most.	St
1.1.6	The reason i want to go with such great range routers is that on some days of the week i need connection in an area that is 150-200 feet away.	St
1.1.7	Any help or advice would be appreciated!	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks, Chandan	St
1.2.1	The best advise is to stay away from mix-and-match.	St
1.2.2	You are better off running the same brand of router and card(s).	St
1.2.3	I use the Belkin preN and have had no problems with it other than interferrence with like-frequency wireless phones.	St
1.2.4	That was an easy problem to take care of.	St
1.2.5	Range with the Belkin preN is very good and yes, it does support older/non-preN cards, however if you want to maximize your range and speed, then use preN cards with the router.	St

1.3.1	I bought and returned two wireless routers to Fry's because they wouldn't work for me.	St
1.3.2	The CSR suggested Linksys and I bought one.	St
1.3.3	They are pricey, but the support is good in my experience.	St
1.3.4	I got the WRT 54GS.	St
1.3.5	and added a couple of antennae from freeantenns.com .	St
