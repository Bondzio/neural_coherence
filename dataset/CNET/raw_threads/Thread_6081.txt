I also bought an HP all-in-one model CD035A printer to use primarily for printing 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; photos. I printed about a dozen photos, and all photos had terrible color - totally inaccurate coloration. I returned the printer to the retailer and upon the advice of a Geek Squad representative at the store, I exchanged the HP printer for a Kodak ESP 7. After installing the new printer, much to my dismay, the first 2 - 8 1/2 x 11&quot; glossy photos I printed had the same terrible coloration. Is there something in Windows 7 that causes this? Can I adjust something so I can get accurate coloration? What is causing the bad coloration? My previous HP printer worked like a charm from square one when using a Dell Inspiron equipped with Windows XP Professional. How can I get my color photos to print in accurate colors? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks. potica69
