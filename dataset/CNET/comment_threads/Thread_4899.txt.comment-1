I have an HP desk top with a 80GB hard drive, I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive and also wanted to be able to use the system disks I created when I bought the computer so that the programs that were installed on the computer would still be there.
I have never done this before so I thought I might contact HP and ask if it was possible to do this.
They asured me that it was possible as long as the new hard drive ran the same rmps as the old one.
They told me if the rpms were not the same I would not be able to use my system recovery disks that I created from the computer.
They then tried to sell me a external hard drive which I was really not interested in.
I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive but I want an internal one.
I just wanted to ask if any one knows that this might be true and what has the rpms got to do with my system disks.
The hard drive I now have is an 5400 rpm and I did look at the new one I wanted to buy and it said it was 7200 rpm..Would it be better for me to buy an external hard drive.
I don't want to go into the expense of a new hard drive and then not be able to use my system disks..Thank you, Wright5972
