1.1.2	thanks,	St
1.2.1	doesn't the head set come with an adapter, if it does, then it will work, if it doesn't, then look in the manual, see if they recommend any bluetooth adapters, then buy the recommended adapter, if they don't say anything about an adapter to connect to your pc, like no recommendations at all, then just choose another headset try downloading the manual off the headset's website	St
1.3.1	Thanks ferraritt for responding!	St
