Hello.
I've posted this question over in CNET forum: Home Audio & Video and on AVSforum, but I should try here also.
I own a Defender surveillance DVR SN500 4ch.
It comes with a basic corded usb optical mouse for on-screen navigation.
I've tried using a Logitech 2.4g/nano receiver wireless mouse for remote use but it didn't seem to work after setup.
A Defender-USA representative wasn't sure of a wireless mouse that would work with the DVR.
So, just wondering if anyone here knows of a wireless mouse that works with these types of DVRs ?
