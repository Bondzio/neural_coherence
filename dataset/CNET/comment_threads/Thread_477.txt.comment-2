so that would mean u have the most current nvidia driver?
78.01?
try dling it if u dont.
if that does does not solve your problem, then its either powersupply or graphics card... could u try the graphics card on a different computer?
if it works fine then its ur psu... 420 watt powersupply that came with the case doesnt sound too good...especially with new hard drive, 8 fans, sound card, graphics card, and 2 optical drives gainward also doesnt sound too reputable so it may be your graphics card too....
