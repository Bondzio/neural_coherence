Upon initial install the verizon software might put certain items on the PC that set it up.
It's been awhile but you enter a lot of information to get it working.
My point is without a Router your wifes PC might have this information on it and your desk top doesnt so it's not recognizing your PC as being legit.
I use a 4 port wired router and 2 PC are connect constantly with a 3rd work PC connected occasionally.
I have not problems with this setup and was the best $50 I ever spent because the router is a SPI firewall.
