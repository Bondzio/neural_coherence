<s> I have an IBM SCSI Internal Hard Drive that I use on a MAC running OS 9. </s>
<s> My computer can no longer read the hard drive. </s>
<s> Whenever I boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed. </s>
<s> When it is not installed it boots up fine. </s>
<s> The hard drive came with an adapter that I think may be the cause of the problem. </s>
<s> Is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter? </s>
<s> Below is all the information on the hard drive label: Type: DGHS COMP IEC-950 *ECE32284* *PN59H7013* SN 6810A623GK EMC P/N 072-000-123 11S59H7013ZM1FV110A623 9808 Please let me know if you can help me with this situation. </s>
<s> I've searched the IBM web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help you can give me. </s>
<s> You didn't write how old the drive is, but I know that at about 5 years these drives are at the end of their lifespan and to replace such if need be. </s>
<s> I see 20G hard disks of similar model for the 30 buck range on ebay. </s>
<s> Sounds like a cheap fix. </s>

<s> the date on the drive is August of '98 and we bought it on eBay approximately a year and a half ago. </s>
<s> the problem is, we need to salvage some things on the drive here at our business and we're trying to figure out a way to do it. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> Sorry to hear that. </s>
<s> Try what you can, but the lesson never seems to end, does it? </s>
<s> Remember that most drives are &quot;5 year designs.&quot; The short and long of this is that they make terrible places to keep what we can't lose. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, fortunately our most important stuff was backed up. </s>
<s> It's just some minor stuff we'd like to recover that we want from it. </s>
<s> Thanks for you help though. </s>
