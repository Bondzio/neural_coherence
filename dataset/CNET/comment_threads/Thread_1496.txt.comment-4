Your choice of Windows version Mini runs at 1.6 or 1.83 GHz Mini comes with 512MB RAM expandable to 2GB Not sure about the DirectX thing.
Mac's don't do DirectX but I have seen Parallels, the other method of running Windows on a Mac, cope with DirectX Mini does not come with a Keyboard or Mouse.
Any USB KB or Mouse will do Mini does not come with an Internet connection.
You supply that and the Mini will use it.
Seems like you are set to go.
