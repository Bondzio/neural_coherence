<s> Hello, I have a Dell Dimension 8250 tower which is an older pc, and I would like to try to connect it to my Samsung Series 3-330 if possible. </s>
<s> My goal is to be able watch HD movies downloaded from a P2P network on the big screen. </s>
<s> I was told that the best way to do this is to use a DVI to HDMI cable. </s>
<s> I have confirmed that the Samsung 3-330 TV has 2 HDMI ports in the back, but I am having trouble locating a DVI port on the old dell. </s>
<s> Is this because the Dell 8250 was created without a DVI port? </s>
<s> Is DVI a more recent thing? </s>
<s> The Dell was purchased about 5 years ago. </s>
<s> Is it even possible to connect an older PC to an LCD TV? </s>
<s> It's not worth the trouble. </s>
<s> your pc doesn't have a video card that can accelerate HD content. </s>
<s> here's a $66 agp card that *should* work for you. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131136 (if you get this card, or any ati agp card, only use the drivers that came with the card and completely uninstall any existing video drivers.) </s>
<s> since your pc is fairly old, your power supply might not be up-to-snuff for any new card. </s>
<s> if so, that's another $40. </s>
<s> so, you could wind up spending $100 and a weekend to get your pc and tv working together. </s>
<s> you'll have to decide if it's worth it. </s>
<s> So I am better off just getting a new PC solely for the purpose of watching HD movies off the internet. </s>
<s> What type of PC would I be able to buy at a reasonable price that has the capabilities I am looking for? </s>
<s> The reason I am doing this is to save money. </s>
<s> I have gone through 4 DVD players in a year and they keep breaking, I dont know why. </s>
<s> If buying a PC with all the components is going to cost an arm and a leg then that defeats the purpose. </s>
<s> If I can find one at a reasonable price than I will still consider it. </s>
<s> I bought this LCD TV assuming that it was going to have &quot;amazing quality picture&quot; but it is only slightly better than my other TV I bought over ten years ago. </s>
<s> A thousand dollars later, and I still have lower end of technology. </s>
<s> Sometimes I just feel like giving up. </s>
<s> I have never even downloaded a torrent before. </s>
<s> Is this idea even realistic? </s>
<s> There are a lot of computers on the market that already have HDMI on board, desk tops and laptops. </s>
<s> Check your local box stores such as Office Depot, they carry them, several other stores do as well. </s>
<s> You would be better off to do that than to try to pump up the old unit that you have. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> are you getting cheap, off-brand players? </s>
<s> the only dvd player that 'died' on me was a $40 phillips. </s>
<s> my toshiba and panasonic upconverting players are fine and they replaced dvd players that were 3+ years old but still working fine. </s>
<s> your TV's &quot;amazing picture quality&quot; will only be evident when it's dislaying a high-def source. </s>
<s> standard definition tv won't look that much better than a good 'regular' tv. </s>
<s> a $100 up-converting DVD player or $250 blu-ray player (like the samsung BD-P1500) will bring out your new TV's picture quality. </s>
<s> since your PC is very old, consider a laptop instead. </s>
<s> this toshiba is $800 and it will be faster than your old PC, handle HD content, and output a great image to your TV. </s>

<s> By the time you get done, you may as well get something that is set up to work, think it is a waste of time and money. </s>
<s> &quot;So I am better off just getting a new PC solely for the purpose of watching HD movies off the internet.&quot; Renting HD movies or just watching internet movie? </s>
<s> There are no hi-def. </s>
<s> movies on the internet. </s>
<s> What's wrong with the outdoor antenna? </s>
<s> i hooked up my LCD to my new gateway labtop via VGA. </s>
<s> The cable is from RADIO SHACK. </s>
<s> On the box it reads (1.8)-VGA/SUPER VGA MONITOR. </s>
<s> On the vable itself it reads 2919 80 degrees 30v Space Shuttle-C Low Voltage Cable. </s>
<s> I connected audio via 1/8&quot; STEREO MINIPLUG Audio Cable. </s>
<s> The samsung series 3 330 LCD TV says &quot;no signal&quot; when I select input_tv. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> if your TV has a VGA port all you may need is a $20 cable which can be purchased just about anywhere if your TV does not have a VGA port you can purchase a VGA TO S Video And Composite(Yellow Connection)At BJS.com for around $40.00 and then you can just use an s video cable which is just 18.00 but i got mine at a dollar store so look around </s>
