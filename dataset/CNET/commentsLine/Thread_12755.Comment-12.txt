you mentioned that all you use your isp for is email and as a gateway to the internet.
is there anything proprietary about the email service?
or is it standard pop3?
unless your access to the email server is restricted to only ip addresses issued by your isp, then you don't need to be using their connection.
another possibility is to ask if your isp's email can be accessed through a web interface from anywhere on the internet - such as if you were traveling and wanted to check your messages from the hotel connection.
instead of a hotel, though, you'll be coming across the internet from your wife's fiber isp.
i understand that the buffalo router can't handle multiple ip outside addresses, but i don't think you really need a direct connection to your isp in order to reach your email.
you can use the buffalo router to obtain an address from the fiber optic isp.
the three systems (your desktop, your laptop, and your wife's new system) will then each draw a private non-routable ip address from the router, and the router will manage all the translations between the 3 inside and 1 outside addresses.
we may need to sort out the exact method that your wife's network issues ip addresses (static or dynamic) and whether there is a logon of some sort embedded in her system.
hopefully those issues will be easy to put into the buffalo router configuration so that it will log onto the fiber optic isp.
