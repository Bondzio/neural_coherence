@ R. Proffitt Yes I understand how to insert a card once the computer is already in my house, what I am asking is how should I store the RAM (what kind of container should I use) to get it to the store.
Because right now the only thing I can figure is to use a ziplock or my bare hands (I don't trust aluminum paper...) @Willy Hold on, I wrote it down somewhere...&quot;One 512MB DDR400 PC3200U 184-pin RAM, and one 1GB of the same type.&quot;.
That's what was in my old Pentium IV when it died.
You're saying this type of RAM ISN'T interchangeable?
And I wouldn't be able to pop them into a new Pentium IV?
If I'm going to push up to 400$ I might as well wait for boxing day and see what deals show up then.
