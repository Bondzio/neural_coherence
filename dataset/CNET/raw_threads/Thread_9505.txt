Like using it for a dvd player for a tv. Something with the red, white, and yellow cables, not s-video. Sorry for not using all the techinical terms.

From Apple, you can get http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=75A42EE8&nplm=M9319G%2FA which allows and RCA (yellow-video equivalent) or S-Video connection out to a TV/monitor... http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E07A&nplm=M9321G%2FB which allows you to connect a DVI cable - if your monitor/TV can use that connection... http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=6C04E099&nplm=M9320G%2FA which allows a VGA connection more commonly found on computer monitors but finding its way onto many of the better flat-screen LCD and plasma panels. Audio will be a different cable... 1/8&quot; (3.5mm) stereo male out to whatever you want... Lots of sources for that, but here is an example http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=3F825B27&nplm=T4077G%2FA though this is only 1/8&quot;-1/8&quot; male-male... If there is a nearby RadioShack, they will have what you need... No worries on not using the technical terms - it was enough for me to understand - at least you didn't say &quot;that thingy&quot;...
