The only problem that could POSSIBLY come from is if the power supply unit the plugs your comp into the wall of your house may not be powerfull enough to run two hard drives at once.
I think that's bull.
Here is an idea, grab a CD Drive or hard drive from a friend's computer and see if your's still boots up with the extra load.
If not then so be it.
No harm will come from trying this.
The second hard drive may cuase your system to not boot but that can be remidied by?
Removing it of course.
The PSU will automatically shut down if it detects there is too greta of a load.
And if it does shut down then I would recommend getting a new PSU anyway.
