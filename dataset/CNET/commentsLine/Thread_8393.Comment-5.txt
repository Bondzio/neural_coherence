see, it's just that kind of talk (reveal if the dhcp address is valid) that makes me feel like an idiot!
i can only tell you at this point that if i open look at the za &quot;zones&quot; on the other three computers (yes, i have it installed on all of the systems) there is an &quot;adapter subnet&quot; that does, indeed, start with 192.168 they seem to be associated with the wireless adapters on those computers.
on the &quot;main&quot; computer (the desktop i have re-installed za on, and which is the one that is actually connected physically to the linksys) there is a listing for a realtec fast ethernet nic.
(could this be the built-in ethernet adapter?)
sorry i am such a dummy when it comes to networking stuff.
