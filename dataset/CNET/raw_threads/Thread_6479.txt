Wireless Ad Hoc Network	Hi and I would really appreciate your help on this I have a notebook connected to the internet through wired lan and I want to share this over the wireless lan to another notebook. Both notebooks have XP home SP2. The Host computer has the following: Wired lan (has ICS setting) IP: 10.0.15.*** Subnet Mask: 255.255.254.0 Gateway: 10.0.15.254 Wireless SSID(***) has been set to ad hoc with automatic IP and dns etc but shows as not connected Client setting Shows as connected to the SSID(***) with IP: 169.254.240.179 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 Gateway: 169.254.240.179 Now I don't know much but I definitely know that I shouldn't have the gateway as same as the clients IP and I'm thinking that the host should show connection... Any idea what I need to do?

If so, you simply bridge wired and wireless within that PC. You make that PC an AP for the wireless laptop. I don't think I can sort out our ICS settings. The gateway should definitely be the router's IP in any case. My old recollection of ICS was that the hosting PC needed 192.168.0.1 and the other addresses were to be within that range. XP could have changed that but I'm not sure. In any event, your wireless laptop needs to connect to something and, if the PC has both a wired and wireless NIC, the easy way is to bridge these and connect the laptop to that bridge. Hope this helps.

I just can't figure out why the host laptop won't show the connection whereas the client laptop will. I've tried bridging the connection but XP won't let me as the host laptop's wireless connection is not connected apparently...

Proffitt	6/19/08 6:18 AM	1.21385628E12	I used some hardware to do this	But if you must try it, firewalls, protection software must be set by you to allow all this and you can see if this article helps -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx I will not write at length here since ICS is now consider a tarpit. Not many escape so I don't go there anymore.
