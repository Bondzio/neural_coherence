<s> Can anyone tell me what the output will be if I add a 1 Watt amplifier to an Engenius EOC-3220 EXT Access Point? </s>
<s> Access Point 400mW Amplifier 1 Watt =1.4 Watt or only 1 Watt? </s>
<s> If I make a wireless bridge with 2 Engenius EOC-3220 EXT APs, 1 Watt booster on both APs, and 24db grid antennas. </s>
<s> Will that bridge work for a distance of 10-14 km? </s>
<s> Have a good line of sight. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> If they spot that, you don't want to know. </s>
<s> And the answer is... you have to try it. </s>
<s> No one will tell you it will work. </s>
<s> Also, pull back to 802.11b for the speed. </s>
<s> First, thank you Bob (Profit.M) for answering my question again. </s>
<s> Through the years I have often been glad to have you answer my questions. </s>
<s> I hope you get paid! </s>
<s> Concerning the WLAN, how strong can a Wireless Network be to be withing the regulations of the USA? </s>
<s> I am not in the US, but still would like to know to have an idea, and maybe use them here too. </s>
<s> Would you consider taking the amplifiers out of the plan for this network? </s>
<s> (Would it be a waste of money?) </s>
<s> Not expensive and worth trying for the few hundred bucks. </s>
<s> Remember that we'd hand make the antennas in our shop (we are engineers) so that's a zero cost item. </s>
<s> In the US if you interfere with others then the costs can be so high that you &quot;don't want to know.&quot; So what you noted is not done in populated areas and I must decline citing US regulations. </s>
<s> Let me try this again. </s>
<s> No one will tell you it will or will not work but I can give you the one important nugget and that you want to run it at 802.11b speed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
