clamping mechanism, [to me the brute strength seems a little bit of an overstatement] you'll find that the thermal grease/tape seems to have bonded the CPU.
Simply gently rotate the HSF a little in each direction and it will come free with no problem.
Of course to take the CPU you must gently depress the ZIF lever,move it outward a skosh and lift it up.
