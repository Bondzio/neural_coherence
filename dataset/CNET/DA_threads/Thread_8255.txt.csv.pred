1.1.1	Hi , When it comes to buying external enclosure ( for extra HDs ) should I be looking for something with cooling fan built in or should I buy something such as Mad Dog enclosure that claims ''Aluminum Housing for Optimal Heat Dissipation '' etc etc ?	Ques
1.1.2	Please help ! !	St
1.1.3	Oh !	St
1.1.4	... .	St
1.1.5	Many thanks in advance guys !	Polite
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	Recommend searching thru and reading the posts here as your question and others like it have been asked and answered numerous times .	St
1.2.2	You 'll also see what to avoid .	St
1.2.3	Bottomline , you can buy pre-built , prepackaged external HDDs with 1 year warranty or select separates of your choice .	St
1.2.4	The advantage to the latter is you choose the quality and characteristics of the components , both the enclosure and the hard drive .	St
1.2.5	The Adaptec ACS-100 is my choice as it handles HDDs up to 1,000GBs , has a one year warranty and is USB 2.0 .	St
1.2.6	The HDD I chose is a 320GB hard drive , the WD3200SB , has a 5 year warranty .	St
1.2.7	I just installed the WD3200SB HDD in the Adaptec ACS-100 and it was as easy and uneventful as when I put a 160GB Maxtor in another ACS-100 .	St
1.2.8	Good Luck on your search .	St

1.3.1	Thank you very much , VAPCMD .	St
1.3.2	That Adaptec looks totally awesome .	Polite
1.3.3	So I am guessing cool fan is n't all that important as long as the unit has that '' Heat Dissipation '' feature , correct ?	Ques
1.4.1	You 're Welcome The Adaptec enclosures seem to dissipate heat well ... so while a fan might help ... they do n't appear to be necessary .	St
1.4.2	The key is the enclosure is well constructed , it lets you see and use the entire drive capacity ( which many enclosure do n't ) and it 's comptable the systems you connect it to .	St
1.4.3	The specs on many enclosures do n't even address the maximum drive capacity in GBs .	St
1.4.4	Based on the posts I see here..there seem to be an unusually high number of Maxtor externals failing .	St
1.4.5	Ca n't tell from the posts whether it 's the drives or the enclosures themselves failing .	St
1.4.6	It certainly pays to handle them with care .	St
1.4.7	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	the customer comments on amazon say that the enclosure does not work with win2k .	St
1.5.2	Has anybody experience this ?	Ques
1.5.3	Do you know a fix ?	Ques
1.6.1	As I use such things with Windows 2000 SP4 .	St
1.7.1	I use Win2K on my home PC and at work .	St
1.7.2	I 've got 3 Adaptec enclosures : one ACS-100 with a 200GB Seagate the other with a 320GB Western Digital and an ACS-120 with a 2.5 & quot ; 100GB Seagate .	St
1.7.3	I 've had execellent results with the Adaptec ACS-100 as well as the ACS-120 and they handle hard disk drives up to 1,000GBs .	St
1.7.4	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I purchased an acs-100 and installed my hard drive .	St
1.8.2	On my win2k SP4 machine , I can turn on the hard drive and windows automatically detects external drive as a 'USB External Storage Device . '	St
1.8.3	When I try to 'stop ' the drive to do a safe disconnect/unplug , I select 'USB External Storage Device ' and click the 'stop ' button .	St
1.8.4	Then windows immediately restarts !	St
1.8.5	I tried the drive with my new winXP machine .	St
1.8.6	The drive is recognized my windows once I turn on the drive .	St
1.8.7	When I go to safe disconnect/unplug , windows says , 'the device is sitll in use . '	St
1.8.8	However , I have closed every window and application that I know of .	St
1.8.9	Any ideas why I am getting this weirdness ?	Ques
1.8.10	Any ideas where I can turn ?	Ques
1.8.11	I emailed adaptec customer support and they said that they do not provide tech support for that product only a hardware replacement .	St
1.8.12	I do not think it is the hardware , I think that I am having problems similiar to those list on amazon.com : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M3PGC/002-6292154-7416067 ? v=glance & n=172282 I do not have another external drive to test if it is the drive or if it is a windows problem .	St
1.8.13	Please help , I 'd appreciate any advice	Polite
1.9.1	I usually find an incomplete Windows install .	St
1.9.2	Many relied on Microsoft for drivers for the machine .	St
1.9.3	But since not a word about the machine , this discussion suffers an early end .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Do you think it is my machine ?	Ques

1.10.5	The winXP machine is new from dell , dell did the install .	St
1.10.6	I used the micrsoft drivers that windows suggested to pull down from the web .	St

1.11.7	Given so little information about the non-working machine , I ca n't help yet .	St
1.11.8	I wonder if it has USB 2.0 ports or if Windows 2000 has all it 's patches .	St
1.11.9	Bob	St
1.12.1	My windows 2000 machine had service pack 1 , I upgraded to service pack 4 just before I hooked up my external hd .	St
1.12.2	I downloaded the service pack from windows website .	St
1.12.3	Are there other patches that I need to install ?	Ques
1.12.4	Is there an easy way to find the correct patch that I need ?	Ques
1.12.5	The machine came with 2 usb1.1 ports but I recently installed a usb2.0 pci card to take advantage of my new drive 's usb2.0 connectivity .	St
1.12.6	I will try hooking the external hd to a usb1.1 drive .	St
1.12.7	As for the windows XP machine , it only has usb2.0 ports .	St
1.12.8	I did windows update a few days before I hooked up my external hd .	St

1.13.1	http : //www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Filemon.html It can show what programs access what files ( if any ) on the removable drive .	St
1.13.2	It might help to have such info .	St
1.13.3	Kees	St
1.14.1	I noted that the Windows 2000 machine ... You might share make , model , what type of USB ports and what drivers you installed after what Microsoft provided .	St
1.14.2	If the ports are only USB 1.1 , try an USB 2.0 PCI card .	St
1.14.3	Some drives do exactly what you noted on USB 1.1 ports .	St
1.14.4	Why not tell all ?	Ques
