<s> Hello, Thanks for taking the time to read this. </s>
<s> Bah! </s>
<s> Just got a new (well out in 2001 - it's an old system!) </s>
<s> game for my laptop to while away the Autumn nights, and the CD ROM has stopped working. </s>
<s> I have a Travelmate 230, with Mobile Intel Celeron CPU 2.00 GHZ, 256 MB Ram, Intel 82845G Graphics Controller. </s>
<s> The CD Drive was working fine a week or so ago. </s>
<s> I have recently uploaded several Windows Updates. </s>
<s> The CD Drive is now not working. </s>
<s> It says that the driver is missing or corrupted.I have tried all the trouble shooting methods to no avail, and the drivers I find on websites are only for IBM or Dell. </s>
<s> Can anybody help? </s>
<s> Also - is it worthwhile/possible to upgrade this laptop to play better/newer games? </s>
<s> Thank you in anticipation of any help. </s>
<s> The usual is the CODE 39 or such issue, but that's not a missing drive but a few registry keys we delete and the drive comes back. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It was when I followed the trouble shooting instructions. </s>
<s> I have cleaned the registry with a new tool lately (Eusing Free Registry Cleaner); if that is the case how can I delete the registry keys? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot by the way - I might be in Icewind Dale before the night is out! </s>
<s> I can't tell if this article will do the trick. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008/ Hint, just delete the upperfilters and lowerfilters, reboot... Bob </s>
<s> Oh. </s>
<s> I don't think so! </s>
<s> Should I go through what I have already done again before trying the link?Cheers for this, by the way - much appreciated. </s>
<s> Saves me time in the long run. </s>
<s> Your choice to investigate. </s>
<s> I'll try the other first if it won't do any harm. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> Bloody magic! </s>
<s> Cheers Bob! </s>
<s> It would be a trip to the boozer if you lived round here I can tell you! </s>
<s> Is there anything 'forum wise' I can do? </s>
<s> Anywhere to review help or anything? </s>
<s> As you can tell, I am VERY grateful! </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
<s> Best of continued luck. </s>

<s> I have a Toshiba Satellite A105-S4014 with a Matshita DVD-RAM UJ-841S. </s>
<s> The OS is XP Media SP2. </s>
<s> My Matshita worked fine for a long time. </s>
<s> Suddenly, it was no longer being recognized or was being discovered as new hardware and loading drivers. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it would show up as what it was supposed to, sometimes not. </s>
<s> It was always a garbled variant of Matshita DVD-RAM UJ-841S. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers to no avail and sought software conflicts with the same results. </s>
<s> I started thinking I had a bad/loose cable, so, with a nervous heart, I took my notebook apart. </s>
<s> I found no internal cabling problems. </s>
<s> Disappointed, I started putting it back together. </s>
<s> I had it almost completely reassembled, when I noticed something. </s>
<s> My DVD-RAM is held in the chassis by a single screw; no handy latches. </s>
<s> The screw hole only lined up with the DVD-RAM sticking out of the chassis about 1/16 inches. </s>
<s> I considered this to be far enough that the connection probably didn't seat properly with the screw in. </s>
<s> I pulled the device out of the chassis and took a look. </s>
<s> The screw that holds it in place goes through the bottom of the notebook case and into a tab that sticks out the back of the DVD-RAM. </s>
<s> I tweak the tab with a pair of pliers so that the screw hold would line up properly with the DVD-RAM seated completely in the chassis, and the connector would thus be seated properly. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> I am now very happy. </s>
<s> My Matshita is recognized and running at all times. </s>
<s> John S </s>
<s> The problem probably started with the CD tray getting bumped a few times while sticking out. </s>
<s> Beware. </s>
