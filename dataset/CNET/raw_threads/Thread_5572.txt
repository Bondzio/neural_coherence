Does anyone know what the power slot is for? I know that it's meant for an adaptor to be pluged into, but I though USB ports can provide power as well as transfer data. Just curious. I've had a drive for some time that has both and I've always just pluged the USB cable into the laptop. Thanks for any information you guys can give.

Some 2.5&quot; laptop drives in external enclosures can run off the power from one USB channel but for larger drives...probably 80GBs or 100GBs and above require power from 2 USB ports ...they have a &quot;Y&quot; cable and can also run off AC adapters too. Hope this helps.

I have searched all over the web and downloaded this and that but nothing seem to help. I even done a full system recovery but that didn;\,t didn,t help either. I,ll try this and see if it works.
