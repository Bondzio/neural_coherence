<s> The Athlon XP 2800 should be runnin at 2.8gig but is posting at 1245 and system properties also shows it at 1.24gigHz. </s>
<s> Seems I'm missing a change on the Mobo or something? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I would check that the BIOS is current, and see what the manual notes for jumpers (if any.) </s>
<s> The usual is that the settings are incorrect. </s>
<s> Since there was no make/model supplied, then you just need to read the manual on what to set for this CPU. </s>
<s> An out of date BIOS will mis-report the CPU so if you have such an issue, fix it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Athlon xp 2800+ doesn't mean 2.8 Ghz,. </s>
<s> That is misleading, it has to do with AMD benchmark testing. </s>
<s> Go to AMD.COM and look up your processor, it will tell you the actual speed of the processor. </s>
<s> Also Windows XP will correct the error in reporting in the processor speed and actually report the corect speed of the cpu. </s>
<s> Actually your Xp 2800+ should run at 2.083 gig if your multiplier is correctly set in your bios, and your front side bus is set at 333 megahertz. </s>
<s> My Xp 2600 + runs at 2.133gig with a front side bus of 266 Megahertz Check here for and update to your motherboard bios:(ftp.asus.com.tw) or (ftp.asus.com) or (ftp.asuscom.de) </s>
<s> You need to change a jumper setting on your motherboard and you can find this in the manual for your motherboard it will tell you what you need to have the setting on </s>
<s> correctly. </s>
<s> The multiplier for the XP's are FIXED [can't be changed without surgery]. </s>
<s> Thus you can only acheive 2.083 GHz when the FSB is set properly. </s>
<s> Many mobos have circuitry that drops the FSB back to a safe speed if you have a bad shutdown or it detects a problem. </s>
<s> The mobo mfrs/BIOS varies on whether you set the FSB to the single speed or the double speed. </s>
<s> Example 133 MHz or 266 MHz [an aspect of double data rate memory] the memory is clocked at 133 but it is read on both the leading and falling edge and thus reads at double the rate [266]. </s>
<s> Same for 166 and 333. </s>
<s> As already stated the AMD XP 2800 + actual clock speed is 2.083 GHz. </s>
<s> If it supports 166/333 MHZ memory the multiplier would be probably be listed as 12.5. </s>
<s> its running at 2.083 </s>
<s> you will need to go into the BIOS into the chipset selection and increase to a higher freq. </s>
<s> go to Ask Amd.com this will very helpful </s>
