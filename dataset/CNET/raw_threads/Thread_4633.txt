I'm buying a specially ordered Dell XPS 700 copmputer ONLY. Uses in order to me: 1. Gamer \ Workhorse &gt; {single person home user} 2. single person shooter games only on-line and off 3. 2 X 320 Raid 0 4. Windows XP Pro32 5. 2 gigs of Ram 6.***&quot;Hope to use for at least 3-4 years and still be&quot;in the game!?&quot; ______________________________________________________________________I am very limited in budget. I can afford up to $350.00 for a video card. I don't know the O.E.M. motherboard or real tech info from Dell except it is a special O.E.M. order. What ONE specific video card would you recommend?
