I feel it could be the graphics card, but need confirmation from you clever cnet-ers. A while ago (months) the pc loaded up and the screen is strange - where there is a dark box (such as the banner on this webpage) a dark shade continues from the edge of the banner, the width of the banner, to the edge of the screen. Wherever there is text, a faint dark strip extends from the text to the edge of the screen. I have tried the monitor in my laptop as an external screen, and it works fine. I have taken the ASUS AGP out and got the dust off, re-connected and still the same. Have you seen this before? What could be the problem. I dont have another graphics card to test, so I'd need to purchase one, but want to be sure it wont be a waste of money. Thanks for your time Andy
