<s> i just bought a razer deathadder. </s>
<s> i pluged it in, installed the drivers and was ready to go. </s>
<s> but i decided to update the drivers, so i downloaded the drivers from razers website and started updating. </s>
<s> during the middle of the update my computer crashed, before the update it told me that if the update was interrupted the mouse would be damaged. </s>
<s> now my mouse dosent respond, and only the scroll wheel lights up. </s>
<s> is there anything i can do, or do i have to buy another mouse. </s>
<s> and forget about updates. </s>
<s> As you've found, some updates do more harm than good. </s>
<s> As the old saying says, &quot;If it ain't broke. </s>
<s> . </s>
