i rarely go more than a year or so without updating something or other on my computer.
after a year, in my computer environment, the insides look &quot;pretty good&quot; but i usually blow fan blades and general interior areas clear of dust because there might be a harmful accumulation before i have occasion to open the case again.
sometimes, i have a tight build-up right on the leading edges of the fan blades which i scrape loose with a toothpick prior to blowing out.
i do not use unrestricted typical &quot;air compressor pressures&quot; (125 to 175 psi).
something like about 35 psi nozzle pressure is a good pressure.
you do want to do this outdoors, too.
i see a lot of people recommend vacuum cleaners for this cleaning operation, but i have not found them to be effective in removing the caked on dirt.
one note to those who have never seen a fan blade separate from excessive speed: do not........i repeat do not place an air nozzle real close to a fan blade and try to see how fast you can make it spin.
hold the fan blade from spinning with a popsicle stick or similar item while blowing compressed air on it.
