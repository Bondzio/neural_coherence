I am using WPA-PSK network auth, and AES encryption. My question is; with the Network SSID brodcast turned off, can any one using a scanner even see my network? Thanks, ~jdk

Since some systems start &quot;dropping wifi&quot; when this is off, my advice is as noted in our forum note. This is dated advice (turning SSID off) and it's time this information was updated. Bob
