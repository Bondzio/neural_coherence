All my prints carry a blue/cyan cast and are overly dark compared to my monitor no matter what printer settings I use.
I use Epson ink only.
I have adjusted all setting over an over, have completely replaced all ink cartridges and cleaned the heads multiple times.
I am using the Epson drivers.
The test print after cleaning appears good.
Ideas?
Thanks
