8255	0	595994	5471683	NR	zdrouse	6/27/13 6:51 AM	1.37231586E12	Will this wireless network card setup work?	I plan to add a wireless card to my desktop however I would like to cap the max (20 dbm) signal on the card. The card is listed below and comes with 3 2dbm antennas. http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-TL-WDN4800-Wireless-Express-Adapter/dp/B007GMPZ0A/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1D34L74W8U07B&coliid=I3QAQTO4G7E2VI I would like to purchase 3 of the below antennas that are 7 dbm (which would total 21 dbm together) http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-ANT24-0700-Omni-Directional-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B0007XXU3E/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1D34L74W8U07B&coliid=IP0YLEKH6GHBX Would adding 3 of the D-LINK antennas work with this setup while maxing out the signal strength of the network card?
