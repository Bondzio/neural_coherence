1.2.1	Everything we add generates heat .	St
1.2.2	You can get 20 Watts less for each hard disk and CD drive you remove from your design .	St
1.2.3	You can drop 10 or so Watts by cutting back to 512MB and today 's OS and games may run with a percentage point on the 1GB setup .	St
1.2.4	The dual display cards add too .	St
1.2.5	The lowest Wattage I see is about 35 Watts and you may have a 200 Watt CRT on that as well .	St
1.2.6	I see three to four hundred Watts you might be able to drop out of this system ( including CRT ) and still play the game .	St

1.3.1	You got all thos goodies stuffed into the system , you bet you 're generating heat .	St
1.3.2	Even with all those case fans , they still need to exhaust all the hot air , as some get stuck between HDs , CDs drives and such due to spacing , wire harnesses , and plain bad air flow .	St
1.3.3	Open the case and place a household fan to blow-in does it improve any ?	Ques
1.3.4	Also , the HSF , should be dusted/blown off to best allow the fins full heat disapation to work .	St
1.3.5	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
