I bought this product a few months ago and I have been presently surprised with how well it streams mp3's and jpeg's from a computer to my stereo and adjacent HDTV. The only downside is that it will not stream AAC/mpeg4 files. Accordingly, I have listed on eBay and I am going to get an iPod. My question is, does anyone know of a mp3 wifi streaming device that also supports AAC file formats?

A &quot;file&quot; is a file. If you can stream one file at so many bits per second, it matters not if it's a MP3 or other. What you may be writing about is the SOFTWARE PLAYER that came with the WMA11B. There are far too many legal issues with audio and video that Linksys may have had an issue with not getting a clear signal from patent holders to implement &quot;everything.&quot; Changing hardware is not the issue here.

Are you aware of where i could go to get some type of a &quot;software patch&quot; and/or upgrade that would allow me to stream the AAC format to the Linksys player? Linksys does not currently offer any available upgrade. In any case, if the hardware functions, I would imagine that eventually a &quot;software&quot; patch would be available. Alan

I'd look for a converter from AAC to an open standard like MP3 or better yet... OGG/Vorbis if that's supported. Your issue may be simply that you are NOT ALLOWED to play the AAC content on anything but what they let you. http://www.google.com/search?&q=aac+copy+protection finds discussions about this. And it backs up what I wrote about the software patent issues being most likely at the root of the problem. The lesson I learned when PROPRIETARY formats with such unfriendly encoding arrived was to not use or endorse such. Bob

After speaking with Linksys again this evening, they informed me that due to numerous requests from wma11b wireless media adapter customers, they are developing a solution that will enable AAC files to stream. It will involve firmware upgrade and a software upgrade for the computer that houses the files. It should be available within 6 months at the latest. Also, saw on one of the chatrooms postings from your google link, a website for a player called &quot;SlimMp3&quot; or &quot;Squeezebox&quot; which does utilize AAC in addition to mp3 formats ( http://www.slimdevices.com/ ). Thanks again for the help. alan
