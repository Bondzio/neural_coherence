1.1.1	Hey, I'm doing some light upgrading.	St
1.1.2	Do you guys know which one of these is better?	St
1.1.3	(Kingston SSDNow V+200 or A-Data S510) Both are 60GB.	St
1.1.4	I will be plugging them into my Gigabyte 990FXA UD3.	St
1.2.1	Since you only asked which is better that could mean by price or small file performance, big file performance, small or big file read write times or something else entirely.	St
1.2.2	I suggest you find some storage site review and maybe it's just the price.	St
1.2.3	HOWEVER if this is on an older than Windows 7 OS I'd not do this.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have a Kingston V+200 240 gig SSd on a Windows 7 computer and it is crazy fast and stable.	St
1.3.2	A friend tried that same model SSD on a Windows Vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble.	St
1.3.3	He did a clean install of Windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the SSD and cloned the harddrive to the SSD and it works great.	St
