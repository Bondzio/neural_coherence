using your: bios id string: 01/16/98-i430tx-ali5135-2a59itjac goto  and find the required match and then proceed to a support website.
while you mention the &quot;orginal&quot; support is no longer online, some friendly website many have your bios update.
also, beware to properly follow update procedure and whenever, save you're old bios info as a possible safe bet.
imho, if all this is too much, etc.
and since you're trying to update an old system, please understand in the long run you maybe too far gone as older mtrbds.
just don't cut it.
the pci2.1 complaintancy should be a build-in feature and not really a bios issue, other than what is possible.
in other words, if it doesn't work even after a bios update, there is no cure, just get a newer mtrbd.. good luck -----willy
