Remove &amp; reseat the RAM modules. If you didn't take anti-static precautions when handling the card or touching the other motherboard components, you may have damaged something by conducting static electricity through it.

Do the fans run and do you see any POST messages on the screen? Does your MB have on board graphics such that you can remove the video card and see if the PC boots?
