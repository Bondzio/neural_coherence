I've been told to use an ethernet transceiver cable. Anything else I need to do to make this work? Thanks

And, many of the files I need to transfer are large (graphic designer here.) I was wondering if there were any software settings I'd need to change if I went via cable.

Go get a FTP SERVER on your new mac. Now FTP the files over fast. This is not to offer a course on IP addresses and networking or FTP use. Bob

On the Quadra, turn on File Sharing and share the quadra hard drive, allowing access to everyone, including guests. Connect to that HD from the iMac and suck the files off of the quadra. P
