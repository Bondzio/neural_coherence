i have the same router as you.
i recently updated the firmware to version 1.52.02. you have to open the linksys configuration tool to do this.
save the file to your desktop and use the tool button that says update firmware to browse to your file on your desktop.
you can't just click on the file to update.
your enter the linksys tool just like you did when you set up your router.
enter admin in password (default) that said your problem may not be in the router.
it may be your ethernet connection.
set it to full duplex if you have it set to auto detect.
i would try the ethernet connection first.
the only difference i can tell in the firmware update on the router is it adds a gaming settings.
i have had my router for a couple years now and no problems.
i think it is a pretty good router.
