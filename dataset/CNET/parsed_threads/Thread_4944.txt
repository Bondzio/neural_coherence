<s> Whenever I try to access a my tablet PC running Windows vista 32-bit from my desktop running windows 7 64-bit I get a password prompt, however I cannot login with the login used on my tablet or my desktop. </s>
<s> I get the same problem if I try to access the desktop from my PC. </s>
<s> They are in the same workgroup and password protected sharing is off, what else could be causing this problem? </s>
<s> Do you have an account on that machine? </s>
<s> More issues are covered at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6127_102-0.html?threadID=381203&tag=forums06;forum-threads Yes you wrote password protected sharing is off but that does not mean you don't need an account on the other machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, I have accounts on both machines with administrative privileges. </s>
<s> The reason I am trying to access one another is so I can keep my music folder synchronized between the two using synctoy. </s>
<s> And be absolutely sure of firewalls, even the one in some routers. </s>
<s> I didn't see where you check that other link. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't see exactly how that can help me unless you are just trying to say that you can't help me with this? </s>
<s> I followed the steps on here http://www.tannerwilliamson.com/2009/09/windows-7-seven-network-file-sharing-fix-samba-smb/ and it still doesn't help. </s>
<s> You had completed the changes at that site. </s>
<s> This leaves us with firewalls (in any machine or router) and security suites too. </s>
<s> Yes, I can't help you. </s>
<s> I am not there to do all this for you. </s>
<s> There are quite a long list of things that can be wrong and what confounds some is why those that help can't just tell which item is wrong. </s>
<s> What works is if we keep going down the list. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I turned off both firewalls and still no progress. </s>
<s> I am not sure if the firewall of the network adapter could be causing problem, it is a Mac Time Capsule which I can guarantee is running the default settings. </s>
<s> What is next on the list? </s>
<s> Not a network adapter so something was lost in translation there. </s>
<s> Here's a Windows nugget. </s>
<s> Create the shares AFTER the accounts. </s>
<s> I've run into this oddity if the share was made and later I straightened out the accounts. </s>
<s> Since there is an Apple device, consider installing Bonjour from http://support.apple.com/downloads/Bonjour_for_Windows Bob </s>
<s> Is it possible to create accounts for different domains though, and if so how? </s>
<s> Also, time capsules are also wireless network adapters. </s>

<s> When makers rewrite the networking book we'll have to match the old names to what they write today. </s>
<s> That's a bridge mode and can harbor a firewall. </s>
<s> Domains are going to tax even the most season IT staff as the Domain Servers must be configured just so. </s>
<s> But I wonder if you have confused domains with workgroups? </s>
<s> If you have different workgroup names you have to correct that. </s>
