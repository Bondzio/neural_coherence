Hi, Pure MHz or GHz (the frequency) doesn't determine the speed of your CPU.
A few years ago, the practical limit of the frequency of CPU's was sort of reached.
At higher speeds, it becomes unstable, consumes too much power and effects like the slowness of the electricity signal in the chip (lightspeed) start to be a problem.
Dual core effectively doubles the speed of your CPU not by having twice the frequency, but by having twice the cores.
Also, RAM speed has increased, and RAM speed is the main bottleneck these days, not the speed of the CPU.
So basically CPU's now are more clean and power efficient, and yet much faster at calculating stuff.
