I have a 300w power supply on my computer and I have just recently added a Geforce 6600 GT.
It runs, but I have experienced glitching and stuttering in games.
The point is this: You likely won't damage anything by running your upgraded system with a small power supply, but you may experience glitching and crashing.
Just buy a new power supply, you can get a decent one pretty cheap.
