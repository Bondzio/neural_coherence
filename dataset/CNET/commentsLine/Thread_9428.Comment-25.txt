so far i have an aging computer; it's not as aged as many but there are some problems i dispise... namely the burnt-out ram slot on my 4-year-old motherboard.
the board is no longer manufactured, 2.0 ghz celerons are obsolete, as is my graphics card, a nvidia fx5200.
tbough i don't need a new pc right-out, i know what i will need.
i will probebly utilize new technologies, such as the mobile 64bit processors, and upgradable laptop graphics cards.
i also don't want some dull little notebook, so i'm choosing a more expensive, high-end manufacturer, alienware.
though many people avoid alienware, because of prices and bad reviews, remember they test the machine more than other companies will test their machines.
this leads to a more stable system, which is a very good thing!
however, i know my requirements for what i do, and i have calculated release times on new software based on past releases.
for example, the sims 2 was released in 2004, each ep about 9 monthes later.
however, the sims 1 was released in 1999. this leads me to believe that, if they stay on scedule, the sims 3 should be released by 2009. i'm going away to college in 2009, so it's a no-brainer that i choose to go with a less expensive xp machine, which i will keep for ubuntu linux when xp is obsolete.
also, remember popular release dates.
98se, very popular, was released in 1998, replaced totally by xp in 2004. that is a 6 year life.
xp is on year 3 right now, half through it's reign.
the choice is yours.
i explained how i came about mine.
