nah, i'm leaving here headed to tennessee and other parts in about an hour and wont see this for about two weeks.
in your defense though, she did make a few statements saying she didn't know what certain things was, and, came back later stating that she has been a writer for years.
if that be so, she should have been a bit better in her answers.
i'd have her uninstall all those cd/dvd programs first, clean out the register, reinstall the cd/dvd drivers, and that probably will take care of the problem with exception of being able to write cd/dvd.
it might even take care of that.
i don't personally like xp so haven't delved into it all that much.
i'd also stick to roxio easy cd/dvd creator.
