1.1.1	I have set a Wi-Fi network with a Desktop PC and a Laptop.	St
1.1.2	Both running on XP.	St
1.1.3	I have a printer connected to the Laptop and need to be able to print on it from the Desktop PC.	St
1.1.4	Both computers are on and running.	St
1.1.5	When I try to go through the Add a Printer Wizard it goes as far as recognizing the printer connected to the Laptop.	St
1.1.6	It gives me the name of the laptop and the name of the printer.	St
1.1.7	So I choose it and click on it.	St
1.1.8	This is where I hit a stumbling block.	St
1.1.9	A frame comes on that tells me is connecting to &quot;name of the Laptop&quot; and asks for a User Name and a Password.	St
1.1.10	I have tried the User Name and Password for the Laptop; it simply tells me Access denied.	St
1.1.11	I have tried as Administrator.	St
1.1.12	I have tried too the User Name and Password of the PC.	St
1.1.13	All instances same result.	St
1.1.14	I made sure the share a printer on the laptop printer is enabled.	St
1.1.15	Any suggestions to solve this problem will be appreciated.	St

1.2.1	The printer is shared with Full Control?	St
1.2.2	Go to the printer properties.	St
1.2.3	Add the Everyone group on the Security tab.	St
1.2.4	This should give access to the printer to umm everyone.	St
1.2.5	Setting up the printer... Go thru network places&gt;entire network&gt;microsoft networks&gt;your desktop machine name&gt;your printer share name.	St
1.2.6	Double-click the printer share and it should ask you if you want to install the printer.	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps.	St

1.3.1	would let you hang the printer on the network rather than on the laptop.	St
1.3.2	You would then be able to print from either computer withhout the other one being on.	St

1.4.1	I tried the permissions route but for some reason although it recognized the desktop PC it would not let it print.	St
1.4.2	Any way, after dickering with it for some days I accessed HP, the printer manufacturer, and presented the problem.	St
1.4.3	They directed me to download an specific wizard for that printer which I saved on a CD and ran on the Desktop PC.	St
1.4.4	It worked perfectly and now I can access printers back and forth between both computers.	St
1.4.5	Thanks for the input and help.	St

1.5.1	At the present time I could not get a wireless printer card.	St
1.5.2	Although I had though of that route to follow.	St

1.5.4	Thanks for your help and assist.	Polite
