VAPCMD PS...Did you look at the i860 ?

My only problem now is that the Radeon HD 5850 is over $350 on tigerdirect.ca for any of the versions they have.

Getting 140GB more disk space on a highly rated drive (including mine), with larger cache buffer (32MB vs 16MB), 5yr (Black) vs 3yr (Blue) warranty for $5.00 more makes a lot of sense to me. Good Luck on your system. VAPCMD
