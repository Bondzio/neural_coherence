Inspiron 1521 AMD Turion, 1.80 GHz 1918 mb ram Vista, Home Premium Zyxel P-330-W Router Cannon ip4300 Printer (on network) Yo!
Back again with my continuing saga of networking woes - some days good, some days not so good!
Newest issue is that if I want to print something on the laptop (using the networked Canon ip4300), it will only do so if I have recently rebooted or powered up the laptop.
If the laptop has been on for more than a few hours, the print command just doesn't seem to take - most of the time, if I open the active printer, the command hasn't even registered with the printer yet.
But if I restart Vista on the laptop, by the time my settings have loaded, the document I was trying unsuccessfully to print will have finished printing!
There's obviously some conflict at work here, or some setting I've overlooked - any suggestions?
I'm getting closer to having this thing working properly - I can feel it!
Thanks for your response, john
