<s> I am in the process of planning my first build and I could use some help. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer, but I will be using my PC primarily video editing and encoding. </s>
<s> I do not need lots of serious mod components (water cooled, neon fans, etc) nor do I plan to overclock in the immediate future. </s>
<s> I could find lots of info on CPUs, motherboards, video cards, etc that has helped me make my choices there. </s>
<s> However, there are so many types of cases, from super cheap to super expensive, I'm not sure where to start. </s>
<s> I don't need any of the serious extras (neon lights, acrylic cases, windows, etc. </s>
<s> ), but I don't want a generic whitebox either. </s>
<s> As far as the PSU, how much power is really needed? </s>
<s> Are the PSUs that come with cases often junk? </s>
<s> Should I try to purchase these components separately? </s>
<s> Here is a summary of my future build so far: - AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Winchester Integrated into Chip FSB Socket 939 Processor Model ADA3200BIBOX - Retail ~ $190 - MSI K8N NEO2 PLATINUM Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce3 Ultra ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail ~ $128 - ATI ALL-IN-WONDER 9600 100-714116 ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600 128MB DDR AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail ~ $137 - CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB (2 x 512MB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 (PC 3200) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model VS1GBKIT400 - Retail ~ $80 - NEC 3520A DVD Burner ~ &lt;$50 - Case ???? </s>
<s> - PSU ???? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> If video editing and encoding, you got to go with intel!!!! </s>
<s> What is your budget. </s>
<s> Ill help u with a list of parts to look at. </s>

<s> My suggestion to downgrade the processor,ram, no monitor/speakers/wireless kybrd&Mouse. </s>
<s> Also get a regular 400Watt PSU FOR HALF the price. </s>
<s> Why exactly is Intel better at video editing/ encoding? </s>
<s> something about pipelines being narrow and wide or something....? </s>
<s> what is a pipeline? </s>
<s> You're thinking too much. </s>
<s> There isn't as much a difference between Pentium and AMD as some of these hardcore games would like you to think. </s>
<s> The speed gap for different tasks are actually very small anyway, and makes no real difference in the end. </s>
<s> If you find a good deal on AMD processors, don't just ignore it because Pentium is supposed to be faster at video compression/decompression. </s>
<s> And another thing, don't get an extra sound card. </s>
<s> Some of these Creative cards cost around $200! </s>
<s> Comeon! </s>
<s> It makes absolutely no difference if you're editing digital audio or video. </s>
<s> Actually, it makes no difference even if you're just listening to it... </s>

<s> inability to solve their power consumption problem in the P4's. </s>
<s> They refuse to talk about it. </s>
<s> When AMD went from the 130 NM chips to the 90 NM chips the power went down from 80 some watts to about 67 watts. </s>
<s> The Intels dissipation didn't go down one Iota. </s>
<s> Notice that the Intel dual core using 2 P4's can't run at the speed that the one P4 could, simply because it consumes too much power. </s>
<s> There's a great article in Tomshardware giving details. </s>
<s> The Intel at idle consumes as much power as the dual AMD at peak. </s>
<s> The socket 939 will support the Dual for future upgrade. </s>
<s> The dual Intel will require a different chipset. </s>
<s> I wonder if the slight superior video editing performance warrants forgoing the gains one gets with the AMD 939 Winchester. </s>
<s> Not saying that you are wrong, simply food for thought. </s>
<s> Maybe dragon will straighten him out. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If your main interest is Video then get the AMD64 Venice core since it will handel the SS3 instruction set, same as the P4 processor. </s>
<s> On rendering test the P4 if faster by a few seconds and the credit is given to the SS3 instrucion set and now AMD has it. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> These rendering tests are huge. </s>
<s> In the real world, the difference would be in the milliseconds instead of seconds. </s>
<s> So it doesn't matter in the end. </s>
