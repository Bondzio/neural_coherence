<s> Hi I have recently acquired a Power Mac G4 using OSX which has a SCSI card installed in one of the PCI slots. </s>
<s> I have a very reliable Agfa scanner(Snapscan 310) which is over 10 years old but has always given me excellent quality and I'm reluctant to replace it. </s>
<s> Even though I've re-installed the software from the original Agfa installation disk, every time I try to use the scanner through Adobe Photoshop in Classic mode, a message pops up asking me to turn on the scanner which of course it already is!! </s>
<s> Does the fault lie with incompatibility between the scanner and the SCSI card or the Agfa software and the G4 or am I missing something blindingly obvious? </s>
<s> Thanks Eric </s>
<s> If you can, see how the scanner responds when you try to access it. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Appreciate the suggestion, but through trial and error I have since discovered that the SCSI card was the problem, OSX wasn't recognising it. </s>
<s> All sorted now thank you. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
