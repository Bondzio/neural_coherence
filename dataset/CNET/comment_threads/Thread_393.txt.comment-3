There are folk that use dumps and such but you won't find me looking at them when you spot the usual failing card.
I rip the card out and try another.
This is not to say that's it but given the clues it's my next move.
-&gt; I can't see the PC so I can't see how clean it is.
That is, we also see this with clogged heatsinks and old heat sink compound.
If anything is over 2 years old we pull all the heatsinks (one at a time) to wipe off the old and apply new compound.
I'm sure you know this drill.
