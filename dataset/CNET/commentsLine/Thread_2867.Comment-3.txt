thanks, bob.
i am booting knoppix off of a dvd, and it does in fact see the drive and can access the data.
forgive me fo not being a linux user, but i cannot transfer the data between drives.
i believe it because i do not have write privileges.
i've tried changing up permissions, but i do not know the root password.
are you aware of a default?
thanks for the help to date.
