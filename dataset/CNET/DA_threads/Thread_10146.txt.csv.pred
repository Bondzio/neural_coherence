1.1.1	Hi , I 'm about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in Industrial Engineering .	St
1.1.2	Every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new MacBook but I ca n't help but wonder if a PC would be much more suitable for my studies .	St
1.1.3	I 'll be using the laptop mainly for music , movies and work .	St
1.1.4	So , Mac or PC ?	Ques
1.2.1	what programs you will absolutely have to use for your course .	St
1.2.2	Then check to see if there is a Mac equivalent .	Sug
1.2.3	If there is , go get a Mac .	St
1.2.4	If there is n't , go get a Mac , load Boot Camp , load Windows and only use it for that one , absolutely have to use , Windows program .	St
1.2.5	The rest of the time , enjoy OS X Would that be the MacBook or the MacBook Pro ?	Ques
1.2.6	P	St
1.3.1	Yup , took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link , http : //www.cae.wisc.edu/site/public/ ? title=onetoone and by telling me that the engineering department runs Windows and Unix machines .	St
1.3.2	Sorry but I 'm a ( soon to be ) first time Mac user , should n't a Mac be able to work since its based on Unix ?	Ques
1.3.3	Anyways , as mrmacfixit asked , I think it 's going to be the 2Ghz MacBook and I 'll throw in my own 2GB of ram .	St
1.4.1	that the Productivity software is MS Office .	St
1.4.2	Available as Office 2004 for Mac , Student & Teacher edition ( $ 125 ) has everything except MS Access .	St
1.4.3	Check out the On Line Software Catalog , they sell Mac stuff !	St
1.4.4	Also note that their & quot ; recommended & quot ; computer purchase is a Windows box .	St
1.4.5	The fact that the engineering department runs UNIX machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run Unix .	St
1.4.6	I am not aware of a UNIX/Windows dual boot machine , Bob will comment if there is , but you have an advantage as your Mac has a form of UNIX already , if you actually need a UNIX machine .	St
1.4.7	Your lovely new 2GHZ Macbook will do admirably and , with Boot Camp , will even run Windows .	St
1.4.8	Good luck P	Polite
