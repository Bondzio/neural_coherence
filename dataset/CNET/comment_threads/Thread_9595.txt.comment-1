hi i just made a new system with the following: .intel p4 3.4ghz .Asus P5WD2-PREMIUM I955P PENTIUM D 4xDDR2 Raid PCI-EX GLan LGA775 .DDR2 512MB CM2X512A-5400UL XMS2 .Western Digital 160G SATAII 7200 rpm HDD .zalman copper heatsink fan.
.4 case fans cpu runs at about 57 degrees celcius, my case is a antec p180, but for some reason really slow boot???
sometimes my pc hangs once the 1st bios screen loads its the newest bios available but still takes well over a minute to boot up and load windows and msn messenger any ideas on how to boot faster?
?
