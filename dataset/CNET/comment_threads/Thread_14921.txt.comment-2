but you have not mentioned which iBook your colleague has, or what version of the Mac OS it is running.
If, on removing the RAM, the machine functions normally, I would suspect that the RAM was faulty.
Pass on a little more information and we'll go from there.
BTW, most RAM from reputable companies is warranted for life.
