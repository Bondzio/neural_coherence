<s> I currently own the ATI Radeon 7200 that is PCI card Now I was wondering that is this card going to be better than the Intel 3D Direct AGP that is 32mb? </s>
<s> The onboard Intel video chip is using the AGP 2X bus instead of PCI bus. </s>
<s> I did look at the speed specs for AGP 2X and I noticed that the AGP 2X transfer speed is: 533 MBps and clock rate is 133 MHz. </s>
<s> PCI cards are only 132 MBps and 33 MHz or 133 MHz. </s>
<s> As you see the transfer rate for AGP 2X is alot faster than PCI so I thought my onboard Intel AGP will be overall still better than the Radeon 7200 PCI card. </s>
<s> By the way both the onboard Intel video chip and Radeon 7200 have 32mb of video ram. </s>
<s> I think the onboard video chip is connected to the north bridge so that's why it is using AGP. </s>
<s> Here are specs of my motherboard. </s>

<s> Please don't compair these video adapters to todays since I know todays are better. </s>
<s> I just want to compair the two. </s>
<s> At almost any benchmark. </s>
<s> Sorry if I don't vet or research this again. </s>
<s> It's been done before so I'll just leave it at that. </s>
<s> Sorry if this offends anyone. </s>

<s> I did find out that my onboard AGP video is the same as the Intel740. </s>
<s> Now will the Intel740 be better since it's an AGP 2X instead of PCI? </s>
<s> The Radeon 7200 I have is a PCI version so the bus isn't as fast as if it were AGP. </s>
<s> But I needed to know is that since my motherboard can only take PCI type cards will the Intel740 AGP 2X be better than the Radeon 7200 PCI? </s>
<s> I remember the 740. </s>
<s> Almost anything beats it. </s>
<s> Again I will in this case defer to my older brain cells for reference. </s>
<s> These are not online today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So even the bus is alot slower on the Radeon 7200 that I have it will still perform alot better than an Intel740 that is AGP 2X? </s>
<s> What I basicly thought was that any AGP cards will beat PCI cards since like AGP 2X is 533 MBps and PCI cards are 133 MBps. </s>
<s> There is a difference you know. </s>
<s> If the Intel740 had AGP 8X then that would even be faster and better than Radeon 7200PCI right? </s>
<s> If there are others that are looking at this topic please reply back if you know about this. </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> By you asking multiple times I take it you want me to vet my answer. </s>
<s> Today I won't be doing that. </s>
<s> I will however share my experiences with that old gear. </s>
