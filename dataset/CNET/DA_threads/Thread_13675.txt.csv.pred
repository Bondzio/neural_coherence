1.1.1	Hey, guys.	St
1.1.2	I have a Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 in my computer that isn't being recognized in Device Manager.	St
1.1.3	I therefore am forced to use the Intel 4K graphics.	St
1.1.4	I have gone into the BIOS and set the computer to read the PCI slots first, but this was unsuccessful.	St
1.1.5	How do I get my GPU recognized, and how do I enable it to be the default graphics setting?	Ques
1.1.6	Installing drivers has not worked either.	St
1.2.1	I only have the clues you provided so these are likely incorrect.	St
1.2.2	1.	St
1.2.3	Install the latest BIOS.	St
1.2.4	2.	St
1.2.5	Connect the PSU lead if required to the GPU card.	St
1.2.6	3.	St
1.2.7	Ask the PC maker if they know of any card compatibility issues.	St
1.2.8	4.	St
1.2.9	Fit a PSU double the size for a test run.	St
1.3.1	video.	St
1.3.2	Save the change and reboot Then make sure the monitor is cabled to the new video card and restart the PC VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I tried doing this in the BIOS, and now all I get is a black screen when I boot.	St
1.4.2	What's wronggggg?	St
1.5.1	If yes, did you connect it ?	Ques
1.5.2	How about you PSU.....exactly which one (PSU) do you have ?	Ques
1.5.3	How are you connecting to the monitor...via the VGA or DVI connector ?	Ques
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Yes, I connected the PCI express cable from the power supply to the graphs card.	St
1.6.2	I have an Antec High Current Gamer 620 W PSU.	St
1.6.3	I'm connecting to the monitor throughout DVI.	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	It's connected via DVI.	St
1.9.1	use the DVI input or the VGA input ?	Ques
1.9.2	In my monitor manual it says: Selecting the Signal Connectors and Cables The monitor features two DVI-I connectors capable of supporting either analog or digital input.	St
1.9.3	The video mode supported by the DVI-I connector is determined by the video cable used.	St
1.9.4	- For digital operation, use the DVI-D signal cable provided.	St
1.9.5	Connect the DVI-D signal cable to a DVI-I connector on the monitor and the other end to the DVI connector on the computer.	St
1.9.6	- For analog operation, use the DVI-I to VGA signal cable provided.	St
1.9.7	Connect the DVI-I to VGA signal cable to a DVI-I connector on the monitor and the other end to the VGA connector on the computer.	St
1.9.8	The monitor will automatically determine which inputs have valid video signals.	St
1.9.9	The inputs can be selected through the On-Screen Display (OSD) feature by pressing the Input Select button on the front.	St
1.9.10	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	Alright, my monitor is working completely fine.	St
1.10.2	I just need the computer to recognize the video card.	St
1.11.1	multitude of possibilities without the benefit of being there and knowing the things you've tried.	St
1.11.2	If you're sure the GPU is fully seated, you've tried it in another slot (if any) and it's not working, do you have another PC you can try it in?	St
1.11.3	BTW ...what MB or system is this going in ?	Ques
1.11.4	VAPCMD	St
1.12.1	My motherboard is the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H,	St
1.13.1	The story is too light so far.	St
1.13.2	The full rundown of both the story, the machine is not here so there's a lot of guessing going on.	St
1.13.3	I wonder if mr-stat is getting frustrated?	St
1.13.4	Bob	St
1.14.1	Did you try the new card in one of the other PCIe slots ?	Ques
1.14.2	Do you have another GPU to try ?	Ques
1.14.3	Now that we know the MB...how is the BIOS set ?	Ques
1.14.4	Init Display First: Specifes the frst initiation of the monitor display from the installed PCI graphics card, PCI Express graphics card, or the onboard graphics.	St
1.14.5	- Auto Lets BIOS automatically configure this setting.	St
1.14.6	(Default) - IGFX Sets the onboard graphics as the first display.	St
1.14.7	- PEG Sets the PCI Express graphics card on the PCIEX16 slot as the first display.	St
1.14.8	- PCI Sets the graphics card on the PCI slot as the first display.	St
1.14.9	Internal Graphics: Enables or disables the onboard graphics function.	St
1.14.10	(Default: Auto) VAPCMD	St
1.15.1	My PC runs completely fine, except that I want to get use out of my GPU and not use Intel's onboard graphics.	St
1.15.2	I do not have another GPU, and if I tried installing the 7950 into another PCIe slot, it would interfere with things like sata ports because the card is so big.	St
1.15.3	The BIOS is set to default settings, because I had to clear cmos.	St
1.15.4	I tried disabling the onboard graphics in the BIOS but this just led to a black screen.	St
1.15.5	I'm thinking it's just a faulty card.	St
1.16.1	At this point, I'm looking at other 7950 variants to purchase like this one: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7950twinfrozr3gd5oc	St
1.17.1	Sadly, my 7950 has never worked.	St
1.18.1	Time to get it tested or just exchange it.	St
1.19.1	Too bad we couldn't fix the problem, but oh well.	St
1.19.2	Do you all like this card?	St
1.19.3	http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7950twinfrozr3gd5oc	St
1.20.1	That card is on the list at tomshardware and you must be sure to have the power to drive it.	St
1.20.2	Bob	St
1.21.1	buyers are reporting on the cards in question.	St
1.21.2	Here's a link to GPUs based on the 7950 chipset available at Newegg and how they're rated by the buyers.	St
1.21.3	You can ignore the ones that downrate the product because of reasons not pertaining to the card itself.	St
1.21.4	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100006662&IsNodeId=1&Description=7950&bop=And&Order=RATING&PageSize=20 Personally I seems a little like a crap shoot...as some arrive DOA, some die after just a few moments and others are just perfect.	St
1.21.5	At least this gives you some info about the products available from different mfgs based on the 7950 chipset.	St
1.21.6	I too have been looking for a GPU update but there are so few cards which are consistently rated 5 or 4 which is a sad commentary on product manufacturing QC.	St
1.21.7	All things considered such a high-end purchase might be better made locally vice the net.	St
1.21.8	In the event it doesn't work...you just return or exchange it for one that is working.	St
1.21.9	Let us know how it works out.	St
1.21.10	VAPCMD	St
