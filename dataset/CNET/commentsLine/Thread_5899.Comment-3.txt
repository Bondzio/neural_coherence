would the port be located on the motherboard?
it is a 2y832.
i've had this thing apart several times and don't recall seeing a sata cable, but if i could plug in to the motherboard i'll do that and save the converter for something else.
also, can i use the cable from the old cd player.
i believe it is sata and does'nt work anyway.
in doing this, how would i change setup?
