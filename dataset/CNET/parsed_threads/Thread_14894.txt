<s> Hi all, This morning, much to my horror, my computer did not want to boot up! </s>
<s> I could hear the fan running, but nothing was booting. </s>
<s> Well, I sorta take that back--one of my attempts at restarting caused it to try booting up from the cd drive, but that only happened once. </s>
<s> After that, all I heard was the fan coming on, but nothing else happened. </s>
<s> After some frustration and venting, a friend suggested a strange alternative--turn it on, do a hard-dump to turn it off (that is, hold the power button to turn it off), and then hit the power again, before the fan completely shuts off. </s>
<s> Lo and behold, that somehow worked!! </s>
<s> I've had the PC on all day today since then, doing some VERY important copying of files to my externals and elsewhere, just to be safe. </s>
<s> Everything looks to be running fine--no audio or video card problems, no processing issues, no stickiness of the system overall. </s>
<s> In fact, this is the first time this has happened. </s>
<s> So my question is: I'm pretty sure this unconventional way of turning it on is NOT the best and safest of ideas, so does anyone have any idea what caused this? </s>
<s> My friend suggested it might be a faulty power supply, or a faulty motherboard...I just want to hear from some others here to make a decision on where to go next. </s>
<s> I will also add that I use this desktop primarily for writing and internet purposes. </s>
<s> I'm not a gamer, so I'm not too worried about wanting/needing an upgrade to faster processing time. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> by cleaning out the case if it is dusty inside. </s>
<s> Yes, it could be a dying power supply. </s>
<s> Hello, I own an emachines t3418 as well and have worked on dozens over the years, seeing as emachines is a &quot;budget&quot; system builder they include some cheaper parts which lead to hardware failure. </s>
<s> The one I have noticed the most is power supplies, I would highly recommend you replace the factory psu they are cheap and will greatly extend the life of the system, the older machines especially. </s>
<s> I have bought and found many p4/celeron era emahiches all with dead psu's and dead motherboards </s>
