<s> I have recently purchased a Sony DVD RW DW-U18A and haven't succesfully burned one DVD yet! </s>
<s> The burn process fails at the last 10% or so (I can't remember the exact error message, but it entails 'failed'). </s>
<s> I have tried burning a DVD (mixed data, film, audio) with the most recent Nero and Alcohol and yet it still fails. </s>
<s> I have tried looking for updated drivers for the DVDRW but they don't seem to exist...help!!! </s>
<s> I am running WinXP. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You are right. </s>
<s> No drivers. </s>
<s> None are required. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You didn't say if you tried with the software they supplied. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Try it with the IMAPI service disabled. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> XP? </s>
<s> SP2? </s>
<s> All the drivers have been updated? </s>
<s> (Tip: Microsoft doesn't do this!) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 1.OK 2.I wasn't supplied any software with it 3.How do I disable the IMAPI and what does this do? </s>
<s> 4.Not installed SP2 as I believe at the moment it causes more problems than it cures </s>
<s> &quot;I can't remember the exact error message&quot; Knowing the error message would be a big help. </s>
<s> When burning 1. </s>
<s> Slow down the write speed to 1/2 the default 2. </s>
<s> Walk away from the system while burning Other thoughts 1. </s>
<s> Not as bad with Xp but possible, Incompatable memory chips. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Check for spy-ware/virus 3. </s>
<s> Quality of disk 4. </s>
<s> Capacity of disk 5. </s>
<s> Do Nero and Alcohol play nice together? </s>
<s> 1.OK 2.I wasn't supplied any software with it Big mistake. </s>
<s> What many find out is they get laughable support on bare drives. </s>
<s> If it was mine, I'd make sure the FIRMWARE is uptodate and see if DVDSHRINK works with it. </s>
<s> 3.How do I disable the IMAPI and what does this do? </s>
<s> I do not hold hands. </s>
<s> You would type XP IMAPI into google.com 4.Not installed SP2 as I believe at the moment it causes more problems than it cures Your choice. </s>
<s> And this may sound bad, but I move quickly to update all drivers, firmware and the OS so I know I'm stable. </s>
<s> You haven't. </s>
<s> You picked up a bare drive and that means you are an expert or have great support systems. </s>
<s> I've shared what I would do and you have to decide what to do next. </s>
<s> Let me be blunt. </s>
<s> You may eventually find out what's wrong, but without latest firmware, drivers and SP2, I leave you to figure it out. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Yeah thanks for that Mr Proffitt; I can't help noticing that on most of your replies to peoples questions (including mine) you treat them as imbeciles when all they are doing is asking for a little help. </s>
<s> Maybe it's time for you to hang up your keyboard and do something less stressful as your highly paid/high pressure job seems to be taking its toll, hahaha! </s>
<s> &quot;I've shared what I would do and you have to decide...I leave you to figure it out.&quot; Cheers </s>
<s> Your last reply did not supply any feedback if dvdshrink worked or not. </s>
<s> As to your ire, you should direct it to the friendly people that took your money. </s>
<s> I pull all the NASTY problems up on the table for discussion. </s>
<s> Some will not want to hear that a bare drive is trouble for most owners. </s>
<s> Get over it and let's whip this drive into working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks mate. </s>
<s> I've put burn speed down to 2, but still problems. </s>
<s> I've walked away whilst burning many a time!! </s>
<s> hahaha! </s>
<s> I've checked for virus/spyware etc and &quot;i'm clean&quot;. </s>
<s> Quality of disk - they're Datawrite Yellow V2. </s>
<s> Capacity of disk - 4.76gb. </s>
<s> I've never had conflicts of any sort with Nero or Alchohol both being installed. </s>
<s> Apologies if I did sound irate, but i'm sure you can understand why people get shirty, especially if they're not as technically offay as some. </s>
<s> I'll check DVDShrink out. </s>
<s> You've been taken a little advantage of by the person/place that took your money, gave you a bare drive and tossed in the deep end of the pool. </s>
<s> It's not funny. </s>
<s> And while you can beat me up, I have to pull all the dirty items up on the table so we can work the issues. </s>
<s> It would be interesting if DVDSHRINK was able to dupe and make a good DVD since that points to updates needed in Nero/other or even a FIRMWARE update. </s>
<s> These bagged drives are for OEMs that update the firmware and more... Bob </s>
<s> As to Bob's question to you about Nero and Alcohol working together, I think(just listening to people that use them together) the answer is sometimes. </s>
<s> DVDShrink and Nero work very well together. </s>
<s> Another factor you might consider. </s>
<s> DVD burning (more so than CD) reinstituted the old problem of media compatibility. </s>
<s> You have to find what media works best on your machine(mine doesn't like Sony) and then pick out the good quality from that list. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Thanks Chuck. </s>
<s> Hiya Rob I tried DVDSHRINK and the burn failed (again, at the 'lead out' part of the disc...so close, so close!!!). </s>
<s> From what I gather searching on the web, Sony use other peoples drives and rename them as Sony...possibly why I can't find any firmware updates etc... </s>
<s> The DW-U18A see discussions like this... &quot;only use discs that the writer does like. </s>
<s> The solution here is to stop using the DVD-R discs that don't work. </s>
<s> A firmware update probably will not help you because your current firmware is not old enough to be significantly improved upon by a firmware update.&quot; 1. </s>
<s> Are you using DVD-R? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Did it ever work? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> With what make/type media? </s>
<s> 4. http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/114504 looks like you are not alone. </s>
<s> I'd get another model, but do try DVD+RW or DVD-RW until you sort it out. </s>
<s> Have you been talking to the supplier? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks, i'll give the salient points a try and let you know how I get on. </s>
<s> If you do not have USB 2.0 installed try burning at 4X speed. </s>
