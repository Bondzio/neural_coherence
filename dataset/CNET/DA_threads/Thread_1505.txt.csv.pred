1.3.6	Check Amazon.com and Tigerdirect.com for competitive prices .	St
1.4.1	Check out the HP 1600/2600 series .	St
1.4.2	I took the 2600tn and love it .	St
1.4.3	Printing 50 full color/photo flyers is quick , easy and cheap on toner .	St

1.5.1	Hi , if you want photo print quality , you need a hi-res colour inkjet - I 'd recommend Epson or Canon - I have an Epson R200 - superb printer .	St
1.5.2	For flyers , business cards , etc. , I 'd suggest a low end colour laser , the quality will be just fine and the consumables are way cheaper .	St
1.5.3	I 'd suggest a model from the HP 2600 or 3500 series .	St
1.5.4	Lasers are better suited to duplex printing , IMHO .	St
1.5.5	Both these series have a duty cycle appropriate to Small Office / Home use .	St
1.5.6	The only snag is they are a bit bulky and they were n't designer to handle heavy business duty cycles .	St
1.6.1	You really do n't want to be printing business cards and newsletters with any water based ink jets - they may look OK , but the ink runs and smears .	St
1.6.2	I purchased a Dell 3100cn ( color laser ) about a year ago .	St
1.6.3	Duplex is available although optional .	St
1.6.4	This printer has been jam free , does a high-quality for both photos and type , and as economical as it gets .	St
1.6.5	I 've duplex everything from vellum to card stock with no problems .	St
1.6.6	I 've worked with the HP color lasers and Xerox during the last few years and find the Dell to be superior for the photos and as good as or better on text .	St
1.7.1	I have been using a Oki color laser , doing cards flyers ect .	St
1.7.2	for our local bowling club , table tops and other small print items .	St
