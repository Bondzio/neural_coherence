and have made just about every mistake one could make.
i'm sure you've looked into the t-568a and b schemes may have noted some variances in which colored pairs are used in some cat5 that still works.
as well, if testing, you can't just to the xmit rcv pairs because the non-used ones must also be connected and connected properly.
if you've done your own punch downs for the wall outlets, you will want to pay very close attention if they show both the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; schemes.
you'll want &quot;b&quot; and don't think you can just lay them straight across like what you'll see in the cable ends as these are designed to minimize the amount of untwisting you need to do....and do keep the untwisted wire as short as possible.
if you have a dvm, it's real easy to make a loopback connector to check cable continuity yourself rather than use your tester.
that could be a good way to get a second opinion.
i've got one i need to check myself in a school i wired where the connection at the switch shows a 10mb rather than 100mb connection.
it's about 150 foot run from a room outlet to a patch panel and i'm suspecting one of the unused wires might have become detached at one end and hoping it's not due to a mouse bite somewhere in the ceiling.
