i look at such laptops and find 300 cycle batteries so in about 1 year that 11 hours usually is 1/2 that if the owner is charging the battery at night and using it on battery during the day!
and if this is so important why not install xp yourself?
in fact, i have begun to cycle out all old xp machines from the office.
can't imagine keeping xp around with all the good stuff we have in 7 today.
and no.
we don't have any title or hardware we found to &quot;require xp.&quot; bob
