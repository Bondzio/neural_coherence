<s> I had burned a DVD with some important files. </s>
<s> But, the problem is now it doesnot show these files at all. </s>
<s> Though it says that it occupies 2.38 GB of 4.38 GB, there are no files at all. </s>
<s> Ho can I view these files. </s>
<s> Please help me as these files are very important for me. </s>
<s> If I use some DVD media as a drive software then when I take this DVD to another machine the files are missing. </s>
<s> Back to the machine I created it on and my files show. </s>
<s> Why is that? </s>
<s> It happens because the machine that it worked on has special drivers (called filters) that enable use to see and write to the DVD media as if it was a slow hard drive. </s>
<s> I discourage use of such titles for the very reason you posted. </s>
<s> If you can supply the title of software you used or if you used the native OS feature we can look into how to get at the files on other PCs. </s>
<s> For now you can look up ISOBUSTER and see if it sees the files. </s>

<s> Sometimes DVD Writer media is not accepts DVD.They burn data,Not show data.just check your DVD Writer on service center,or try on another DVD Writer. </s>
<s> I AM HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM FOR FIVE YEARS. </s>
<s> SOME OF THE DVDS THAT I CAN SEE THE FILES MAINLY PIX AND VIDEO CLIPS READ CDFS UNDER PROPERTIES AND OTHERS SAY UDF. </s>
<s> I USED ROXIO EASY CREATOR AND ROXIO INSTALED LIMITED VERSION AND NERO AND EVEN A FEW FREE DOWNLOADED DVD BURNERS. </s>
<s> THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE BURNERS AS THEY TEND TO PURPUSELY WANT TO MAKE YOU BUY THEIR REPAIR PRODUCTS. </s>
<s> Folk can use or not use such things. </s>
