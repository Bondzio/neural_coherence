thank you for the reply, so from what i gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer i will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds i could be if i had a 2.0 usb correct?
my only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if i was to move it between computers using the hard drive.
from what i have read and gathered it does not but i just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise.
i planned to just copy my music folder onto an external drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large.
thank you once again for your insight.
