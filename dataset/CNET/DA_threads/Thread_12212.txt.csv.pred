1.1.1	System config : Chaintech CT-7NIL1 motherboard , AMD Athlon XP 2200+ 1.8GHz , originally had 128Mb PC2100/266 DDR SDRAM CL2.5 , located in 3rd DDR slot , slots 1 and 2 empty .	St
1.1.2	Purchased Kingston 512Mb ( 2x256 ) PC3200 2.6V pair .	St
1.1.3	P/N KVR400X64C3AK2/512 .	St
1.1.4	Chaintech manual indicates the board will support speeds from PC2100 up to PC3200 DDR SDRAM , up to 3Gb , 1Gb per slot .	St
1.1.5	Goal was to remove the PC2100 128Mb stick , and use this new pair .	St
1.1.6	Manual also indicates that modules can be located in any of the three available slots , OK to mix densities and speeds within stated limits .	St
1.1.7	Problem is - could not get the PC to boot up using the 2x256Mb pair alone .	St
1.1.8	I have tried every combination possible with the three modules ( using only new module pair , using only one new 256Mb module , using all three modules , using original 128Mb and one of the 256Mb modules , switched locations , etc ) and can at best get the system booted recognizing 384Mb RAM : the 128 and one of the 256 's .	St
1.1.9	Other combinations , PC just wo n't boot ( still OK with original 128Mb alone ) Once I have PC running with the original 128 and one of the 256 's , then I add the 2nd 256 module , and PC wo n't boot .	St
1.1.10	Suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	How is the BIOS set for the memory timing ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is it & quot ; by SPD & quot ; [ uses the data in the PROM on the memory stick to set timings ] .	St
1.2.3	Unfortunately I do not know how the system will handle different settings provided by the 3200 vs the 2100 stick .	St
1.2.4	Remember that the the 128 is slower memory and if it is in the slot whose SPD is read it will set the lower clock speed for all slots .	St
1.2.5	If the 3200 SPD is read then the system would set the memory speed too fast for the 128 MB stick .	St
1.2.6	As I noted this is a wild arsed guess and does n't explain the results of all the options that you tried .	St
1.2.7	Try going into the BIOS and set do n't use & quot ; BY SPD & quot ; and set the timings to the lowest speed possible and try one stck at a time .	St
1.2.8	I have seen on some mobos , that when all slots are full the system drops the memory clock down to the next lower .	St
1.3.1	BIOS options are & quot ; Auto Detect DIMM/PCI Clk & quot ; either enabled or disabled .	St
1.3.2	Original setting was disabled ; I had changed to enabled part way thru all the module swapping ; it remains on & quot ; enabled & quot ; with my current config , 128Mb in slot 1 , slot 2 open , 256 Mb in slot 3 .	St
1.4.1	Another interesting tidbit : With ( 1 ) 128Mb and ( 1 ) 256Mb module , ran www.crucial.com/systemscanner ; it recognizes the 128 correctly as DDR PC2100 , and the 256Mb correctly as DDR PC3200 .	St
1.4.2	I was then able to get the PC to boot up with both 256 's installed , as well as the 128 , although it still only recognized 384Mb total ( did n't see the second 256 , but was able to boot - this has n't always been the case , go figure ) .	St
1.4.3	Then , ran systemscanner again , now it reports both the 128 and the 256 as DDR PC3200 ( did n't detect the other 256 module either ) .	St
1.4.4	This was all done with the BIOS setting & quot ; Auto Detect DIMM/PCI Clk & quot ; enabled .	St
1.5.1	One stick at a time in the same slot ... Something like Memtest86+ , DocMem or even Microfsofts RAM Diag BTW ... what the RAM voltage set to ?	Ques
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	One stick at a time in the same slot ... Something like Memtest86+ , DocMem or even Microfsofts RAM Diag BTW ... what the RAM voltage set to ?	Ques
1.6.2	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Check with ChainTech 's support website to see what if any bios updates are avaialble and what they do .	St
1.7.2	Next , are those new ram modules double or single sided populated ?	Ques
1.7.3	Often times mixng high or low density ram causes problems ( single or double-sided ) .	St
1.7.4	regardless , of what they stated , it does make a difference when you mix it up too much or its just not compatible enough .	St
1.7.5	Play with the ram setting in bios for the default or *safe* level for now .	St
1.7.6	In some cases , you can tweek it abit to the next level of CAS and see if that works better , plus if voltage tweekable , up it a notch .	St
1.7.7	Last , Chaintech , IMHO is not a good mtrbd .	St
1.7.8	though it seems to give you past good service , its a cheapie .	St
1.7.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
