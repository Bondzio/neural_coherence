The Radeon card lasted about a year.
I'm not sure how long the rest of the computer will hold together (it's about three years old, and exhibits some odd idiosyncrasies occasionally) though.
I seem to have bad luck with electronic devices; they always seem to fail too soon.
My last desktop computer failed two years after getting it...
