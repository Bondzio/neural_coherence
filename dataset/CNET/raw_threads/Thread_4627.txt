I cannot select it as a destination using the MS Backup program. I have used it 2 times before and it seemed ok. The drive is shown as ok in WD Diagnostic and also in my device manager. I just cannot browse it or access it for backup. I will appreciate any help as soon as possible. The drive is connected to my Sony Vaio laptop running OS-Windows XP professional version. Other drives have letters C, D as hard drive and F as the CD drive. The external drive is assigned G when it worked.

Are you now using it on the same computer ? * Is it one of those USB external boxes ? * Try it on another computer running XP Pro SP 2. Does it work ? * Do you have any other USB devices ? If so remove one or more of them and try again, or use a different USB port, or * Use a USN Hub to connect your external HD with the other device(s). * Go to Control Panel&gt;Computer Management&gt;Hard Disk Management - is it listed there ? * At the task bar, does the USB icon(safe to remove device) shows, or have you reveive a mesage (device not reconized,etc.) ? Report back.
