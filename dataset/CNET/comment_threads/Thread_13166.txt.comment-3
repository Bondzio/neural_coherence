InterVideo DVD is the problem.
It stops the TV decoder from working.
Remove it from Add/Remove Software.
Than download an update InterVideo DVD software from HP and install it.
As soon as I did this the TV worked again.
The answer came from an online HP tech.
I didn't see what one had to do with the other, but that conflict was the problem.
