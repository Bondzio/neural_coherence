I thought however since you noted 64 bit I'd add this caveat. The 64 bit feature is not in the Core Duo units (I won't double check which might have had it) but was solidly in the Core 2 Duo lineup. Just check the feature list for EM64T in the CPU you are looking at. Bob

The operating system will probably see it as two different processors when scheduling its tasks. However, physically it's not two different processors since it goes in the same socket. Also, I'm quite sure the cores share the same cache, and this is different if you have multiple physical CPUs. Hope this was helpful

And the old memory just &quot;functioned&quot; on the up wave at say 100mhz. So they found out they could double it by making the down wave a function too. And thats why my layman's guess is. That CPU technology just followed suit with the new memory technology. And thats why the slower processor speeds (yet supposedly faster output). The processor's working twice as hard appearing as 2 processors but is really one working on the up and down signals.

A CPU gets bit strings a certain length (32 bit or 64 bit) which are divided up by the operating system. Without the piping in this way, the data would just be garble. Because each string needs a header, a body, and a footer to work (just like networking signals). So if you have a 64 bit processor you're going to need a 64 bit operating system to make the 64 bit long strings with a header, a body, and footer. Or does the &quot;Core 2&quot; make more vague the definition of what a 64 bit processor is (2 32 bit strings in parallel instead of one long 64 bit one)? It seems to me that if you were going to make a multiple processored system, you'd separate the processors instead of piling them up on one another. For cooling purposes and simplicity. I don't know. I'm just babbling.

And figured a processor the size of about 2 inches. And what gigahertz it'd take to breach that 186,000 mile per second barrier. And, don't ask me how because I'm sober now, but somehow I figured out the max processor speed to be somewhere around 3.7 gigahertz. And you have to wonder: When do strange things happen in these processors? Like power spikes and CPU farts. And if thats not why the newer processors are slower.

The proper value to monitor is the number of operations per second known as &quot;flops.&quot; Supercomputers work on the scale of teraflops now-- petaflops will be running all around the world in ~5 years. Still-- to correct your discussion, you're off by a few orders of magnitude. The average distance the electrical signal needs to travel between junctions in the CPU is less than 500 microns (0.05 cm)-- call this D. Speed of light is C~ 3E10 cm/s. Frequency can be approximated by C/D, which comes to half a teraHertz-- that is, ~500 GHz. This is only limited by the circuitry sizes... in fact, there are prototype TeraHertz CPUs developed by places like Los Alamos National Labs. As CPU developers begin to break the micron barrier with nanometer-scales for circuitry, we'll be able to up this petaHertz circuitry (i.e., 1,000,000 GHz)! So, you're back of the envelope was probably a little clouded by that beer yeast-- hopefully it was good beer.

There are now processors with 4 processors in the same socket, but they are really 2 of the dual core processors on the same die. Not for sure if they share the cache or not, haven't looked that close at them because of the price
