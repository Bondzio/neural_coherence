1.3.1	You say you have a Nero OEM .	St

1.3.3	I would still go to Nero and get latest updates .	St

1.4.1	Thank 's chaps , that solves my problem .	St
1.4.2	I will also try for an update .	St
1.4.3	NERO would not let me update from version 5 to 6 and I would think that it will not let me update an OEM version but it is worth a try .	Sug
