I have some computer knowledge, but have never built my own comp before, so i want to get things right . I went on to NewEgg and looked up some stuff, was wondering if this computer would work. I'm going to college next year, so mostly it will be doing word processing, internet, and some light gaming.

AMD 64 3500+ socket 939 venice. and 6600gt pci-express card. dont forget windows nor arctic silver 5 if needeed. caboes come with motherboard so if the drives are oem its okay. you might want to get a higher psu.

Oh yea! PLZ CHECK ALL CABLES ESPECIALLY FANS BEFORE EVEN PLUGGING ANY TYPE OF POWER IN! CHECK THE FANS! CHECK! TRIPLE CHECK. Oh yea: good luck! -Ibrahim

Wattage isn't the only factor when purchasing a psu. the two i said are pretty good. I would've gone for 3000+, because the 3500+ only has a higher clock speed, that's the only difference. You can save quite a bit, and if you really want 3500+, i suggest getting a 3700+ San Diego instead because the 1MB l2 cache is very useful. Don't get ATI due to no SM 3.0Support, you don't want to be playing games in Direct X 8.0 in the future. Go for either a 6600gt, or 6800 instead. Don't forget arctic silver 5, it's way better than the stock, and $8 a tube seems like a good investment into a $300ish processor. Do you have windows?
