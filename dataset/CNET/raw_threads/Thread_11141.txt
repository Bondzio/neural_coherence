After installing a NETGEAR router WNDR3300 (junk) i began getting a new pop up when trying to connect wireless. Using Intel Pro Wireless i choose my network like always and hit connect. i am now being asked for a Device Owner Password. Says it should be written on the router somewhere. nothing would work, found a 8 digit number inside the router that allowed me to get to the next step, which failed anyways. i read horrible reviews about this router so yesterday i installed a TRENDnet TEW-633GR. i have uninstalled all Netgear products on the laptop. uninstalled and reinstalled Intel Pro Wireless from Dell's site and i am still being asked for this Device Owner Password. anyone know what im talking about?

I thought maybe there was so i did look. have always used Linksys and never been asked for something like this.

Read http://download.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/prodbrf/Intel_Next-Gen_Wireless_N_Reviewers_Guide.PDF Find section 4.2.1. Sentance or paragraph number 5 tells us where to turn this on. I bet you could turn it off there. To see a graphic of this, see Figure 13. Bob

These are NEW features and we all get caught having to learn the new ways or learning how to turn them off and on. &quot;Sliced bread is over rated.&quot; Bob
