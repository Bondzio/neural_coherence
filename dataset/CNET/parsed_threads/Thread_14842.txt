<s> We recently had to replace the hard drive in one of our Windows XP PCs. </s>
<s> I thought I had everything up and running OK, but have since discovered that when we attempt to read a diskette, a message displays asking us to insert a disk in Drive A:, even though there is already one there. </s>
<s> Did I miss something in the setup? </s>
<s> It may be that the drive is not hooked up or is not connected properly. </s>
<s> Recheck the drive and connections. </s>
<s> If it still does not work, try a different drive. </s>
<s> It may seem improbable but it has happened that you missed the DC connector alignment. </s>
<s> I had it happen to me. </s>
<s> I also have had the BIOS report the drive was connected and it was, in fact, not connected. </s>
<s> The BIOS must not actually check that it is there. </s>
<s> It depends on the motherboard. </s>
