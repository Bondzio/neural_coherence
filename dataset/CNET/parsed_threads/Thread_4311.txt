<s> When I try to play music on my laptop, it's very slow to load/ play. </s>
<s> The hd space within my laptop is pretty much full now, so I'm thinking that's my problem. </s>
<s> If I were to get myself an external hd with tons more space, loaded my music & music playback software on *that*- it should all run normally, right? </s>
<s> I just wanna be sure 1st before I plunk down $$$. </s>
<s> It all depends on what is taking the space on the primary hard drive. </s>
<s> If music files are the culprit then that should solve the problem, but when an internal hd gets to that situation we often find that other steps are needed, for example, reducing system files like System Restore backup files, (if Windows), uninstalling un-needed software, etc. </s>
<s> So really it is difficult to say whether what you suggest will work or not. </s>
<s> One thing though, where are your backups? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> I suspect it's the music files only because I did notice a gradual slow down with the more music added. </s>
<s> I've backed up the music on dvds </s>
<s> And good to see. </s>
<s> Slow playback of music tracks doesn't necessarily relate to a full hard drive, so I wonder if there is anything else amiss. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> It could very well be the other things you mentioned. </s>
<s> I'll have a look. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
