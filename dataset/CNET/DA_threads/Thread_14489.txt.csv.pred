1.1.1	Hi , My client requires a robust WiFi connection in their premise for 200 users .	St
1.1.2	The premise consist of 2 floors with 8000sqft each .	St
1.1.3	The nature of the business of my client is e-commerce and the Internet usage would be heavy .	St
1.1.4	I am currently looking at deploying a WLAN controller with up to 8 APs ( 4 per floor ) , a load balancer to bind 2 WAN lines and a Fortigate 600C firewall to manage the traffic .	St
1.1.5	I am looking at using Aruba and Peplink or F5 at the moment .	St
1.1.6	One of the most important requirement from my client -- & gt ; near 100 % network uptime .	St
1.1.7	Would appreciate if anyone out there could provide an insight if I am missing out on anything important or could recommend me a better solution .	Ques
1.2.1	Cisco still offers design and deployment services .	St
1.2.2	But you see a new type of IT staffer that uses what they learned on home WiFi networks which is a discussion on its own .	St
1.2.3	That 100 % uptime is nothing I 'd sign up for .	St
1.2.4	Example ?	Ques
1.2.5	Since WiFi is easily disrupted by a bad device and you have devices such as phones and more , no one would sign up for this if they knew .	St
1.2.6	A wired network is not subject to this since we can manage the port and shut off the offending unit .	St
1.2.7	Also , since there are only 2 non-overlapping 802.11n channels , did you plan to pull back to 802.11g to give your design more channels ?	Ques
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	Cisco has the best networking device but it is not within reach of every organization .	St
1.3.2	I have mentioned upfront to my client that nobody would be able to provide SLA on WiFi connectivity .	St
1.3.3	I am not sure if my idea of using LB and firewall are the best but these are the requirements : - Ability to LB between multiple WAN lines from different ISP for performance and redundancy .	St
1.3.4	- Ability to limit b/w per user to prevent abuse - Ability to block/filter web content/torrent and etc .	St
1.3.5	- Very high network uptime ( 99 % ) My initial recommendation would be : WAN -- & gt ; LB -- & gt ; Firewall -- & gt ; Core switch/WLAN controller -- & gt ; 8 x APs	St
1.4.1	Let us know how it turns out .	St
1.4.2	-- & gt ; Network uptime is one thing .	St
1.4.3	WiFi reliability however is an entirely different problem and as long as it 's non-proprietary ( i.e .	St
1.4.4	common WiFi ) then you ca n't give any assurances .	St
1.4.5	All it takes is a bad or rogue device .	St
1.4.6	Bob PS .	St
1.4.7	You did n't write about the channel problems .	St
1.4.8	Here 's a link showing we only get 2 non-overlapping 802.11n channels .	St
1.4.9	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels PPS .	St
1.4.10	The wikipedia has changed to show grinding it even more finely but you get 2 for most setups and just ONE CHANNEL on 802.11n with the 40MHz option .	St
1.5.1	That 's 25 users per hot spot .	St
1.5.2	As you know that WiFi is half duplex , shared access and some WAPs do n't work well with high user counts ( high user count by my definition is ) over handful , you need to be very clear that reliability is not going to be given for the wireless connections .	St
1.5.3	Wired is still king for reliability .	St
1.5.4	If you want to open your company to possible lawsuits and a bad future with a client , go ahead and make WiFi reliability claims .	St
1.5.5	The office I work with would never sign up for that area .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	Hi , you do n't mention why the client wants a WiFi solution .	St
1.6.2	I would have thought that an e-commerce business of this size would more likely have fixed workstations of some sort , in which case , a wired solution is a no brainer .	St
1.6.3	It will be faster , more reliable and more secure than a WiFi system .	St
1.6.4	WiFi is best suited to mobile configurations but even then , it is n't completely clear cut .	St
1.6.5	I worked on a project where the Project Director asked for a WiFi solution and at first sight , that seemed appropriate , in that the network was intended to support visits by remote members of the project group .	St
1.6.6	The Director saw the elimination of physical connections to be & quot ; a good thing & quot ; .	St
1.6.7	It turned out , however , that these remote visitors tended to work on their laptops on their train journeys to the centre and would typically arrive with depleted batteries .	St
1.6.8	Yes , I know batteries are better these days but they do still get depleted .	St
1.6.9	So the workstations were equipped with electrical outlets anyway and so providing an RJ45 socket as well was trivial .	St
1.6.10	But there may be some other reason why your client wants/needs WiFi .	St
1.6.11	I know it 's more expensive but I 'd tend to go for a Cisco solution for a true enterprise class solution .	St
1.6.12	And while the 802.11ac standard has n't yet been finalized , I 've seen & quot ; Pre-ac & quot ; equipment being marketed in the same way that & quot ; Pre-n & quot ; equipment was released in the lead up to confirmation of the final standard .	St
1.6.13	Usually , only a firmware upgrade at worst was needed to comply with the final version of the & quot ; n & quot ; standard .	St
1.6.14	You might want to look into that in that ac is dual band by default in countries where use of the 5 Ghz band is permitted .	St
1.7.1	Hi .	St
1.7.2	1 .	St
1.7.3	Basically the configuration plan that you have come up with seems to be adequate .	St
1.7.4	2 .	St
1.7.5	However , I would suggest a few other things to keep in mind .	St
1.7.6	a .	St
1.7.7	Assume that an access point will be able to handle approximately 14 clients .	St
1.7.8	For your perspective - a normal standard 100/1000 Mbps switch usually has a maximum of 24 ports .	St
1.7.9	And it has a much higher back-plane capacity .	St
1.7.10	( Please do n't start the debate on daisy chaining and/or modular switches ) b .	St
1.7.11	If possible , go for WLC & AP combination that supports 802.11ac - it will make a significant difference on a long run .	St
1.7.12	Maybe not right away but a few months down the line - yes .	Res
1.7.13	If you face bandwidth problems , the only upgrade required would be 802.11ac wireless adapters on the clients .	St
1.7.14	c. Locally , the WLC should be able to distribute the load among the APs .	St
1.7.15	I also presume that the network will be used to transfer files as well or maybe other data + voice facilities may be incorporated in future .	St
1.7.16	d. Use a managed switch and a router in between to break the network into smaller units using VLANs , of perhaps 30 clients each .	St
1.7.17	You can purchase either a second hand 'Cisco switch & router ' or a 'layer 3 switch ' off ebay that is compatible with your 'wireless networks ' bandwidth .	St
1.7.18	Breaking up the network will prevent the individual network segments from saturating adjacent networks and will result in more efficient load distribution .	St
1.7.19	e. For load balancing at the WAN edge , I personally prefer SuSE linux enterprise server configured with Squid proxy server .	St
1.7.20	If that is too much for you , then a pre-configured linux distribution by the name of ClearOS is available .	St
1.7.21	Its free version will allow you to load balance incoming WAN connections , provided that they terminate as Ethernet ends and it also lets you restrict bandwidth with the flexibility of choosing network segments and/or individual ip address ' .	St
1.7.22	Of course it is just an individual preference to use hardware load balancer vs PC configured as one .	St
1.7.23	f. 100 % network up-time .	St
1.7.24	Very 'bite-you-in-the-behind-when-you-are-not-looking ' kind of assurance to provide .	St
1.7.25	But that is true for all network related projects .	St
1.7.26	Take care .	St
