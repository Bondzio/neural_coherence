1.3.1	As moderator Bob Proffitt says : hard disks are temporary storage .	St
1.3.2	I get the impression you thought it was permanent storage .	St
1.3.3	It is n't .	St
1.3.4	That 's why we make a backup copy for the & quot ; important data & quot ; ( and , in fact , that 's most data ) .	St
1.3.5	Kees	St

1.5.1	It sounds like you have corrupted your volumes .	St
1.5.2	It could be due to a failure of the operating system , a virus or an errant program .	St
1.5.3	There is an outside chance that it is the result of sector drop out .	St
1.5.4	Sector drop out occurs when the drive has bad sectors replaced by spares from the bad sector list function .	St
