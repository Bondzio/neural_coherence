I have tried to find info, but all I come up with are steps to set up file sharing on earlier versions of OSX - these steps have apparently changed with 10.4.2. FYI: I have no problems (other than constant fluctuations in signal strength) sharing my internet connection between computers. Also, what is the trick to being able to use the HP print driver (supplied with printer) on my HP 764c? I can print over the network, but only using the generic print driver in Bonjour. By doing this I can't access any of the special print features on my printer. My network: Cable modem and HP Officejet 7310xi connected to an Airport Express base station. iMac G5 (OSX 10.4.2) with an Airport Extreme card. HP 764c (Windows XP Home SP2) with a Netgear WG311T wireless adapter. Airport Express base station (configured as WDP) connected to home stereo (for iTunes streaming.
