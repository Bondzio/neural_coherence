When we rebooted the computer in the morning - we get little or no power. The computer seems to start up ok, the light turns green, then you can hear the power quieten down & the light fades to a pale yellow. Nothing works from that point on. Is this the power supply that has burned out or does someone know what else it could be?

And at 500mA at 5V that's 2.5 Watts. This should not strain any machine's 300 and up Watt power supply. I'd look eleswhere for the cause such as age, etc. Bob
