1.1.1	I just got a 500 GB WD my passport essential.	St
1.1.2	I plugged it in and found that it wasn't what I expected.	St
1.1.3	It turned out to be a back-up and not a hard drive.	St
1.1.4	Is there a way to make it act like a regular internal hard drive, you know, drag and drop or just put music or files on it?	St
1.1.5	I guess this isn't very clear, but I would like help anyways.	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	the back up is the software that allows u to back up your computer, u can either opt for it or just ignore and carry on using it as a hard disk.	St
1.2.2	try formating the hard disk before use if you don't want the back up software.	St
