&quot;Only choose the 4 pin unit if you have the 4 pin plug connected to something in your PC, otherwise you do not need it.&quot; There may be extra connections that are never used.
You didn't reveal if the 3 pin is used on the old setup.
Sadly, I haven't found the service manual for that model, but did find the note and clue above.
