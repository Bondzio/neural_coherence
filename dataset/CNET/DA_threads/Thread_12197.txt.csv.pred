1.1.1	hi there, I am thinking of buying an old PII 133 laptop, (I will probably install win98 on it) but it doesn't have USB port so I am wondering, to xfer various files larger than 1.4 mb, can I hook this thing up to my win 2000 machine via a parallel cable?	St
1.1.2	and if so, what do i need beyond the cable itself?	St
1.1.3	will windows just start talking back and forth or do I need some software?	Sug
1.1.4	speed is not a big issue here --fj PS it has a &quot;IrDA 1.0&quot; port, whatever THAT is - fj	St
1.2.1	Documented at http://www.techno-link.com/wown/dccmain.htm Bob	St
1.3.1	The best s/w to do this is called, &quot;Laplink&quot; which also includes the cable.	St
1.3.2	Older Laplink s/w ver.	St
1.3.3	will do fine, it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s/w now and but check to be sure it will handle your OS.	St
1.3.4	Win98 and above offer MS own &quot;DCC&quot; s/w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that's OK for most users.	St
1.3.5	That's installed from the OS install CD from the add/remove s/w icon.	St
1.3.6	You still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required.	St
1.3.7	The IrDA is &quot;infared connection&quot; ability.	St
1.3.8	That's also possible if goping that route, but it can be complex at times.	St
1.3.9	good luck -----Willy	Polite
