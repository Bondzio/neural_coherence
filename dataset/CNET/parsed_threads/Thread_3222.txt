<s> Hey, I have missplaced my quick restore CD for my Compaq Presario 7598. </s>
<s> I spoke with technical support and they no longer supply the CD. </s>
<s> Does any have this CD and want to get rid of it or does anyone know a awy around my problem. </s>
<s> I installed XP and uninstalled it and now I am having problems with some Windows 98 drivers. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> the drivers for anything that came with it from the Compaq website which I think is now HP since they merged. </s>
<s> Search for the Model # in google and you should get to the correct site. </s>
<s> If you reformat the drive using the regular format you will also lose access to the bIOS. </s>
<s> You should also be able to download files to a floppy that will allow you to access the BIOS / SETUP files again. </s>
<s> 1. installing XP may have deleted the 4mb F10 diagnostic/boot menu nonDOS partition. </s>
<s> Do you still have the F10 &quot;setup&quot; option? </s>
<s> at boot? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If not, you must start over again with no partitions on your Hdd AFTER downloading the floppy maker from HP-Compaq and have 3 no-error floppies. </s>
<s> You go through a process of inserting the different floppies back and forth OR use the floppies by themselves at boot that will present BIOS/setup to you. </s>
<s> 3. then make a primary DOS fat32 partition and load win98. </s>
<s> You'll have to have the downloaded drivers on a CD or slave Hdd. </s>
<s> 4. http://h18000.www1.hp.com to start the search for Presario driver section and more. </s>
<s> You only lose the F10 partition if you have deleted all partitions or have a new Hdd. </s>
<s> I have a 7598. </s>
<s> It has two restore disks. </s>
<s> I have never used them but I can try to burn them but I am not sure you can do that. </s>
<s> Gene </s>
<s> where at first you said you didn't have one. </s>
<s> These are CD's, right? </s>
<s> Yes they can be burnt if you make a CD image first, then burn from the image. </s>
<s> Why are you wanting to burn them? </s>
<s> Except they are borrowed? </s>
<s> They should be allready labeled, 1 as system restore, which reformats the Hdd, puts in the F10 partition, and loads the OS. </s>
<s> 2 is the driver and software CD, used next. </s>
<s> What happens when u try them? </s>
<s> I dont know what you are talking about in your message. </s>
<s> &quot;now you have two&quot; what does that mean. </s>
<s> I have the same computer, he needs the restore disks. </s>
<s> I have them and have never used them. </s>
<s> I dont plan on giving them to him. </s>
<s> But I will burn him a copy of each if it can be done, also if he is willing to pay for the cost of shipping. </s>
<s> I have never opened the pack the restore disks came in and I dont know what they say on them. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> I thought that was a gillaks reply. </s>
<s> Nice of you to offer a hard to find item. </s>
<s> Hope he responds. </s>
<s> Hope it is the same model Compaq. </s>
<s> Again, yes you can burn them, suggested to make an image file first. </s>
<s> I can make you a copy of the CD's for $30.00....let me know if you are interested </s>
<s> I can give you the setup files for you maybe through your AIM if you have one for FREE. </s>
<s> I have a friend who has the exact same model as you, so I could get it for you. </s>
<s> E-mail me at HKPK_2005@Yahoo.com if you're interested... </s>
<s> U Have the Compaq Presario CD's? </s>
<s> Needed to restores the system Chipsets?? </s>
<s> Let me know darc_prime@yahoo.com </s>
