1.1.1	I have a problem with my laptop that the screen freezes and i can't close it except by pressing the on/off button for a long time.	St
1.1.2	And sometimes it appears a blue screen with many letters and numbers and at the buttom &quot;Phyisical error&quot; and it restarts by itself then freezes.	St
1.1.3	When i open it again after a while it says &quot;Computer restarted after an unexpected shutdown.	St
1.1.4	WinXP detected a possible device failure.	St
1.1.5	The driver for the display device was unable to complete a drawing operation&quot; and says that ATI Mobility 128 AGP 2X (COMPAC) could be responsible.	St
1.1.6	I don't think it is a software problem cause the screen freezed with me when i was formating the laptop and when i was installing WinXP.	St
1.1.7	By the way, i bought the laptop years before and it is Compac Presario.	St
1.1.8	What shall i do?	St
1.1.9	SORRY for the long post.	St
1.1.10	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	Have you updated the video driver from the Compaq website?	St
1.2.2	It could be there is a new driver that takes care of this problem.	St
1.3.1	Sorry i am a begginer and i have a question.	St
1.3.2	When the screen feezed while my operating system was uninstalled (by formating) is an update issue??	St
1.3.3	?	Ques
1.4.1	I agree, this does not sound like a software problem.	St
1.4.2	I'm hoping your laptop has a floppy drive, if so try this diagnostic software.	St
1.4.3	http://www.tufftest.com/tt01-lite.htm the lite version is available free and should give you an idea of any hardware problems.	St
1.4.4	Then you will know what you are facing.	St
1.4.5	If is a hardware problem; because you are a beginner and working on laptops is rather tricky, I think you have 2 choices based on the age/value of the laptop.	St
1.4.6	1. take it to a professional repair facility.	St
1.4.7	2. start shopping for a new laptop -- good news is that prices are lower than ever... My repair experience is with Dell laptops and it sounds like either a connection issue or a cracked/ heat-damaged motherboard or video card.	St
1.4.8	Depending on the model of your laptop, these can be really labor intensive to get to.	St
1.4.9	Remember even damaged laptops have value to someone, I've sold non-working laptops for parts on eBay.	St
1.4.10	So it's not a total loss if it can't be revived.	St
1.4.11	I'm sorry I can't give better advice, hopefully this helps to some small degree.	Polite
1.5.1	NIL	St
