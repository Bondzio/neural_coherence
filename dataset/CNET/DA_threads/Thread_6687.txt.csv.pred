1.1.1	I plan to purchase a G4 Powerbook , but I ca n't decide if I should get the 12-inch or 15-inch model .	St
1.1.2	Please respond to this post with any relevant guidance on the purchase decision .	Sug
1.1.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.4	Best , Joel	St
1.2.1	If you are doing more graphics intensive apps , or using photoshop , go with the 15 inch .	St
1.2.2	However , if you need a computer for travel or for mostly business applications , go with the 12 .	St
1.3.1	the 12 is a nice friendly size for coach class .	St
1.3.2	The 15 is just a little big for coach , but all of the people around you will be impressed by the screen size and brightness , and you will get away with it .	St
1.3.3	A 17 in coach will get you a 2 drink penalty for encroachment .	St
1.3.4	you will have to buy a drink for the person on each side of you to make up for not being able to maintain your lane .	St
1.3.5	The worst part of this is that you then have to worry about their drinks spilling on your lap top .	St
1.3.6	You also have to bring extra earphones and an audio spliter .	St
1.3.7	Porn movies are a risky choice .	St
1.3.8	I have a 15 , because I need the screen space for tool bars and tool tabs , and option windows .	St
1.3.9	My buddy used to have a 15 , but now has a 12 and likes it better because of coach , because of weight , and because of computer bag options .	St
1.3.10	If it sits on a desk for 90 % of it 's life , get a big screen .	St
