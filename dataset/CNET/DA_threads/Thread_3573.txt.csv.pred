1.1.1	I 'm in the market for a high end gaming desktop and was looking around at the Alienware machines and Dell 's machines which would run over $ 4500 for everything I wanted .	St
1.1.2	I figure I can probably build for cheaper and was looking for suggestions for a $ 4000 budget .	St
1.1.3	This would be my first time building , so I 'd also like to hear if it 's worth it for me to be building such a high end system as a newb .	St
1.1.4	Thanks , Gautrau	St
1.2.1	Here 's my suggestion .	St
1.2.2	It 's a bit over-budget ( $ 4235 ) but these prices are ball-park ... agressive price-shopping could shave a couple-hundred off .	St

1.4.19	I never use a sound card .	St
1.4.20	and i boought a pair of 35.00 apple speakers that sound great .	St
1.4.21	a sound card is useless .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	i do n't know about you , but if i 'm spending $ 4K on a PC ( regardless of purpose ) , it better not break down on me .	St
1.6.2	the C : drive in my config is mirrored raptors ... if one dies , the PC keeps going .	St
1.6.3	as for the D : drive , its striped for extremely fast transfer to reduce level loading times .	St
1.6.4	and since its for a gamer and games chew up storage ( especially if you make virtual cd/dvd images ) , the d : drive will accomodate a big library of games .	St
1.6.5	water cooling is great if you 're a tinkerer .	St
1.6.6	frankly , i do n't want to risk my $ 4K setup because of a bad seal .	St
1.6.7	eVGA 's a good brand , but XFX 's XXX series is pre-overclocked and guaranteed to run at those speeds .	St
1.6.8	Their 7900GT XXX is almost as fast as a stock 7900GTX .	St
1.6.9	And when you add 2 of them in SLI , they will smoke any single 7900GTX .	St
1.6.10	Some Antec power supplies are known to be incompatible with SLI ( insufficient 12V amperage ) .	St
1.6.11	I like Antec , but I do n't use them for SLI builds ( better safe than sorry ) .	St
1.6.12	the dell 24 & quot ; monitor puts gaming at a new level .	St
1.6.13	blows away a 19 & quot ; with only 1280x1024 res .	St
1.6.14	and with the tv tuner , windows mce , wireless keyboard/mouse and the kick-a $ $ $ speakers , this gamer can also be the centerpiece of an entertainment system .	St
1.7.1	Your right about the ANTEC , Some are not acompatible to SLI and some are .	St
1.7.2	the one i picked is .	St
1.7.3	Also if i speed 4k on a gaming computer .	St
1.7.4	Purpose is important to me .	St
1.7.5	and a failed HD on a Gaming computer is like a busted tail light on a car .	St
1.7.6	Yeah i wish it was not broke but i will fix it .	St
1.7.7	so i have reinstall windows and some games .	St
1.7.8	at least last years taxes did not get losed .	St
1.7.9	I do not find it a tradedy if i lose a game because of a HD crash .	St
1.7.10	I do not know about you , but how many HD 's have just all of sudden dropped of line before they were 4years old .	St
1.7.11	as for XFX and Evga ... that is all about quality not speed or preformance .	St
1.7.12	one thing about computer parts is ... if you buy cheap , you buy twice .	St
1.7.13	you got me on the DELL , I was getting close to 4k spot .	St
1.7.14	and why media center .	St
1.7.15	for a gamer you just need home .	St
1.7.16	that will save him 50.00	St

1.9.1	Thanks for some helpful responses !	St
1.9.2	What do you guys think of this one that I pulled together from Newegg : Thermaltake Armor Series V ATX Full Tower Case - 139.99 ASUS A8N32-SLI Deluxe Socket 939 NVIDIA nForce SPP 100 ATX AMD Motherboard - 204.99 AMD Athlon 64 FX60 Toledo 1GHz HT Socket 939 Dual Core Processor - 1011.99 eVGA 256-P2-N563-AX GeForce 7900GT 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Video Card - 638.00 ( price for x2 ) ePOWER Silent Engine Tiger 650 EP-650P5-T1 ATX 650 Watts Power Supply - 169.99 CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR400 ( PC3200 ) Unbuffered System Memory - 284.00 ( price for 4GB total ) Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.00Gb/s Hard Drive - 285.00 ( do n't think I 'll need this big , but just threw it on the list ) Logitech G15 2-Tone USB Wired Standard Keyboard - 69.95 Logitech G5 Laser 6-Buttons Wheel USB Laser Mouse - 46.89 NEC 16X DVD+/-RW DVD Burner - 36.99 Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeMusic 7.1 Channels PCI Interface Sound Card - 121.99 Logitech Z-5500 505 Watts 5.1 Speaker - 213.98 Samsung 940b 19 & quot ; 8ms LCD Monitor - 329.99 Does not include operating system , but the total so far is $ 3553.75 .	St
1.9.3	Let me know what you think .	St
1.9.4	Gautrau	St
1.10.1	... get the X2 4800+ and save $ 400 while minimally sacraficing performance .	St
1.10.2	I personally would n't get anything over the X2 3800+ .	St
1.10.3	Get 2 gigs of RAM because 4 is the limit for a 32-bit OS , and XP 64-bit edition is rather buggy .	St
1.10.4	When Vista comes out , gamers will need 4 gigs of RAM , so get two 1GB sticks and upgrade when it 's needed .	St
1.10.5	Because price is no object , get XMS RAM rahter than ValueSelect .	St
1.10.6	I 've never heard of ePOWER before , so I 'd get an Enermax : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817194004 If the power supply goes , the system goes , so you do n't want to skimp on that to save money .	St
1.10.7	Also , save money by getting a 300GB hard drive .	St
1.10.8	Just my thoughts	Polite
1.11.1	With a good coolor ( like arctic cooling 's freezer 64 pro ) you should easily be able to OC it to 2.5/2.6 ghz and it will be just a smidge slower than a fx60 .	St
1.11.2	( check out the forums at overclockers.net , xbitlabs , anandtech , etc .	St
1.11.3	to get OC tips for this mobo/cpu . )	St
1.11.4	Do n't cheap out and get VS RAM .	St
1.11.5	Cut back to 2GB and get DDR-500 RAM ( g.skill extreme is on sale now at $ 157 for 2gb ) .	St
1.11.6	2GB is more than enough for any of today 's games , and you can always add more in the future when the price goes down .	St
1.11.7	With these suggestions , you 've saved $ 600 so why not move up to a widescreen monitor .	St
1.11.8	20 & quot ; WS 's are about $ 100 more than the 19 & quot ; Samsung .	St
