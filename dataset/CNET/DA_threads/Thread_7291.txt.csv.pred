1.3.1	I have bought a few refurbished computer desktops at tiger , and they were gateways that have worked great , and I am still using them .	St

1.3.5	When you click on desktop computers look to the left side menu , and click on refurbished .	St
1.3.6	They always are getting new stock in , so check on it every so often .	St

1.5.1	If you are only going to use it for email and internet and a few basic programs ( no games or HD movies etc ) .	St
1.5.2	try a compact desktop or net top .	Sug
1.5.3	They sell for around 200-350 here in the uk which is about $ 300- $ 500 .	Sug
1.5.4	However , if you want to spend slightly more and have a pretty good spec PC .	St
1.5.5	I have just custom built a PC with an AMD athlon 2 quad core 2.6GHz and 4GB 800mhz ram for about 400 ( ~ $ 600 ) minus hard drives and CD/DVD drives which I took from the old PC , because there is nothing wrong with them , and im guessing you could do the same ( although you have to be careful because if they are IDE , most modern motherboards only have one IDE connector so you either have to buy an expensive sata-IDE connector or try and find a motherboard with 2 IDE connectors ( unless you only have 2 drives , 1 IDE cable has 2 other sockets on it ) , but I suspect you could buy a small hard drive and CD/DVD read/writer for about $ 100 .	St
1.5.6	If you find an external drive thats cheaper than an internal drive , you can usually open them up and find a standard 3.5 & quot ; hard drive or 5.25 & quot ; disk drive .	St
1.5.7	I bought an external memorex CD/DVD burner and opened it up and found a standard 5.25 & quot ; drive with standard connectors .	St
1.6.1	This should do the trick : http : //www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml ? product_id=0321350 Microsoft Windows 7 Professional ( 64-bit ) *** Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q8300 4GB DDR2 RAM 500GB 7,200RPM Hard Drive SuperMulti 8x Double Layer DVDRW Drive 8-in-1 Media Card Reader Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3100 10/100 Network	St
1.7.1	My generic advice is to buy name-brand .	Ques
1.7.2	I think $ 700 is more than enough for what you want , though streaming video to your TV might cost you extra .	St
