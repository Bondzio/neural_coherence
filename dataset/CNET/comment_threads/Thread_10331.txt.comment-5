My newest upgrade - a dell 24in monitor.
powered by an asus x1900xtx video care (512mb) I have an asus p5w dh mobo w/2g ram and a digiwave cable tv card.
tv never looked this good on my tube 32in.
same with dvd's.
if you can afford the 32 lcd - go for it.
you will need a good video card that has HDMI output to get best pic.
