Hi there.
Thanks for taking the time to answer but in this situation make/model or even OS are irrelevant.
Even the motherboard type is irrelevant.
I have seen this on many types of machines.
I had googled several things prior to posting this message.
I found that most folks had errors or problems when getting this kind of behavior.
In my case there are no errors or problems other than my lack of patience while waiting for my machine to start up.
But thank you anyway.
