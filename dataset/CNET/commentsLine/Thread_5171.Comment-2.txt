1. take out a stick of memory.
with windows 98, you may not notice it from 384 to 256 megabytes of memory.
2. leave to case cover off.
3. age.
sadly, even with no visible signs of capacitor issues, they still age.
the power supply, motherboard and cpu are prime hardware suspects if a total reload of the os doesn't cure it.
4. no parasites allowed.
this is my non-negotiable item with five noted scans/tools at  there are more than virus out there.
you don't want these either and norton does nothing to stop these.
5. unless i could get those parts for under 20 bucks, i would not repair this machine.
