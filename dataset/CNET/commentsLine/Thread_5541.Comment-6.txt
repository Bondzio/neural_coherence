does the seagate utility that you mention enable you to add a second hdd as only an capacity increase on the drive i currently use?
iow, can this app help users (in a simplified manner) put 2 or more drives together to possibly just build a large drive?
for example, i'm considering turning my 40gb and 20gb drives into a 60.
