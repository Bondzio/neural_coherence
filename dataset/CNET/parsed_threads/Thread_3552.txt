<s> I have determined that I need a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I have an AMD Athlon XP 3200+ processor. </s>
<s> I would like: At least 2 rear USB 2.0 ports Ethernet Sound Rear FireWire port At least 3, up to 5, PMCIA slots SATA and PATA connectors Attachments for front USB ports At least attachments for 4 HD/CD drives, hopefully 6 to 8. </s>
<s> 4 DDR RAM slots Any ideas on a mobo that fits this? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> only 2 or 3 Socket A boards will feature that, and I wouldn't suggest any of them My personal suggestion: Abit AN7 Secondary suggestion: Abit NF-7 S barring those, DFI's LanParty NFII Ultra B is good (expensive if it's still avliable) and Gigabyte's GA7N400-L wasn't a bad board for the short time I used it... </s>
<s> Those are easily to find in any good computer shop, my mainboard was pretty cheap and it has 3 memory modules, 6 hd places (4 serial), and 10 usb ports so you really don't have to look for the most expensive. </s>
<s> I'm just suggesting a good model, that should serve him just fine, and in my experience it's better safe than sorry, purchase from a known good maker than from a no-name store and end up getting over charged on it... </s>
<s> get a server 8 or 16 sticks 2 agp the future needsmorememory </s>
<s> I looked on Newegg and couldn't find any Socket A server motherboards. </s>
<s> Could you suggest one? </s>
<s> i wouldn't get a server mobo, that's just way to expensive and it's something you don't need at all </s>
