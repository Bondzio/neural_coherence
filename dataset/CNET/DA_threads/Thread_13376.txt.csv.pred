1.1.1	My brand new Asus G75 laptop wo n't recognize my Western Digital 1TB external hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It works in my friend 's almost identical laptop , and my laptop is correctly recognizing other usb inputs .	St
1.1.3	The hard drive spins when plugged in , but the led on the exterior of the drive does n't come on .	St
1.1.4	I 'm pretty sure it is n't showing up in device manager or disk management .	St
1.1.5	I 've also tried all the ports .	St
1.1.6	I think I read somewhere that some driver updates can screw up the usb 's , but the problem only comes up with this hard drive .	St
1.1.7	Here are where I 've looked for it : http : //imgur.com/PR6oU http : //imgur.com/TQN6a http : //imgur.com/t6rfk	Ques
1.2.1	Things to try : 1 .	Sug
1.2.2	Use the laptop with the power adapter .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Use an Y-USb-cable ( two connectors , one extra for power ) 3 .	St
1.2.5	Use a powered hub in between .	St
1.2.6	The combination of # 2 and # 3 should work , but maybe one of them is enough already .	St

1.3.1	You should n't need any drivers for your setup to work .	St
1.3.2	It should be recognized from the USB port once connected as the OS supplies the necessary acknowledgement .	St
1.3.3	Adding to what Kees has already stated , be 100 % sure the USB ports of your laptop are actually enabled .	St
1.3.4	If you installed any s/w to correct , remove or uninstall its not needed .	St
1.3.5	Since , you did n't mention what OS was being used , I assume its Win7 .	St
1.3.6	Also , I assume the laptop itself was properly all updated for use to its latest , to include the OS and mtrbd .	St
1.3.7	drivers and possibility bios as well .	St
1.3.8	As for s/w installed , I exclude what maybe WD bundle supplied for better use of the ext .	St
1.3.9	HD , NOT as a driver .	St
