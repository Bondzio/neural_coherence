Use an AC desk personal 6in.
fan or a &quot;clamp-on&quot; fan to direct airflow into the open system case.
I've done this for yrs.
when the old home is too hot and want to cool the system.
I can probably use typical 120mm fans with a mtrbd./psu connection but the household fan does just fine and lessen the psu for that.
When it gets real hot inside the house a 10in.
fan is a back-up.
Yeah, I don't live in a A/C cooled home, but for the bedroom.
