<s> Bought (and returned) a Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive, 500GB, yesterday and tried to use it on a public Mac but couldn't because I didn't have the &quot;admin&quot; password to install the required compatibility software (and can't get one). </s>
<s> I need to buy an ext. </s>
<s> storage device that can work with my WinXP PC and be written to on this public Mac running OS X. </s>
<s> Please suggest a Brand and Model that will work for this, I am at a loss. </s>
<s> It seems the goflex can be formatted for the apple and be used without said app. </s>
<s> Why not do that? </s>
<s> As to the PC and MAC issue, deeply discussed so while NTFS will give ME THE BEST results I wonder if a public mac is up to date to use that. </s>
<s> FAT32 is an option but is not reliable for me. </s>

<s> Thanks for the input, I'm still at a loss because I'd have to figure out this formatting issue on my PC, and I'm not sure that's possible from the research I've done. </s>
<s> In response, the Mac is very new, it's some sort of a pro computer that I'm using FinalCutPro on, so not only do I need my hard drive for memory but also to use as scratch disk space. </s>
<s> I'm not tech savvy at all, and I can't really try it out again because Office Depot told me that they made an exception, but there are no refunds on this item (just even exchanges). </s>
<s> So, unless I buy something online someplace else and wait and pay for shipping, then O.D. </s>
<s> is my only local option. </s>
<s> Any additional input would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I wish I were better at this stuff... Marcy </s>
<s> And you could get the same effect by placing your router in the location you would put this repeater. </s>
<s> This repeater according to its document did not need an ethernet cable. </s>
