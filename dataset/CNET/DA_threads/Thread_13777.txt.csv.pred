1.1.1	Hey everyone!	St
1.1.2	I'm getting myself a new gaming computer from buyxg.com.	St
1.1.3	I would like to get two Nvidia GeForce 8800 (640 mb) for my computer.	St
1.1.4	The other stats are 4GB of Corsair (Heat Spreader) RAM, and 6000+ AMD Dual Core processor.	St
1.1.5	My motherboard specs are (MSI K9N4 SLI-F nForce 500 SLI Chipset DDR2/800 SATA-II RAID MBoard w/ Dual 16x PCI-Express), to be exact.	St
1.1.6	What I want to do is put it all into a medium sized case (NZXT Nemesis Elite).	St
1.1.7	What I DON'T know is what I should put my power supply at for best performance (I'm not exactly sure about the power supplies).	St
1.1.8	So basically what I'd like to know is the power supply that I should use to support all of this and if my medium sized case could fit all of this.	St
1.1.9	I'd REALLY appreciate any help you could give to me since I don't know TOO much about these things, and I really don't want to order a computer that isn't going to work (or lags really bad.)	St
1.1.10	Thanks to you all in advance!	St
1.2.1	I have heard that the 8800 series cards, though amazingly fast and powerful, take up substantially more space in your case (rhyme unintentional).	St
1.2.2	I wish I had your budget for a PC!	St
1.2.3	As for the power supplies I have heard of people using anything as low as 650w and as high as 1100.. :-/ sorry not too much help on that.	St
1.3.1	Get to know how much power your parts eat up, or at the most estimate!	Ques
1.3.2	since putting together a computer is usually done once take time to figure these things out and youll be a happy gamer.	St
1.3.3	as for getting to new vid cards i tell me how it looks and works because i im getting a 8800 soon and was thinking of 2 cards as well lol.	St
1.4.1	Yeah, I have been taking time to figure most of things out, but for some reason, the power supply and the power requirements have been the hardest things to figure out.	St
1.4.2	I'm not sure why... actually, its just that I cant find any sites that accurately say how much power the parts take up, and I can't find any sites that say anything more than the minimum power for 1 8800.	Res
1.4.3	On NVidia.com actually, it says that the minimum power for 1 GeForce 8800 is a 400 watt power supply... but does that mean that two 8800s would need a 800 watt power supply?	St
1.4.4	Because on different forums, people seem to hint at the fact that they have two 8800s but don't even have an 800 watt power supply...	St
1.4.5	If possible, could any of you link me to a helpful site?	St
1.4.6	Thanks for your help so far.	Polite
1.5.1	seeing browsing the web myself looking for upgrades(don't quote me, only going by memory): case: get full tower, you'll need it for cooling power supply: anywear from 750-1000 cpu: I've been looking at them myself (I have a 64x2 4400).	St
1.5.2	The 6000 can use up to 140w itself.	St
1.5.3	with the 2gpu's and 6000 the psu should probably be closer to 1000 to be on the safe side.	St
1.6.1	http://www.extreme.outervision.com/index.jsp	St
1.7.1	Go to www.slizone.com and click on &quot;Power Supplies.&quot; You can then select &quot;SLI Certified&quot; power supplies to be sure that you are getting a PSU that will handle your hardware.	St
1.7.2	It looks like they start at 650W and go up from there A good place to start...hope it helps!	St
1.8.1	That was the perfect site for me; now I KNOW what I need to get.	St
1.8.2	Thanks for all of your help, guys!	St
1.9.1	i read tht each nviida card take up about 500watts/ i want to get 2 at some point but it jsut takes up to much power.	St
