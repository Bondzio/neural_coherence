using SATA drives.
I can't say the same for PATA, however.
Of course accidental deletions or copying of corrupt data is a pure loss but I've had &quot;hiccups&quot; on one drive in a set that were recoverable and have lost a drive in a set that allowed the other to run ok until I could replace it's dead mate.
Another time I had a bad power connector that caused one drive to spin down intermittently causing a data mismatch which was recoverable by booting to the hardware rebuild utility.
It took a doggone long time...overnight in fact...for the rebuild...but it did survive.
I'd agree it's not a sole basket to keep your eggs in, however as I have lost other data due to human error.
