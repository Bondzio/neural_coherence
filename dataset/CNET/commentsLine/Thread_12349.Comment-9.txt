i have networked pcs for several years.
first a wired, 4 port router, then a wired/wireless.
4 port router + 802.11b and now wired/wireless 4 port router + 80211.g.
i have always used linksys equipment without any problems; however that is not to say the others do not work as well.
i also, for a time, had an ipaq pda on the network.
although it is possible to get a combination router cable modem, there doesn't appear to be a viable router dsl modem for use on verizons dsl network.
even if their were i probably would not recommend it since my modem had to be replaced when verizon change its network speed from 768kbits to 1.5 mbits, the current verizon speed switch from 1.5 mbits to 3 mbits did not require a new modem.
i have only experienced one significant outage since october 1999 and other than that i never had to restart my modem or router except with i have a power failure and the ups ran dry (about twenty minutes).
modems and routers should be like the energizer bunny they should just keep running and running.
i do not see the need for 108 mbit wireless links, since the normal 54 mbit 802.11g speed is greater that you maximum down load speed it wont improve downloads.
and unless you are transferring a great deal of data between nodes on your network the speed will be wasted.
i would not buy belkins pre n products since the 802.11n standard is not yet fixed in stone.
