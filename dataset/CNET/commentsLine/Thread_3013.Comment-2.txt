the pc will always work at the lowest speed compatible with the memory you have.
so if you have 2100 and 2700, it will work at 2100 speed.
i am not sure what the price difference is between those two.
but i would recommend spending a little more for higher speed, so you can use that for the future as well.
in two years, you probably dump that 2100 bcus it would be so outdated.
you will still be able to keep the 2700 in two years though.
you can check out whosave.com, maybe they list some 2700 on sale.
