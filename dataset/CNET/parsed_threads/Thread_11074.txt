<s> In the near future I plan to build my own PC, the problem I encounter is the graphics card, I want an ATI RADEON HD 4770, I life in Spain and all that I can find is ASUS/XFX/CLUB 3D/POWERCOLER/SAPPHIRE + RADEON HD 4770, and nothing like ATI RADEON HD 4770, is not even listed on AMD spain site, the question is: 1) the only difference between these cards and ATI RADEON HD 4770 is the name? </s>
<s> the perfomance will be the same on all cards? </s>
<s> 2) 128-bit, is it a big problem? </s>
<s> your 1st ques - ATI makes the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) which is then embedded on a graphic card which is manufactured by ASUS/XFX/CLUB 3D/POWERCOLER/SAPPHIRE etc. </s>
<s> your 2nd ques: The 128 Bit bandwidth of Radeon HD 4770 having GDDR5 memory is about thrice faster than graphics card with GDDR3 memory having the same clock freqeuncy. </s>
<s> So its the best card in its price range(sometimes even better than some of the pricier ones like Raadeon HD 4850) So go for Radeon HD 4770 with no hesitation... </s>
<s> well, know that everything is clear all I need to say is thank you. </s>
<s> practically impossible to find. </s>
<s> if you can find one, it's $120(USD) or more. </s>
<s> hd 4850 512mb is still a bit faster and manufacturers have dropped its price $105. </s>
<s> hd 4870 512mb and hd 4850 1gb is down to $125. </s>
<s> so either is a better (and readily available) choice than the hd 4770 now. </s>
<s> Spain sites are all full with radeon hd 4770 so it's very easy to find one and costs around 110Dollar, also the 40nm process technology is more appealing and is GDDR5 against 4850 that's GDDR3.I just like more 4770. </s>
<s> is not that I like more radeon hd 4770, I think that 40nm+GDDR5 makes better, and still I'm not decided what card to buy, every advice counts. </s>
