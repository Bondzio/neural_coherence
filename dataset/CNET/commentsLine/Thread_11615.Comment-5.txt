hey og1337, dude, i've been looking for a review of hp x20led for days now, yours is the only 'kinda' review i found.
i've got a great deal on this but money's kinda tight so i gotta be sure.
can you tell me a bit more about your experience with the x20led, any shortcomings etc.
i'd be really grateful.
