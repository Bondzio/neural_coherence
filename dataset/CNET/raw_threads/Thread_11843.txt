I am getting a new system less a HD and would like to put the current hard drive in it. It will have an Intel P4 3.6ghz with an intel motherboard ASRock 755 Dual-Vista. Can I put it in and power it up and will it run???

The reason why this is so harkens back to a change in Windows released in 1995. With each successive version, there were more changes to assure that we don't copy applications from machine to machine but we install them. Bob
