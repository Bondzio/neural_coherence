<s> Hi, my dads own a custom built server for my office, networking 6 computers. </s>
<s> I've heard that many servers have a UPS for back-up and I believe he needs one too. </s>
<s> Does anyone know the good, reliable companies? </s>
<s> I'd appriaciate any help. </s>
<s> Quad-CPU Configuration (3.06GHz X 4) 2048 MB of Memory Dual PSU's I'll post again when I have the complete specs. </s>
<s> -Thank You Ibrahim </s>
<s> A popular brand is APC. </s>
<s> You can look them up on the web. </s>
<s> It may, however, not be enough just to buy one, plug it in, and connect a PC. </s>
<s> You need to ask yourself a few questions about your needs. </s>
<s> First, what &quot;size&quot; do you need. </s>
<s> These are usually measured in KVA and manufacturers have charts to assist in your decision. </s>
<s> Next, do you want the server or PC to respond to power outages by shutting down or preparing to do so. </s>
<s> Software for some UPSs will do this. </s>
<s> If it's just to arrest short term outages or sags, you may not need an auto-shutdown feature. </s>
<s> The APC brand is widely available as is Belkin as a relative newcommer to the market. </s>
<s> You can find these in computer stores or on the web. </s>
<s> If you want heaver duty equipment, Powervar is another option. </s>
<s> You will not pick these up at CompUSA, however. </s>
<s> You would need to find a local distributor. </s>
<s> The Powervar systems offer both electrical isolation and battery backup in the same box. </s>
<s> At home, mine are APC. </s>
<s> At work, we buy Powervar. </s>
<s> I have used them for years and haven't had any problems. </s>
<s> I would recommend getting a battery backup, instead of just a surge protector. </s>
<s> APC and Triplett are usually the most common names you can trust. </s>
<s> There are others, but since you mention a business, you can pay for the &quot;insurance of a dependable UPS&quot; is worth it. </s>
<s> Others maybe well cheaper but are more meant for a home system once you look into the demands of what you need. </s>
<s> I would suggest you get not only what you need but see if a more &quot;reserve or uptime&quot; is required for a &quot;quick backup and shutdown period&quot;. </s>
<s> APC, has a support website and I'm sure Triplett does too, details on what they offer and what's needed for your demands. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> 1500. </s>
<s> I like it alot and it will give up to 30 min. </s>
<s> You can also buy an add-on battery for a few hours more. </s>

<s> it luks good, and its APC. </s>
<s> I just need it to stay on for like 12 minutes to quickly create a back-up and and shut-down correctly! </s>
<s> Thanks alot for all your help every1! </s>
<s> -Ibrahim </s>
<s> I'm been searching the web in vain for evaluation of UPS (battery backup/surge protector)devices. </s>
<s> Thanks for addressing the brand name question. </s>
<s> Any other opinions or experiences on best value and most reliability of UPS devices? </s>
<s> I'm shopping for high reliability for my wife's business equipment. </s>
<s> Money is no object -- I don't want to hear computer crash spousal complaints after one of Atlanta's (very) frequent power outages. </s>
<s> The OS systems are XP with lots of gadgets, coaxial, and phone line attached. </s>
<s> APC is probably the best known and make both consumer level and business level products. </s>
<s> The company I work for has switched from APC to Powervar. </s>
<s> They have a web site. </s>
<s> Depending on how much equipment you need, you might be able to get a representative from one of these companies come to your site, evaluate your needs and make a recommendation. </s>
<s> You will have to be willing to sit through sales pitches and may wind up more confused than before. </s>
<s> You will not get the best information specific to your needs by asking forum members here who don't know your goals. </s>
<s> A good company such as APC, Powervar, and others can come to the site of business and attach line monitoring devices that can record surges, sags and other electrical events. </s>
<s> Knowing how good or bad these electrical conditions are is the only way to tailor the best solution for you (your wife, that is). </s>
<s> If your electrical power is suspect, that's the only way to get it right. </s>
<s> Yes, it will cost but don't tell a sales rep that, as you said, &quot;Money is no object&quot;. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
