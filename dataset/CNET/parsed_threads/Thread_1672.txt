<s> Hey guys, I just moved to a new apartment where I'm surrounded by a lot of businesses that offer free wifi access. </s>
<s> My question is, can I just latch on to their connection(s) and say goodbye to my ISP? </s>
<s> What it comes down to is, I don't need a land line or cable tv - I just want high-speed internet as cheaply (yet ethically) as possible. </s>
<s> Is this feasible, and what kind of equipment do I need? </s>
<s> (running Win98, standard PC with PCI slot) Thanks for any advice - I've been on dialup for years and have no idea how wifi works. </s>

<s> Look up... WIFI EVIL TWIN to understand this new threat. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ah, I hadn't even heard of the evil twin thing. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info! </s>
<s> I will totally get permission - bad karma I don't need! </s>
<s> BUT - do you have any suggestions on what equipment I need? </s>
<s> Is it a Wireless Network Adapter? </s>
<s> Or a router? </s>
<s> Or what..? </s>
<s> Thanks again ... eve </s>
<s> While inaccurate in my book, that usually gets the finger pointing at a shelf full of choices. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Safest way is to get your own Internet service. </s>
<s> It will also be more convenient and you can make the service calls to the ISP when there is trouble. </s>
<s> Some cable, DSL, and other broadband Internet services are getting cheaper. </s>
<s> Some entry level services are as low as $14.95/month. </s>
<s> If you do use wireless hotspots or share someone else's service (with permission), you computer will need a wirless network adapter. </s>
<s> Many newer notebooks ship with an internal wireless adapter. </s>
<s> If yours doesn't, you can get a PC-Card or external USB wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Get a wireless-g (802.11g) compatible adapter for high compatibility. </s>
<s> Wireless-g is compatible with wireless-g and wireless-b networks. </s>
<s> You can get a wireless-a/g adapter that is compatible with a, b, and g networks. </s>
