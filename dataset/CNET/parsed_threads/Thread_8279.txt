<s> My new system I built has a Shuttle AN35N Ultra 400 system board with an AMD 2400+ processor, 2 Gig speed. </s>
<s> After getting it running I noticed in Device Manager the processor was shown as AMD 1800+ with a 1.4 Gig processor. </s>
<s> After a phone call to the store where I bought it I changed the FSB from 100 MHz to 133 MHz, and the listing went to 2400+, speed 2.0 Gig. </s>
<s> Now it's showing correctly, running like a top. </s>
<s> Can overclocking be this simple? </s>
<s> Change the FSB speed? </s>
<s> Not that I want to experiment, but if the FSB speed is increased, will the processor speed increase? </s>
<s> I do have more options. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> and then you get to fool with voltages, and then with... </s>
<s> The AMD 2400+ should have been set to &quot;factory specs&quot; of Multiplier of 15, FSB 133 and voltage 1.65 in the first place though. </s>
<s> With the 100 Mhz you were underclocking yours. </s>
<s> http://www.computing.net/cpus/wwwboard/forum/8145.html Play around with it (if you fry it they are pretty cheap). </s>
<s> Stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not OC but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference. </s>
<s> Had a Pentium Pro 200 that I ran at 266 for three years without problem and a Pentium Pro 166 that I clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months. </s>
<s> Thanks, interesting site. </s>
<s> I left everything at default, the only thing I changed was the clock in the BIOS, and the FSB setting. </s>
<s> I may try to play around with it later on. </s>

<s> Wayne: I have had the 2400+ for 15 months now. </s>
<s> When I put it together I set the bus at 136 and it runs at 2045, at 137 it goes to 2061 and 138 it runs at 2076. </s>
<s> If I go above 138 bus it is not stable.......need a bigger PS. </s>
<s> At the speeds we are talking about, performance gain is minimal. </s>
<s> If you got $ to throw away, donate to charity. </s>
<s> I feel it is more of a &quot;bragging&quot; thing. </s>
<s> Oooooo your 2ghz runs at 2.05ghz....WOW! </s>
<s> I agree completely. </s>
<s> If I could overclock it to 3 Gig it might be worth it. </s>
<s> But it replaced my 1 Gig machine. </s>
<s> There is a difference. </s>
