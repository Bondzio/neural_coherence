1.1.1	I'm trying to set up a new PC for a school principal.	St
1.1.2	Basic hardware is as follows: Intel MB model DG33FBC Intel quad corp CPU 2 gigs of RAM Hard drives = 2 Seagate SATA DVD-RW of unknown brand on IDE channel XP loaded fine and PC works well.	St
1.1.3	What I am noticing is that if I boot from DOS floppies or DOS boot images on CDs, no CD ROM device can be detected.	St
1.1.4	These same boot CDs work in the many other systems I have access to.	St
1.1.5	Even the Windows 98 boot disk on floppy fails to configure a CD ROM device using the standard mscdex and oak driver that works on every other device I have tried.	St
1.1.6	Strangely enough, I can put a known good CD ROM from one of these other PCs in the new one and get the same failure message so I know it's not the DVD-RW.	St
1.1.7	At first I thought it was something to do with the IDE channel but can also boot from USB connected CD ROM with the same result.	St
1.1.8	BTW, the CDs I'm using are ones I made myself to run DOS based utilities and just contain the boot image and drivers from basic Win 98 boot disks on which I've edited the config.sys/autoexec.bat to point to the CD ROM drive letter and and launch the desired utility.	St
1.1.9	These all work in other machines.	St
1.1.10	Downloaded iso utility disks such as memtest86+ work fine.	St
1.1.11	It's only mine I'm thinking this is maybe a BIOS issue (BIOS current on this board) or maybe another driver needed than the old oak.	St
1.1.12	Any hints would be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	DOS drivers are far from automatic and becoming a lost art.	St
1.2.2	For me to address this I need to see the dos boot disk's CONFIG.SYS and autoexec.bat files so I can see where you missed it.	St
1.2.3	However why bother with DOS?	Sug
1.3.1	anyway, here's an example.	St
1.3.2	This runs Partition Magic 7's floppy set from a CD ROM.	St
1.3.3	PM needs something of a scratchpad to write to so, if not running from the floppy itself, it will use a ram drive.	St
1.3.4	I found this out when trying to create the PM CD without the ram drive.	St
1.3.5	It wouldn't work on an NTFS volume.	St
1.3.6	So maybe I need to check out Bart's again but didn't have much luck with those utils on the first try.	St
1.3.7	If you see anything that might help, I'd appreciate suggestions.	St
1.3.8	These files are simple edits of the DOS boot floppy from WIN 98.	St
1.3.9	I have another set from PM that also works if I add ramdrive.sys in a similar manner.	St
1.3.10	In looking at this one again, I may need to change the CD ROM drive letter but others I tried using letters further up the alphabet don't work either.	St
1.3.11	(config.sys) device=himem.sys /testmem:off device=oakcdrom.sys /D:mscd001 [COMMON] files=10 buffers=10 dos=high,umb stacks=9,256 devicehigh=ramdrive.sys /E 2048 lastdrive=z (autoexec.bat) @ECHO OFF set EXPAND=YES SET DIRCMD=/O:N set LglDrv=27 * 26 Z 25 Y 24 X 23 W 22 V 21 U 20 T 19 S 18 R 17 Q 16 P 15 set LglDrv=%LglDrv% O 14 N 13 M 12 L 11 K 10 J 9 I 8 H 7 G 6 F 5 E 4 D 3 C cls call setramd.bat %LglDrv% set temp=c:\ set tmp=c:\ path=%RAMD%:\;a:\;%CDROM%:\ copy command.com %RAMD%:\ &gt; NUL set comspec=%RAMD%:\command.com copy extract.exe %RAMD%:\ &gt; NUL copy readme.txt %RAMD%:\ &gt; NUL :EXT %RAMD%:\extract /y /e /l %RAMD%: ebd.cab &gt; NUL echo The diagnostic tools were successfully loaded to drive %RAMD%.	St
1.3.12	echo.	St
1.3.13	LH %ramd%:\MSCDEX.EXE /D:mscd001 /L:D D:\PQMAGIC	St
1.4.1	That's odd since it should be the one for your CD/DVD drive.	St
1.4.2	Since you don't supply make and model I can't offer a replacement or if such is even available.	St
1.4.3	FIX THAT IF YOU MUST BOOT DOS and get to the CD/DVD via DOS.	St
1.4.4	-&gt; In closing, what's the goal here?	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	The Oak CD ROM driver is the generic that's worked as long as I can remember and comes with Win98 and maybe DOS 6....but you knew that.	St
1.5.2	What I said in my first post was that even using CD ROMs with the new PC that work with this driver on other PCs won't work on this one with the Oak driver.	St
1.5.3	Ergo, common sense says to me that it's not the driver/drive combination that's the issue.	St
1.5.4	In any event, my goal is to be able to continue using a few old utilities I have that run in DOS.	St
1.5.5	The two I use most often are Drive Image and Partition Magic which I bought years ago but are now older versions and the outfit who produced these has been absorbed by Symantec.	St
1.5.6	I use these during PC maintenance in some volunteer work I do.	St
1.5.7	When loading the OS or other software, I take snapshots of the drive with Drive Image at intervals until the PC is ready and activated.	St
1.5.8	This allows me to quickly back out if something doesn't go according to plan.	St
1.5.9	I can also adjust partition sizes as user needs dictate and create something of a restore image that might come in handy in case of later disaster.	St
1.5.10	Since none of the PCs this place is buying these days come with floppy drives, I've made bootable CDs from the original disks.	St
1.5.11	Otherwise, I need to temporarily install a floppy drive and then remove it when done.	St
1.5.12	Such is why, when my CDs didn't work, I tried the floppy method but it failed as well.	St
1.5.13	I'm not pro at this as you are.	St
1.5.14	Such is why I came for help.	St
1.5.15	BTW, the place i do this for is a school that buys volume licensed software and often several PCs with identical hardware all at once.	St
1.5.16	I've been able to produce one build and clone the rest of the PCs when this happens and it's a great time saver.	St
1.5.17	They are licensed for PowerQuest products so this should all be legal.	St
1.5.18	But if the newer PCs will all be like this one, I'm sunk.	St
1.5.19	Thanks anyway.	Polite
1.6.1	Share make and model numbers of things.	St
1.6.2	Expert or not, no one could guess what dos cd/dvdrom driver to use here.	St
1.6.3	If this is asking too much please let me know.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	This is an Aopen model DSW2012PA-28 DVD/CD Rewritable drive.	St
1.7.2	It's on an IDE 80 conductor cable on the master port with nothing else attached to the cable.	St
1.7.3	I gave the MB info in my first post.	St
1.7.4	What I have just now done that I hadn't before is tested the Aopen drive in one of my personal machines with the bootable CDs.	St
1.7.5	It worked just fine in my PC with both CDs I tested.	St
1.7.6	I hadn't tried this to this point because, as I mentioned, I'd fairly well ruled out the drive as the problem by putting other DVD and CD ROM devices into this PC and having them fail to be recognized from both the IDE and USB ports with DOS disks.	St
1.7.7	I can run these CDs from an external drive in my personal PC so I know they work.	St
1.7.8	In any event, if a DOS driver exists for this Aopen drive, I can certainly find it and try it.	St
1.7.9	I was hoping to find someone who'd experienced this same issue and found a solution.	St
1.7.10	Perhaps the boot CD just needs to be a bit more sophisticated than what I've been able to produce.	St
1.7.11	I made plenty of coasters getting these working just right and one just can't have too many coasters anyway.	St
1.7.12	Thanks again.	Polite
1.7.13	I'll post back if I can sort this out.	Sug
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	http://www.google.com/search?q=DSW2012PA-28 finds only your post.	St
1.9.2	I've configured what must be thousands of CD/DVD drives for DOS bootdisks so while I've done this, it all comes back to make and model.	St
1.9.3	In one of your posts you claimed you knew DOS so that's why I just noted the config.sys item since old DOS heads would only need to be pointed to the one line.	Sug
1.9.4	Sorry that I misread you.	St
1.9.5	DOS may be too hard on today's owners.	St
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	There are two choices given...Native and Legacy.	St
1.10.2	I'm not certain what the difference is but neither worked.	St
1.10.3	I have lost one option with the BIOS update I did, however.	St
1.10.4	There seemed to be a way to disable the multicore processor function with the year old BIOS.	St
1.10.5	I was going to attempt that but cannot find it since the flash I did later in the day.	St
1.10.6	I don't think it would make a difference.	St
1.10.7	Thanks for taking a look at this.	St
1.10.8	It's not the end of the world.	St
1.10.9	I'll look at it as an opportunity to evolve and learn.	St
1.11.1	(in regard to making boot disks anyway) but I did not say I know all about DOS.	St
1.11.2	I'm not sure what the &quot;old DOS heads&quot; comment for.	Res
1.11.3	I'll try and not take it as an insult but my skin is quite thick in that regard.	St
1.11.4	Anyway, I believe Aopen products might be produced by some unspecified manufacturer and other drivers might be available to test.	St
1.11.5	This was as consideration until I dug a little further and found other evidence didn't match the notion that the driver was the issue.	St
1.11.6	It's quite easy to get far off the track when one's focus is too narrow and one reason for bringing the problem here was to see if that was possible.	St
1.11.7	Your replies suggest you believe it still to be a driver issue.	St
1.11.8	I respect your knowledge and experience.	Polite
1.11.9	You are right that DOS is old but so am I so moving forward comes to me a bit more slowly.	St
1.11.10	Obviously other methods of making boot CDs exist.	St
1.11.11	I'm just not sure what tools are needed to do such.	Res
1.11.12	It may just be that floppy emulation just isn't going to cut it in this case.	St
1.11.13	I will figure this out.	St
1.12.1	Or from the aopen web site I'll offer what a working config.sys and what file to put on the boot diskette.	St
1.12.2	It was not an insult but a lament.	St
1.12.3	I don't expect people to know this anymore.	St
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	http://www.bootdisk.com/dostools.htm VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	Happens with G31 too.	St
1.14.2	Never suspected and never needed it but it now appears to be a G3x weirdness.	St
1.14.3	MSCDEX loads driver but CD inaccessible with DIR from floppy bootdisk.	St
1.14.4	CD **can** be DIR'd if booted with DOS CD.	St
1.14.5	This with an optical and Mitsumi generic (Oak'ish) combo that works on older Intel (and AMD) chipset mobos.	St
1.14.6	Wonder if P3x has same issue?	St
1.14.7	Can someone with a P3x and a FDD please try it?	Sug
1.14.8	Maybe Intel can shed some light or release an update to enable this legacy function...NAH!!!	St
1.14.9	Sorry I queried your punctiliousness.	St
1.14.10	Should've known better.	St
1.15.1	as I am with ASUS but I don't know if that makes a big difference or not.	St
1.15.2	But even with the ASUS boards I preferred Intel chipsets and processors.	St
1.15.3	All of the other PCs I have the opportunity to work with are between 1 and 5 years of age and so this is a new one on me.	St
1.15.4	I tend to beat my head on a problem for quite a while before asking for help.	St
1.15.5	I've a fair layman's understanding of the process that takes place when loading the CD ROM driver and that failure messages don't always point to the exact cause of what went wrong.	St
1.15.6	In my case the message was that something like 'no valid CD ROM device was found' but I've learned to look at it this way as an example.	St
1.15.7	Someone could give you a master key to a certain brand of safe they owned and ask you to retrieve an item from it but, when you get to the building it's in, you find the door bolted.	St
1.15.8	You could report back that you couldn't find the item in the safe.	St
1.15.9	That would be a valid response even if you didn't mention that you couldn't even get through the front door to look for the safe.	St
1.15.10	Such is what I think may be happening when I try to boot this CD.	St
1.15.11	The &quot;key&quot; is good but I can't get to the lock and the failure message listing doesn't include this possibility.	St
1.15.12	It does sound from your message that my case isn't unique.	St
1.15.13	This is actually helpful and I thank you for the info.	Polite
1.15.14	I will be bruising my skull a bit more until this durned thing works.	St
1.16.1	After trying another method...an old &quot;Bart's&quot; (circa 2002) created utility that contains a variety of drivers...sort of like a building super's keychain...I'm finding a PCI controller issue.	St
1.16.2	This is a PCI express MB.	St
1.16.3	If I'm reading correctly, some differences exist in whats connected to the northbridge and southbridge between older PCI and PCI express.	St
1.16.4	I'm wondering if the old DOS drivers are just looking in the wrong place and I'd need an additional driver to redirect the search.	St
1.16.5	Starting to feel like Rip Van Winkle here.	St
1.17.1	What you supplied didn't cough it up.	St
1.17.2	Any hope?	St
1.18.1	and you've already said you can't find it and I haven't located it either when coupling the search with a DOS driver.	St
1.18.2	AOpen model DSW2012PA I can find generic CD ROM drivers including those for older AOpen models and, as I mentioned, the Oak driver worked with it just fine in another PC.	St
1.18.3	I've also put an ASUS CD ROM device in that rig that works fine with the Oak in the other PC as well but get an identical failure message with it in the new rig.	St
1.18.4	All of this has been mentioned.	St
1.19.1	And now I can go look.	St
1.19.2	See what you supplied last time.	St
1.19.3	It's slightly different and can't be found.	St
1.20.1	&quot;OS : Windows Vista/XP/2000&quot; http://usa.aopen.com/products_spec.aspx Try to find other CD drives and maybe we'll have better luck.	St
1.20.2	Bob	St
1.21.1	Model copied verbatim is DSW2012PA-28 on the BC label but another sticker omits the -28 .	St
1.22.1	http://www.bootdisk.com/readme.htm#cdromdos	St
1.23.1	I will probably give this up as a dead end cause.	St
1.23.2	I'll have another PC to deal with soon as the school secretary is also having her old one replaced.	St
1.23.3	It will have less robust hardware than the one I'm setting up now but will be another Intel MB.	St
1.23.4	We'll see what happens.	St
1.23.5	Things change and the old doesn't always work with the new.	St
1.23.6	You can't find leaded gasoline these days and, if you made your own, your car's sensors and computer would probably choke up and shut you down.	St
1.24.1	tekzilla covered this in episode 34 http://revision3.com/tekzilla/ghost/ they had a free drive imager http://www.clonezilla.org/ and for partition changing I belive they recomended a BartePE of Windows XP or the Linux Equivalent.	St
1.24.2	hope that helps..	St
1.25.1	Don't current versions of these tools come on a bootable CD?	St
1.25.2	You wouldn't need DOS then.	St
1.25.3	Kees	St
1.26.1	Drive Image 7 did anyway but I can't speak for Partition Magic 8 because I have 7 and only use the boot floppies.	St
1.26.2	Symantec took over and the license structure changed significantly requiring installation on a PC and activation of the product.	St
1.26.3	I have Drive Image 7 on one machine at home and it does have advantages but disadvantages as well.	St
1.26.4	Running from Windows creates some sort of virtual boot disk on the machine that's annoying if you have multiple boot drives.	St
1.26.5	You'd have to experience this to understand.	St
1.26.6	Such is why I use the boot floppies only.	St
1.26.7	Installation on the machine does have the advantage of being able to extract individual files and folders from the images.	St
1.26.8	I don't use that function.	St
1.26.9	As for Partition Magic, it's stricter licensing requiring installation and use on one machine only don't make much sense.	St
1.26.10	At 50 to 70 bucks a pop, you'd have to be constantly changing the partition structure to make this worth while.	St
1.26.11	I'll squeeze what I can get from what I have.	Ques
1.26.12	Thanks.	St
1.27.1	I've been looking at other options.	St
1.27.2	I can still clone just fine but with the added step of using a floppy instead of a CD.	St
1.27.3	I can even use a portable I believe.	St
1.27.4	Floppy media has a tendency to suddenly go bad so just need to make sure I remake a set or two now and then.	St
1.28.1	Well, maybe.	St
1.28.2	Preliminary testing looks promising.	St
1.28.3	This falls into the &quot;why didn't I think of that in the first place?&quot; category as I'd gotten stuck in the floppy emulation mode forgetting about hard drive emulation.	St
1.28.4	The two utilities I was trying to use each used 2 floppies and I couldn't find away to fit them on one nor did I have a 2.88 meg drive.	St
1.28.5	As such, it required a boot image with the drive letter change from A: to the designated CD ROM letter.	St
1.28.6	Such is why the need for the CD ROM driver to load.	St
1.28.7	I'd forgotten that Nero offered an option to make a boot image of a hard drive.	St
1.28.8	This just requires the partition size to be trimmed to fit a CD.	St
1.28.9	I first downloaded Caldera Open DOS and installed that to a hard drive as that's the OS my utils come with..but, for some reason, it would not boot saying some files were missing.	St
1.28.10	Fortunately I was able to clear the dust from a set of DOS 6.22 disks, load the OS and utility files and make a config.sys/autoexec.bat that would boot to Drive Image and run it successfully.	St
1.28.11	Nero was able to burn that hard drive image to a CD and it worked from there as well.	St
1.28.12	I'd still like to figure out what happened with Caldera and use that instead.	St
1.28.13	If this works well, it should allow me to put several utilities on the CD and select them from a menu.	St
1.28.14	CD ROM drivers??	St
1.28.15	We don't need no steeeenking CD ROM drivers.	St
