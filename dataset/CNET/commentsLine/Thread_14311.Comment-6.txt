a partition is an area of the physical disk dedicated to an operating system according to the file system/ hierarchy.
what the previous person stated isn't true.
windows uses a style of partitioning that is similar to the default bsd style of &quot;slicing a disk.&quot; you are not creating partitions, you are creating dedicated areas within the partition.
there is no c or d drives in the layout of the master boot record.
you only have four primary; and, if you want more then you must only create three primary and have number four separated into logical sections.
you cannot resize a partition from within itself and you cannot do such without permissions as the root user.
you view the partitions with fdisk.
if you want to resize, then use an external device such as a live cd or a usb installed os.
i suggest knoppix.
