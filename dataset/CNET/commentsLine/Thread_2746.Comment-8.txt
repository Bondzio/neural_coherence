i'm experiencing the same problem that others have noted here ie when i try to access my buffalo linkstation 250gb network drive, i get the dreaded &quot;the network path was not found&quot; message.
what's so frustrating is that my linkstation has been installed and working on the same system for over a year, no real problems.
this problem just cropped up in the past week or so.
i'm able to access all the drive settings via the web interface, and the ip configuration utility immediately scans and finds the drive.
i've received a couple of responsed from buffalo tech support, but none of their suggestions has worked for me so far.
i'm running xpmce on a dell 8400, cable modem.
my linkstation is attached to a d-link 614 wireless router.
so far i have tried: * using the \\ip method to address the drive * manually changing the ip address to a fixed value * disabling firewall software (sygate) * disabling av (norton v2005) * disabling windows defender * renaming the drive * runing the disk scan/repair utility * moving the linkstation away from other equipment * removing/reinstalling client for ms networks and file and printer sharing * changing the tcp/ip win/advanced setting to enable netbios i use the drive mainly as a backup source, and i don't think there is too much on there that would be lost, but not having the frequent (nightly) backups of my essential data files is causing me concern.
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
