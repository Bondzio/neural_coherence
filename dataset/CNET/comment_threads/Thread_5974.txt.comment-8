If available, you can reset the NOD32 config, to &quot;NOT&quot; scan during boot-up.
You will need to scan manually or at some set time frame.
Also, if not restable, then delete the whole NOD32 setup, once done, reboot.
Then re-install it and pay attention to the scan options, then and make non-scan during boot.
At least most AV scanner provide this option.
