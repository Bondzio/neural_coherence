<s> I have a Desktop PC and a Laptop I can connect the Laptop wirelessly to the Net, but am unable to print to the printer connected to my Desktop PC or share any of the files. </s>
<s> Any ideas please?. </s>
<s> Many thanks for any help/advice. </s>
<s> need to be addressed for this to work.... 1) file and print sharing enabled 2) workgroup names the same 3) some folder set to be shared 4) the printer set to be shared and last but not least 5) your firewalls set to allow this type of LAN traffic </s>
<s> Thanks I will give it a go. </s>
