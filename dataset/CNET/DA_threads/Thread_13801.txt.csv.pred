1.1.1	I have a Toshiba external 160GB hard drive ( http : //www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Portable-External-Drive-HDDR160E03X/dp/B0013FXWLK/ref=sr_1_18 ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1266766167 & sr=8-18 ) .	St
1.1.2	The cable that connects the drive to the computer is starting to fail .	St
1.1.3	I would like to buy a replacement .	St
1.1.4	I know that it is NOT the harddrive because this happened before .	St
1.1.5	I contacted Toshiba and they sent me the only cable they had .	St
1.1.6	But it did not work .	St
1.1.7	They suggested I buy a replacement cable from any computer store , which I did , and that did not work either .	St
1.1.8	The usb cable that comes with the harddrive ( http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B002BW6DBU/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0 ? ie=UTF8 & index=0 ) has what looks like a section that can provide more power to the driver so it can run efficiently .	St
1.1.9	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	All you need to do is match the connectors .	St
1.2.2	The types that offer a second power connector will sometimes work better as not all USB ports can provide the same amount of current .	St
1.2.3	Sometimes , however , an apparent cable failure is a poor connection at the device itself .	St
1.2.4	These are n't always easy to troubleshoot .	St
1.2.5	Another option might be to buy another external enclosure that comes with its own cable and put the hard drive in that .	St
1.2.6	You 'd have to pull the drive out to make sure it 's no some proprietary design .	St
1.2.7	I 've heard that some external drives have the USB connection as part of the controller rather than an SATA to internal adapter .	St
1.2.8	Since you did n't ask any specific question such as & quot ; will this work & quot ; or & quot ; what should I do & quot ; , that 's about all I can offer .	St
1.2.9	You try and find a cable with the extra power connector or try another enclosure .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite

1.4.1	What makers do n't tell you is that USB powered drives are notoriously unreliable .	St
1.4.2	I can take a model that did n't work on the owner 's machine and plug it into some rear USB port of a desktop and it works .	St
1.4.3	It 's a shame they produced this product without taking into account & quot ; the real world. & quot ; Bob	St
