<s> I have a question about the external hard drive. </s>
<s> If i get one and plug it into my pc via usb 2.0, will the external hard drive show up as a removable device? </s>
<s> I have an external hard drive and whenever I plug it in it shows up as my F: drive . </s>
<s> When I look in My Computer it shows up as saying Local Disk (F). </s>
<s> I don't see it say anywhere that its a removable drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helped. </s>
<s> in the drive's Policies (Device Manager, Disk Drives, Properties, Poilicies tab), you can configure the write caching as safe removable as &quot;optimize for quick removal&quot; or &quot;optimize for performance&quot;. </s>
<s> if optimizing for performance, a write cache will be setup in the OS and you'll need to use the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon to save any pending data. </s>
<s> the quick removal option will allow you unplug the drive once the activity led turn off. </s>
<s> I have an Seagate 160 gig in an external USB 2.0 case. </s>
<s> Yes, it will show up as and removable drive. </s>
<s> Works well. </s>
