1.1.1	I 've chatted with HP support and they suggested I buy a new printer .	St
1.1.2	It 's an HP 1315v all in one and we 're running XP .	St
1.1.3	It will print a full page on 20 lb paper but will only print two inches of the same image ( with PSP ) on 61 lb matte photo paper .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried all the settings and the printer will pick up the matte paper , and it just stops printing but wo n't eject the paper itself , I have to push the on button for it to eject the paper .	St
1.1.5	I 've never had this problem before and it 's been a really good printer .	St
1.1.6	I blame the fact that I just spent $ $ on new cartridges .	St
1.1.7	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? docname=c01578373 & tmp_task=prodinfoCategory & lc=en & dlc=en & cc=us & product=374575 & lang=en That card stock of that weight is listed .	St
1.2.2	But to test if the printer has failed is hard on owners .	St
1.2.3	We have to test it on another PC .	St
1.2.4	If the printer has failed then we get a cost estimate and compare that to the replacement cost .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Gotcha .	St
1.3.2	I 've got a laptop around here somewhere I can test it on .	St
1.3.3	Never crossed my mind ( where did I leave my mind anyway ) to do that .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for the kick in the behind !	St
