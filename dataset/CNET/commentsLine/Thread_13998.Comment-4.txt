if yes...you do not need to reinstall xp home before upgrading to xp pro.
all you need do is start the xp pro upgrade and when it asks about the os to be upgraded ...you put in the xp home cd.
once the xp home is verified, put the xp pro cd in and finish the install.
if it doesn't work ...lemme know.
