hey im trying to overclock my graphics card which is a EVGA GTX 7800 256mb but i dont know what to set the core and memory to.
I have coolbits 2 and so far i have only overclocked my core to 465 and the memory to 1.26. stock the core is 430 and the mem is 2.0. i have tried to go higher but it wouldnt let me.
i hear that some people get the card to 480(core) and 1.3(mem)i just want to know if im at good OC settings for my card or should i get a new progrem or something that will let me take it to 480 and 1.3. thanks, nick
