i have a toshiba external 160gb hard drive (  ).
the cable that connects the drive to the computer is starting to fail.
i would like to buy a replacement.
i know that it is not the harddrive because this happened before.
i contacted toshiba and they sent me the only cable they had.
but it did not work.
they suggested i buy a replacement cable from any computer store, which i did, and that did not work either.
the usb cable that comes with the harddrive (  ) has what looks like a section that can provide more power to the driver so it can run efficiently.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance.
