1.1.1	ok i want to build a new puter but dont know everything i need to do it.	St
1.1.2	can someone give me a list of parts and software for a good media center and gaming pc with tv tuner.	St
1.1.3	for parts totalling 1000-1500 dollars -blazerdude20@yahoo.com	St
1.2.1	If you want to build a computer you better take the time and effort to learn what is needed to accomplish the task.	St
1.2.2	The research is part of the process.	St
1.2.3	A couple of very good magazines to buy are MaximumPC & CPU.	St
1.3.1	Here are the basic parts you are going to need: Case Motherboard CPU GPU (optional, but highly recommended) Sound Card (optional) HDD Optical Drives PSU And the peripherals including mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, etc.	St
1.3.2	Much can be bought for that much.	St
1.3.3	Ok, to explaining.	St
1.3.4	Case is simple: It is what your PC is inside.	St
1.3.5	Gamers want flashy, MC's want simple, yet elegant.	St
1.3.6	Look toward Thermaltake.Motherboard is what I like to call the skeleton of the computer.	St
1.3.7	Everything is connected to it: CD, HDD, PSU, GPU, CPU, Sound, everything.	St
1.3.8	Look for ASUS.	St
1.3.9	CPU is what I call the brains.	St
1.3.10	A long myth of computers was the the higher the &quot;clock&quot; speed of a CPU the faster.	St
1.3.11	Clock is how many cycles it can perform.	St
1.3.12	For example, a 2.8Ghz can perform 2,800 cycles.	St
1.3.13	There are two companies that are worth a look, and in total accumlate about 90% of all comptuters in the world, minus Macs.	St
1.3.14	(But not for long!	St
1.3.15	http://news.cbsi.com/Apple+to+ditch+IBM,+switch+to+Intel+chips/2100-1006_3-5731398.html ) The two companies are: The world famous and major CPU maker: Intel and a newer company AMD.	St
1.3.16	Intel is a majority, but IMHO is going to lose the overall fight.	St
1.3.17	Intel has faster clock speeds, but AMD is just better.	St
1.3.18	AMD can do more with less.	St
1.3.19	Go with AMD!	St
1.3.20	Recently, there has been much talk of Dual Core.	St
1.3.21	Two cpus.	St
1.3.22	Wait in Januray, then look for some measures of speed (benchmarks).	St
1.3.23	Get the AMD X2 series.	St
1.3.24	Literally beats Intel, kind of caught Intel with their pants down.	St
1.3.25	Now to may favorite part.	St
1.3.26	You got your GPUS!	St
1.3.27	Two companies, again, Nvidia and ATI.	St
1.3.28	Nvidia, right now, is faster.	St
1.3.29	This GPU thing is a cat and mouse game.	St
1.3.30	One is faster today, tommorow is the other, so on and so on.	St
1.3.31	Right now its Nvidia's Turn.	St
1.3.32	Go with SLi of two 7800 GTs.	St
1.3.33	Getting tired, so my explaintations may get weaker.	St
1.3.34	Sound card: Simple.	St
1.3.35	For sound.	St
1.3.36	Get X-Fi.	St
1.3.37	Cheapest will be fine.HDD: Big: 300GB minimum.Optical: DL DVD Burner.PSU: Antec minimum 550W.	St
1.3.38	I going to assume you understood very little of this if your new, but then again I may underestimate you.	St
1.3.39	Respond back for questions.	St

1.8.4	go higher if u want.	Sug
1.8.5	6800gs....7800gtx....	St
1.9.1	contact a local system builder and work with them because you will get a much better computer system and best of all it will be more upgradable and expandable for future growth unlike the big name computers and ones you buy in stores.	Sug
1.9.2	For 1000-1500 you can get an awesome system.. i just priced a system for a customer with an AMD 64 4000+, 1gig ram, 80 gigHD(he didn't want anything bigger), DVD burner,Geforce 7800GTX video with 256 meg, all built on an ASUS motherboard and it came to $1399.	St
1.9.3	That's with Windows XP Pro w/service pack 2 installed.. so for 1000-1500 you can get a nice system.	St
