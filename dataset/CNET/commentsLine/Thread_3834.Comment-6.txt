i have been using the ecs k7s5a pro version 5 for a while with no problems that weren't of my own making.
this is what i suspect here.
i have win 98se and linux fedora core 1. neither have given me any problems.
you have to install the drivers from the mobo disc for everything, just like any other mobo.
this includes cmedia sound and usb 2.0. they are all on the disc.
browse your disc, think about what you are looking at.
post back if you have any more problems.
good luck.
