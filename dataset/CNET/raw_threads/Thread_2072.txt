I just bought a 500gb drive for my computer and I've run into a bit of a problem. I have 2 80gb drives running RAID0 on my MSI 875P-Neo FIS2R and it worked fine through the 1st and 2nd SATA connections. I plugged in my new 500gb drive to the 3rd (and then tried 4th) SATA and no luck, it wouldn't recognize the drive. To troubleshoot, I plugged in my working RAID0 array into the 3rd and 4th SATA and it wouldn't recognize those either. I have concluded that either the 3rd and 4th SATA connections on my computer are broken, or they are somehow disabled and I don't know how to activate them. I took a peek in BIOS at the ATA configurations and couldn't find anything that would totally disable the 2nd set of SATA Any help? I hope my board isn't broken because the warranty is up for sure by now Thanks for your time

Also in full mode where all IDE and SATA works stresses people new to this since it requires XP to be fed SATA motherboard drivers during install or XP declares there is no hard disks. This is all I can share since you didn't tell which mode you used. Bob

Here are the current settings that work for me, and the source of the problem might be here: Bios-&gt;Integrated Peripherals-&gt;On-chip IDE ------------------------------------------ On-Chip ATA(s) Operate Mode - Native Mode ATA Configuration - S-ATA Only P-ATA Keep Enabled - Yes P-ATA Channel Selection - Both S-ATA Ports Definition - P0-1st/P1-2nd Configure S-ATA as RAID - Yes Thanks for your time, if I can't get this to work in the next few days I'm shipping it back to newegg
13900	4	259978	2563781	2563408	R. Proffitt	8/15/07 11:08 PM	1.18721928E12	You found it.	&quot;S-ATA Ports Definition - P0-1st/P1-2nd Configure S-ATA as RAID - Yes&quot; Yup, you have it in the friendly mode but it will be limited to only 2 SATA drives and the others must be in some RAID mode (more than 1 drive). You found the issue and returning it may be exchanging one board for yet another with the same feature and issues. Here's the problem in a nutshell. If you enable the full mode of all sata ports then you run into XP declaring there are no hard disks. To get around that, research HOW TO INSTALL XP TO A SATA DRIVE on google.com Bob
13900	5	259978	2564326	2563781	clock3d	8/16/07 1:53 PM	1.18727238E12	Hmm	I'm a little confused on the query you wanted me to look into 'HOW TO INSTALL XP TO A SATA DRIVE' because I already have XP on my RAID 0 array of 2x60GB drives. This query is giving me information on how to install the RAID controllers so XP recognizes it for a new partition installation. And also for just 1 or 2 drives. My case is 3 drives. In case you misunderstood my first post: My RAID 0 works fine but my 3rd SATA HDD hookup (the 500gb seagate) won't be recognized. If I enable 'full mode' for the S-ATA config in BIOS (and how would I do that? for the ports definition my other option is P0-2nd/P1-1st) how would I go about making XP recognize the drives? If I install vista would this all go away or is it the same problem? Thanks for your help, we're almost there but I'm still a bit stuck
13900	6	259978	2564328	2564326	R. Proffitt	8/16/07 2:00 PM	1.1872728E12	Yup, It's a tough area to grasp.	It took me more than a few times to grasp what was going on so keep at it. In a nutshell your BIOS is faking 2 SATA drives to look like they are actually IDE drives. This has made it easier for XP owners to get their OS installed without the mandatory F6 and a driver diskette during the install but now you have hit the next issue. How will you get more than 2 SATA channels working. I noted how but I see you are still digesting the changes in how things work. My best advice is to keep reading and asking until someone finds the right words for you. Vista is a fair solution since Microsoft finally added SATA support. For XP we use the BIOS as a crutch if the owner/installer won't deal with the usual F6 and diskette install. Bob
13900	7	259978	2564327	2564326	clock3d	8/16/07 2:00 PM	1.1872728E12	also...	Also, I forgot to include that the 500gb is just going to be my extra/backup drive so I don't need to install Windows XP or anything on it, I just need it to get enabled so I can transfer stuff on it inside XP
13900	8	259978	2564441	2564328	clock3d	8/16/07 4:31 PM	1.18728186E12	well...	I have SATA drivers installed that create the RAID 0 array, and I did do the F6 and diskette thing to install my RAID drivers. So BIOS is limiting to only 2 SATA drives so XP will understand? That sucks...so is it impossible to use more than 2 SATA drives on an XP machine, because thats bizzare. I'll look into if vista will help my problem, thanks a lot so far, I appreciate the help (MSI has no tech support...lol)
13900	9	259978	2564446	2564441	clock3d	8/16/07 4:38 PM	1.18728228E12	and	Also (hehe sorry) what settings would I put in BIOS if I installed Vista? Right now the screen after POST is my RAID set-up screen and the 500gb isn't detected, just the 2x60gb drives so how do I open up the SATA ports 3-4 if I put Vista?
13900	10	259978	2564447	2564441	R. Proffitt	8/16/07 4:41 PM	1.18728246E12	RAID is not SATA.	Sorry but these are not the same. Let me try again in a nutshell. Enable the full mode of the bios where all channels are enabled. The OS should fail to boot since it's not ready to work from SATA. As long as you are using that mixed mode you have a 4 drive limit just like on old IDE machines. Bob
13900	11	259978	2564448	2564446	R. Proffitt	8/16/07 4:44 PM	1.18728264E12	Oopd in regard to that BIOS setting.	Yes, you need to enable the full mode (sorry I don't have your motherboard/bios manual so I have to use the last board's terminology I installed to.) You'll know when you get it since all the drives will show in the bios screens. Bob
