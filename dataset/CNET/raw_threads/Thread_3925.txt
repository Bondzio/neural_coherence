No one is actively marketing these and there are faster, better, more current CPUs and more for free on freecycle which as you may know is a &quot;free&quot; way to recycle older or such items. You may value these but frankly what you need to find is someone that doesn't know about freecycle as well has a need for these parts plus some cash to give you for them. Bob
