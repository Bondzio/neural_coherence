the catalyst control center has a feature called overdirve, i've played around with it and havn't really got any performance boost.also when i do use overdrive it says requested clocks peed and current clock speed, the requested shows what i entered and current shows well current clock speed.my post was actually more asking how far i could go not if i could do it.thanks anyway.
by the way i also tried ati tool.
