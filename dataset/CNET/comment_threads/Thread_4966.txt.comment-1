Hiya peoples I have just upgraded my computer and am having difficulty getting sound..
I have...ecsk7s5a mother board and pentium 4.. no sound card at the mo..
I have checked all bois settings and as far as i can see they are correct.. got all drivers including the sound driver.. checked the bios and ac97 is enabled and still no sound from the speakers.. i know my speakers work as i tested them on another machine.
I am a real newb at anything outside of windows so any advice on how to &quot;get some bloomin sound&quot; would be a bonus.. Any tips???
thanks in advance.. willy
