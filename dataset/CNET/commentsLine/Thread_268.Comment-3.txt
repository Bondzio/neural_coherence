thanks bill - correct, i don't want to run wires all over the house.
the ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what i want to do.
would the linksys wet610n or similar be the device i would need.
also, do you know if they make one of these with multi-port?
since i'm hooking up the dish receiver, if there is a multi-port device i could use the same device to hook-up the blu-ray and tv.
i didn't think about those yesterday.
again, thanks for the help.
