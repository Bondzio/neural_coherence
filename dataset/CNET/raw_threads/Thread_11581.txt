I'm looking for the best wireless router that has the fastest speed and the best range. I got confused with &quot;Belkin N1 Vision, netgear wndr3700, and linksys WRT610N&quot; I don't know what the best one is and I don't know what the best modem (ADSL2+) to connect with any of them is. May any one advise me or help with that, please? I'm looking for the best speed range modem (ADSL2+) no detachable BTW: I don't care about electricity and I need something no more than $500 My net speed is 4MB. Warm regards,

For the range, specify your needs (10 feet, 100 feet, 1000 feet?) in open air. Then find a shop and buy one that conforms. Kees

Thank you Kees Bakker for your comment Actually I'm using Thomson TG585 v7 and it's G not N so it is too slow and its range is too bad. My house has built from concrete and bricks. for the range, I need something more than 1000 ft In my country there are no Linksys WRT610N and Netgear WNDR3700, so I will order everything from amazon or any website. regards, Khaled
