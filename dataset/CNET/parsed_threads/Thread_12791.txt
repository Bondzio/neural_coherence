<s> Hi, I recently got a Toshiba Satellite E105 laptop and I was wondering how to wipe my hard drive absolutely clean of everything (including OS and partitions) and start over, installing my Windows 7 RC dvd onto a 2 GB (or so) partition and leaving the rest of the hard drive's space on a second partition, assuming that's a wise way to set up a hard drive...? </s>
<s> I already tried installing W7 RC only to find that there was already an OEM reserved partition where Vista is, so I was only able to install W7 RC on the larger of the two partitions, and I'm pleased to report that W7 seems great, but I'd like to re-install it onto a cleaned-up hard drive that doesn't have a big Windows.old folder taking up a bunch of space. </s>
<s> So could you tell me how to set my hard drive up that way for my next attempt at a W7 RC installation? </s>
<s> So to summarize, I first want to completely wipe my hard drive clean, which currently contains two separate partitions: one small OEM-created Vista partition and the main one now containing W7 RC. </s>
<s> From there, I want to set my hard drive up with one small partition I can install W7 RC on and another main one for storage and stuff, unless you hard drive experts think it's wiser to set a laptop up differently... Also, as a side question, could you tell me if a hard drive backup image includes everything like partitioning, etc, or if it only contains the OS, software, data, and things like that? </s>
<s> Because I should probably make a backup image before doing anything drastic. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time! </s>
