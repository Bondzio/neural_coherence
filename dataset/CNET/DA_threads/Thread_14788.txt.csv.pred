1.1.1	Hello , I have recently installed Windows 98 SE on my computer and do n't have any sound .	St
1.1.2	It showed my sound card in the device manager , but there were no playback devices listed under Multimedia in the Control Panel .	St
1.1.3	Now , after trying to uninstall and reinstall the sound card driver many times , I do not show the sound card listed in the device manager , and I have not been able to get a playback device to show in Multimedia no matter what I have tried : changing Bios configuration under Audio from Auto to Enabled to Disabled to Auto uninstalling and reinstalling driver and updated drivers reinstalling Multimedia in Windows 98 I am contemplating reformatting my hard disk drive and reinstalling Windows & quot ; from scratch & quot ; , but I 'm not sure what to do differently this time from the last time I did this .

1.1.6	Operating system : Windows 98 SE Sound card : Realtek AC'97 HP Pavilion computer converted from Windows XP to Windows 98 SE 40 GB hard disk drive currently partitioned , with Windows 98 SE in a 7.85 GB partition at the beginning of the drive	St
1.2.1	& quot ; HP Pavilion computer converted from Windows XP to Windows 98 SE & quot ; Some HP computers that came with XP have NO WINDOWS 98 driver .	St
1.2.2	You would use one from hp.com ( click on the drivers link ) , but a few and even moreso now will never see a Windows 98 driver .	St
1.2.3	The fix is to disable the onboard audio and install a sound card with 98 drivers .	St
