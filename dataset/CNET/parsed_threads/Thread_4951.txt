<s> After switching from PC to Mac and hooking up my MP730 my prints all turn out at about 50% or smaller, jammed up into a corner of the letter size sheets. </s>
<s> I've looked through all the preferences, print menus, etc to no avail. </s>
<s> It happens everytime, no matter what the program is I'm printing from - Word, a Web page, Photoshop, etc. </s>
<s> This never happened when hooked up to my PC. </s>
<s> I can't find drivers for the MP730 on Apple's site, so don't know what to do or whom to contact. </s>
<s> Advice anyone? </s>
<s> Is it Mac compatible? </s>
<s> If so, go to the manufacturer's website and download the Mac drivers from there and install them. </s>
<s> Evidently Mac &quot;plug & play&quot; didn't handle that model right. </s>

<s> If you have a Canon Multifunction MP730 and switched to a Mac, you can indeed print to it (but not fax/scan) by buying a copy of PrintFab http://www.printfab.net/ At $100 it's not cheap, but it does a great job and works reliably. </s>
