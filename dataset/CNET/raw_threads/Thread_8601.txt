Anyway I'm just trying to find out if a Pentium D925 is compatible with an ASUS P5WD2 Premium. I think it is but I'm not 100%. Plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core. I would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that I can put in there is, within financial reason. Of course that changes with time so I would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so I can watch as the prices drop. Thanks JW

It seems the mtrbd. is open to both single and dual core cpus. You can use a vendor website as well to show what cpu installs to like so: http://www.shopbot.ca/p-32123.html Intel socket 775 tada -----Willy

Like the MOBO comparison chart, that site in there constantly eludes me. Don' ask why...it's what u get when u cross an elephant and a rhino......Elephino (hellifIknow)hehehe. I've been locked up too long. Anyway this is just what I needed.. Thanks guys. What is keeping the price of those Extreme Edition processors up so high?? 11, 12 hundred bucks hell they've got quads hitting th market now.... I want one of those EE to get below at least 5 bills....WHEN???
