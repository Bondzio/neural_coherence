i recently overclocked an amd x4 965 way to much and fried it.
so, i bought another one and it is sitting here next to me.
what i need to know is, when i put the new cpu in, will the previous cpu's overclocked settings be active?
i would think not, because i'd just end up frying another cpu.
i just want to be 100% sure before i lose another $180.
thanks -jred13
