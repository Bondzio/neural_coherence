Laptop running Win Vista wired/wireless (wireless preferred) and I'm trying to connect them both together in such a way that I may transfer files between the 2 computers. They are both going through a wireless router and both have internet access with out any problems. I've searched the web looking for tutorials, but all end in complete failure. so ANY help would be much appreciated. If I'm missing details please ask and I'll add ASAP
