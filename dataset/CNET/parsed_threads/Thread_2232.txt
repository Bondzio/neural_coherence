<s> I recently bougth this DVD/RW, but the problem is that I can't hear the sound of some DVDs, for instance I got the VH1 Divas Live 1998, and it comes with 2 music tracks, I can hear one of then but the other one is mute, the tracks are (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), (Dolby Digital 5.1). </s>
<s> Why can I hear just one of them? </s>
<s> What should I do in order to hear both tracks? </s>

<s> do as Michael recommended? </s>
<s> Also, when you open a new post, you are prompted for the following: Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> You have given none of this information, and you have apparently ignored an attempt to help you. </s>
<s> I'm sorry fellows,I forgot to thank my namesake Michael for the advice but I didn't do it because I knew that the problem with my peripheral wasn't physical it was a software thing I knew it, in fact I just installed some DVDs utilities and my DVD works fine with both soundtracks, please don't tell me of Alan, I forgot to include that I have Windows 2003 Server Standard Edition and so on. </s>
<s> But I'll inlcude this kind of information every other time that I need some advice or help. </s>
<s> Thank you both guys, for your time, for your advices. </s>
<s> This community rocks, computer science rocks, the Internet rocks. </s>
<s> Thx. </s>
