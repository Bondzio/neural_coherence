Something got lost in translation.
The what's are connected to what?
Let me share that the most common setup is... DSL or Cable Modem -&gt; Router (with wifi option?)
-&gt; PCs wired and wireless.
Your post wrote &quot;Internet access is thru the pc&quot; which sounds as if you have a very funky setup.
Can you tell more or just supply a quick diagram?
