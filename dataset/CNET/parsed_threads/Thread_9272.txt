<s> Hi there i have just put new ram in my HP pavilion t620a, it had 266 DDR SDRAM at 226mhz, in the second slot i put in 1gb DDR SDRAMAT 400MHZ. </s>
<s> is this ok? </s>
<s> when it boots it is fine, it recongises both ram chip when i open the setup menu, but when i got to boot the nothing happens. </s>
<s> the hp screen will show up, then it will go blank, then my screen shows no signal then it repeat the process. </s>
<s> so im thinking my harddrive is not booting? </s>

<s> Please help, i am sort of teaching myself as i go... yea might not be the best way to go... thanks </s>
<s> Is 226 a typo? </s>
<s> What is SDRAMAT? </s>
<s> DDR SDRAM at? </s>
<s> Possibly your mobo does not support DDR 400 [PC 3400]. </s>
<s> I don't know about HP setup, but possibly there is a setting to determine what speed the memory bus should run at. </s>
<s> Does your system support Dual Channel? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> According to your motherboard specs, your PC can use DDR-266/DDR-333 and maxes out at 1GB of RAM. </s>
<s> It may not work with sticks larger than 512MB. </s>

<s> (Most ddr400 is compatible with the slower speeds, but some motherboards get confused by it.) </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, return the RAM and get 1 or 2 sticks of 512MB DDR-333. </s>
