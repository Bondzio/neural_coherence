I know this can be done but have no idea how to do this or where to start. It is to complicated for a person with average computer knowledge? Thanks, Lorelee

This was easier then I thought it would be and I did not know I can also network files. Now I will see if it works when I get up in the morning!! Thanks again. Lorelee
