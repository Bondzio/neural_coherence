i too have experienced the problems you described.
today, 1/31/06 i faxed a four page letter to the ceo, mark hurd of hp requesting that they investigate the problems we are all having with the f1503 monitors.
i advised him that i am prepared and will file complaints with the state attorney general office, and the better business bureau, as well have already contacted the law firm of girard gibbs in san francisco, who had initiated an investigation into the f1703 issues prior to hp extending the warranty on those models, to open another investigation into the f1503 if they ignore my request.
i advised him that there are many of us posting here at cnet with issues on the f1503 so he cannot say that they dont know anything about it.
in the past i have found this type of action to end in positive results, but if not i will proceed with my complaints.
if i get any resolution i will advise mr. hurd that i will forward anyones name who is interested in a resolution also.
i will be back to let you all know the progress on this nd if its good we can maybe communicate so we all can get our issues resolved.
