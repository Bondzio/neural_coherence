A while ago i could connect to the internet through a few things. I used both the Opera and Firefox web browsers and occasionally internet explorer. I also have yahoo widgets that I use a weather forcast widget that gets its info from weather.com. It has been a while since my problems began, so i dont remember when, but all of a sudden firefox claimed that there was no internet connection, yet all my other options were still functional. For a while i only used opera. Then a few weeks ago I tried internet explorer and found that it too had gone the way of firefox. Well then i wanted to see if it was Opera that was doing it, so i uninstalled opera and tried both, but they didnt work. Then I reinstalled opera and found that now IT didn't work. The reason i wanted this fixed is because my creative zen mp3 player isnt working and i got a recovery tool to try, which needs the internet, but was also not finding it. At this point the only thing that seems to be able to access still is the widget for some reason...I am really stumped. I am using a wireless card, and tried swithing to LAN, but that didnt work either. I tried spyware scaning with DR.web, but after i deleted the files it found, i still don't have a connection. Any help is appreciated.
