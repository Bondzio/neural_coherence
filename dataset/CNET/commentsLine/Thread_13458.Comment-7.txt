hey, you do not need a modem to complete the installation of windows xp.
you do not need to be hooked up to the internet at all.
it will ask you and you just say later.
to be hoenst i do not think that it is the hdd xp only needs 1.5gb for the installation.
i do recommend getting a larger hdd before continuing though.
good luck
