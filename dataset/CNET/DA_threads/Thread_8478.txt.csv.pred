1.1.1	Hello all, I am looking to upgrade my current desktops processor.	St
1.1.2	The motherboard is a Pegatron M2N78-LA (Violet).	St
1.1.3	Is it worth replacing the AMD Phenom II X4 925 2.80GHz that came stock?	St
1.1.4	If so what would be a good one to replace it with.	St
1.1.5	I would like it to be decent at running cpu heavy games.	St
1.2.1	Most motherboards are designed for a certain brand and range of processors.	St
1.2.2	This is due to varying types of connections, speeds, and connections.	St
1.2.3	Obviously Intel and AMD use different sockets, but within each there're different sockets, speeds, and features.	St
1.2.4	Also a processor is designed to work with a certain type of RAM (e.g.	St
1.2.5	DDR, DDR2, DDR3), so you'd probably need new RAM to go with the processor and motherboard.	St
1.2.6	So you're looking at $200 to $300 and you still have your old hard drive, ports, power supply, operating system, and probably no warranty.	St
1.2.7	So I know I'd just spend a little more and buy a new computer.	St
1.2.8	YMMV.	St
1.3.1	What game are you asking about as most are fine with that CPU but with the best GPU you can fit.	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	you are right	Res
