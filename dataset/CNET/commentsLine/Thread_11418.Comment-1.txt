hi, having done as much research as seems possible on the internet, i'd appreciate some input to help choose between these color laser printers: - xerox phaser 6500dn - konica minolta magicolor 3730dn - hp color laserjet cp3525dn - epson aculaser c3900dn - lexmark c734dn anybody with experience of using any of them?
please post positive / negative views, especially re reliability issues and hidden / unexpected costs.
some background info currently a soho user, expanding in one years time to small business of 3+ people who will share the printer.
main use is printing duplexed a4 high quality flyers as well as teaching materials; these include (some colored) text, graphs and photographic content.
other (smaller) sizes and heavier weights of paper are occasionally printed.
i already have an oki b6200 laser printer with duplexer for plain b/w printing.
main criteria + budget of &#8364;350-&#8364;700 + text, graphic and photo printing must be as close to excellent as possible (for a laser) - slower print speeds are acceptable if not extreme - higher printing costs acceptable within reason thnx in advance for any comments on these printers, or even for other printers that you think might fit the bill.
