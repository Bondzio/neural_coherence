My budget would be around 750 euro. I will be using the computer mainly for college as I will studying IT. I do not do any gaming as well so a very good graphic card is not needed. Could anyone suggest me a good build for that money? I will be buying the parts from digitec.ch. This is what I came up with but since I do not have any idea if these parts work together well, I am a bit scared.

The other thing is... you may be getting a little too much PSU. Having 'reserve power or 'power to grow' is good but 750W seems a little much given the proposed equipment and use. A good quality 600-650W by a quality mfg like Corsair should be more than enough PSU. VAPCMD
