I just labored over this decision myself.
I had (still do) a BTO system with an MSI motherboard, 2.66 ghz processor & 1 gb RAM, ATI Radeon 9700 Pro video card...not a slouch by most people's standards but I had it built in 2000 and I'm a mega power user (database, graphics, huge files).
I checked out upgrading so I could get a 3.8 ghz processor & 2 GB of RAM (to start).
Changes in technology over the years rendered most of the parts I would have kept in compatible with the new motherboards capable of supporting the 3.8 processor... upgrade parts would have costed $1700 --- bought a new Dell Dimension XPS on sale for $2300 and kept my 2.66 in tact (networked in as a backup system).
