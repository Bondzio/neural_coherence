<s> I currently have a Celeron 2.2GHz Socket 478 running inside a Dell Dimension 2400 still with the stock Dell motherboard. </s>
<s> Currently, identification programs such as CPU-Z have listed the effective FSB as 400 with a true FSB of 100. </s>
<s> I have heard other people describe Intel FSB's as &quot;quadpumped&quot; (100x4=400). </s>
<s> Does anyone know if 400MHz is the limited effective speed for this computers motherboard because I'm curious to know if putting a Socket 478 Pentium 4 with an 800MHz would work in this computer. </s>
<s> If 400MHz is the limit, meaning the Pentium 4 with 800MHz won't work, will a Pentium M that fits into a socket 478 that runs around 1.8GHz be able to beat a Celeron at 2.2GHz (my current chip)? </s>
<s> to see if they give the part/model number of the mobo?? </s>
<s> Then go to the mobo mfr's site to see. </s>
<s> Obviously, among other things it would require faster memory. </s>
<s> Does the data you have give you the part number of the MCH chip of the chipset?? </s>
<s> Here's a link to get Intel documents. </s>
<s> Search for the chipset. </s>
