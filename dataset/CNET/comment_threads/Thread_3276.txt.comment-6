I'm with Bob on this one, you can pick up a full function notebook that isn't dramatically heavier or much more expensive than a netbook and get a better screen for watching Movies and a more capable multi-threading processor (Intel Core, rather than Atom).
Your specific questions: Will a netbook handle maximum internet sppeds?
Probably not but it will have no problem at all with your 1 Mbps.
How much multitasking can it handle?
Your list looks too heavy to me - you'd be much better off with an Intel Core processor than an Atom that sacrifices performance for lighter weight (of the whole unit) and battery life.
