I have Comcast basic cable service, and it seems to be digital. Now, is there is any way to watch digital cable TV? I'm new to it and will appreciate any support.

Even if it did, the digital channels are usually above the channels that you can get without a cable box. Our basic cable stops around channel 70-75, which are analog.
