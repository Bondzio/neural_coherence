<s> Turn off firewalls on both. </s>
<s> Make sure both have same workgroup name. </s>
<s> Share at least one folder on each PC. </s>
<s> This should make the two Pcs see each other on the network. </s>
<s> It could take up to 45 minutes for them to work. </s>
<s> Or they may have problems seeing each other anyway. </s>
<s> You can &quot;force&quot; one to see the other if needed, by using the address bar in Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> Just type the path needed. </s>
<s> If computer1 is named frontroom then type in the address bar \\frontroom\ and press ENTER. </s>
<s> If the PC is on the network and is not blocked by a firewall, shared folders will show up, even if you can't browse to them. </s>
