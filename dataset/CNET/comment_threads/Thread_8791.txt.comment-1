Hello, I just removed a very full internal hard drive (Seagate IDE) and replaced it with a new 160gb (Western Digital) hard drive.
I thought it would be a simple swap, just needing to change jumpers as I was slaving the old drive.
However, none of the drives are booting up I am getting a clicking sound from both drives.
What went wrong we simply unplugged and followed the directions that came with the new drive?
Windows XP O/S.
