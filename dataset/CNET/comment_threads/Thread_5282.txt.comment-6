I checked my settings and they had defaukted to your recommendation.
I did notice that the ip address Zone Alarm shows is slightly different than what Linksys shows.
Linksys shows XXX.XXX.X.1, but ZA shows XXX.XXX.X.0.
I cannot edit or delete the settings.
I appear to be OK, but should I do more to change the settings?
