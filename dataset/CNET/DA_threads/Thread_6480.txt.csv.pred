1.1.1	There are four PCs in the house, all running XP and all with wireless Internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the DSL modem.	St
1.1.2	The router has several RJ45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and I'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the PCs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files.	St
1.1.3	I have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc.	St
1.1.4	to specify.	St
1.1.5	Ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently.	St
1.1.6	Can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware?	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	But don't go too nuts on the size as copying files even at 100Mb tends to test patience at times.	St
1.2.2	That is, these devices called NAS are on the shelves at the usual stores.	St
1.2.3	Try one.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, Bob; that abbreviation, &quot;NAS&quot; was all I needed.	St
