1.1.1	I need a better way to backup the 4 computers in my office .	St
1.1.2	3 of them run WinXP and 1 runs Win98 ( it 's used for scanning & fax receiving ) .	St
1.1.3	They are networked peer to peer through a LinkSys 4 port router .	St
1.1.4	I currently use CD 's to backup the data only ( not the programs ) .	St
1.1.5	I am hoping for something that duplicates the hard drive so if a computer died or internal hard drive failed I could transfer the contents to a new computer or hard drive without having to reinstall all of the original software then restore data .	St
1.1.6	I am intrigued by the Maxtor One Touch II because of its simplicity and also by the fact that I can unplug it to isolate it from lightning strikes , etc .	St
1.1.7	However , it 's a little pricey to buy 4 of them , especially when I have less than 100MB of data on all 4 computers combined .	St
1.1.8	I am not a techie but I would imagine it would need a separate partition for each computer .	St
1.1.9	Am I dreaming ?	Ques
1.1.10	What would you suggest ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks in advance for any help offered .	St
1.2.1	It fails a few criteria of what & quot ; backup & quot ; should be .	St
1.2.2	Number one is a write protect .	St
1.2.3	There are many others that I 'll let you ponder .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	It 's a fast way to scoop up copies of what 's on the machines .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St

1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Good points , Bob .	St
1.3.2	I thought the One Touch II series offered some sort of write protection , but again , I 'm not well-versed in technology .	St
1.3.3	What solution would be best to meet my & quot ; wish list & quot ; as outlined in my original post ?	Ques
1.4.1	There have been attempts to do so in software or via file systems , but this does n't work like the solid switch or slide on floppies ( remember those ) or tapes .	St
1.4.2	CDR/W and DVDR/W are rendered unwritable by placing such in a DVD or CD drive that ca n't write .	St
1.4.3	This area is full of solutions but no one can agree on best .	St
1.4.4	The usual office backup is a central server to store the files that need backup , then some tape drive to cart the data off site in case of a disaster .	St
1.4.5	This all starts when the person responsible writes ... & quot ; My business 's Disaster Recovery Plan & quot ; .	St
1.4.6	The drive you spoke of will do in a pinch , but is not & quot ; backup & quot ; .	St
1.4.7	It 's a volatile copy .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
