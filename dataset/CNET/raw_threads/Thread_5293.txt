Its going to be a problem roughly in another 2-3 yrs. yet. While you can certainly still make a XP based system, the current OS is Vista which will be supplanted by Win7. Don't get too stuck on XP, because if you have upgrade later or move on beause of s/w issues, then your then current XP system may not be all that ready to do so. Regardless, as the other poster offered, visit the mtrbd. support website for availability of XP drivers and such as this is a telling sign of support now and hopefully later. tada -----Willy
