<s> I just got a brand new 24&quot; Dell Monitor that has both a HDMI and DVI-D port, as does my video card for my PC. </s>
<s> Question - which is better to use, or does it matter. </s>
<s> As a side note I do know HDMI carries both Audio and Video, while the DVI-D does not carry audio, but that is not an issue for me. </s>
<s> I have the sound taken care of through my sound card and a seperate external speaker config. </s>
<s> So I am asking strictly for the graphic part of it. </s>
<s> does one work better? </s>
<s> Or is it both digital signals and thus pretty much the same? </s>
<s> Finally, I assume either will give a better picture than if I use the VGA connection (which I also have) - correct? </s>
<s> oops - I meant vga in original title (sorry for the type) </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I thought as much, but thanks for the clairification. </s>
<s> much appreciated. </s>
<s> I would of hated to use one connection if the other was a better choice. </s>
<s> The HDMI and DVI interfaces are logically identical, there is no difference in image quality whatsoever. </s>
<s> Forget VGA, it has zero to offer you unless you ever need to use an old monitor for some reason. </s>
<s> Naturally you should always set the video adapter resolution in Windows to match the LCD monitor's native resolution, any other setting causes a noticeable losss of image quality. </s>
