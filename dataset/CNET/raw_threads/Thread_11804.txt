But taken wholesale it fails the forum policy outright. Next is that we do see a form of spam that is not tolerated. That is, top posting with a link that is to some other site in an attempt to build links or traffic to such sites. You can avoid all this by writing your post and avoiding all the issues that trip the wire. Bob
