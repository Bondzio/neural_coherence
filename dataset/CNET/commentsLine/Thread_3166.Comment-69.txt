their is very little to do.
just make sure that you do not disconnect improperly.
also i purchase two seagate external and they fail losing all info within one month.
received a replacement by seagate only to have same problem over and over again.
seagate refuse to say that they have problems, except that they keep replacing them with used drives.
has anybody else had problem with seagate external drives.
i have a lace for more than two years never had a problem.
