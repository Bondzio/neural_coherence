1.2.1	Standard wireless equipment might be able to go 50 meters through unobstructed outdoor space.	St
1.2.2	10 meters if there are obstructions, such as trees.	St
1.2.3	A kilometer is feasible only under very good conditions and with specialized adaptations of the equipment by an experienced technician.	St
1.2.4	Sorry.	St
