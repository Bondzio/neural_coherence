<s> My girlfriends dell laptop recently got a bad virus. </s>
<s> I reinstalled windows xp to get rid of this virus. </s>
<s> Everything with the reboot went ok. </s>
<s> I noticed that when scrolling through internet pages it was very sluggish. </s>
<s> I did some research and found that I didn't re-install the graphics card driver after the reboot. </s>
<s> Unfortunitley my girlfriend didn't have the driver disk for the graphics card. </s>
<s> I instead tried to manually install it from the list and accidently installed the wrong one. </s>
<s> Now, when you turn on the computer you can see the screen that says &quot;Dell&quot; and then the Screen that says &quot; Microsoft windows with the progress bar&quot; once this is done loading the screen goes black. </s>
<s> You can still here everything booting up but no picture. </s>
<s> How can I remove the bad driver without being able to see anything? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks Andy </s>
<s> If you really had a bad virus, it would be wize to start by completely reformatting your hard drive. </s>
<s> Many times those things sit deeply in the registry. </s>
<s> That will also solve your wrong driver too. </s>
