i'm with bob on this one, you can pick up a full function notebook that isn't dramatically heavier or much more expensive than a netbook and get a better screen for watching movies and a more capable multi-threading processor (intel core, rather than atom).
your specific questions: will a netbook handle maximum internet sppeds?
probably not but it will have no problem at all with your 1 mbps.
how much multitasking can it handle?
your list looks too heavy to me - you'd be much better off with an intel core processor than an atom that sacrifices performance for lighter weight (of the whole unit) and battery life.
