The monitor has no communication with computer as soon as the computer is turned on. But I can hear computer running(i.e cpu fans working, hard disk running). Everythings looks normal but I can see nothing on the monitor. Please help! if more info, let me know. OS is XP Thanks

You lose the prior work and we get to duplicate all the same ground. I refuse to do that. In short, follow the prior steps to reduce the machine to CPU, motherboard and such to get it to beep. No beeps? Then you are looking at the pile of possible bad parts. Bob
