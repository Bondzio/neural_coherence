I was wondering if I am doing something wrong.
I am connecting my Cyber Home CH-DVD 300 via component video out, into a monitor with a vga only input.
The cable I am using is The HDTV RGB/15 pin to 3 rca Component video cable.
There also is a Male vga to 2 female vga &quot;splitter&quot; that is connected to the monitor.
i am running audio out rca and i can hear the program just fine, i just can't see it.
My computer is connected to the other side of the splitter and it works just fine, however when i have both the computer connected and turned on, and the dvd player there seems to be a signal interruption, which is leading me to believe I can make this work.
The other part of this equation is that on the vga side of the component cable, there is a pin in the middle that is missing.
I hope someone can help me.
Thanks!
