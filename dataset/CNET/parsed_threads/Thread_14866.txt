<s> howdy, The hard drive on my HP Pavilion zv5120us failed and I need to get a new one. </s>
<s> Can I just go and get any 2.5&quot; IDE drive or do I need a specific one that HP reccomends? </s>
<s> I can't find a whole lot of information on HP's support site, it's so fantastic! </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> ...the same. </s>
<s> Same IDE / Power plug etc., but check your BIOS and Manual first to make sure it has an &quot;Auto-Detect&quot; hard drive option. </s>
<s> If it can &quot;Auto-detect&quot;, it'll almost certainly be able to use any laptop drive, as these are standard across all makes and models. </s>
<s> Seagate's Momentus (one with Perpendicular Storage) would be a good upgrade. </s>
<s> These offer better speeds, quicker accesses, lower votage use, and produce less heat than usual (but cost more!). </s>
<s> It might inject a bit of extra life into your Laptop. </s>

<s> does the same apply for Apple laptops? </s>
<s> i may end up purchasinng a MacBook, but if I want to upgrade that hard drive, the same applies correct? </s>
<s> any IDE drive will work? </s>
<s> ...applies to Apple laptop Hard Drive upgrades / replacement. </s>
<s> They use the same 2.5&quot; IDE Hard Drive interface. </s>
