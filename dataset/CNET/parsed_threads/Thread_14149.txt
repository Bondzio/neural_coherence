<s> Recently my 1-year old pc suddenly unable to detect the master SATA Hard Disk Drive. </s>
<s> So I have no choice but to revert to my old IDE HDD, and meanwhile I purchased another SATA HDD as a back-up to this IDE HDD. </s>
<s> But upon installing this brand new SATA HDD, again my pc BIOS cannot detect it. </s>
<s> It looks like the problem all the while is concerning the SATA function of my Motherboard rather than the SATA HDD itself. </s>
<s> What went wrong? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is the BIOS current? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Why are the details not in your post? </s>
<s> Hint: make/model/version/revision/pictures/stories, etc. </s>

<s> My apologies, here are my system specs: Operating system: Windows XP Professional sp2 Motherboard: MSI 865PE Neo2-P (2004) BIOS (as per original, not updated) Hard disk: Seagate Barracuda 80G SATA (2004) Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 80G SATA (2005) Quantum Fireball 20G IDE (2002) I am now running on the IDE HDD because basically it is the only drive detectable by my pc. </s>
<s> &quot;BIOS (as per original, not updated)&quot; I know to update it as I get hardware to sidestep issues like these. </s>
<s> There is another possible issue here, but I can't tell in your posts. </s>
<s> You may have tried to install XP onto a SATA drive without supplying drivers along the way. </s>
<s> This rarely works. </s>
<s> The motherboard manual should detail what's needed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I did not want to temper with the BIOS as long as the pc can operate, this was fine over a year until recently the SATA HDD was suddenly undetectable. </s>
<s> I guess I'm wrong. </s>
<s> Should/must I update the BIOS? </s>
<s> I was forced to re-install XP on an older IDE HDD and it is working. </s>
<s> But a newly purchsed SATA HDD cannot be detected, so I suspect the motherboard's SATA function is damaged. </s>
<s> It's a lesson I learned a long time ago. </s>
<s> You can goto the motherboard maker's web page and read what was fixed. </s>

<s> IEEE, Bob recommended a good start. </s>
<s> No manufacturer will want to talk to you unless you have up-to-date bios. </s>
<s> However, since this failure occurred on two seperate new drives, I suspect you have a motherboard failure. </s>
<s> The motherboard should also have more than one SATA port on it. </s>
<s> Try moving the cables to a different port (plugs on the board itself) and try that. </s>
<s> Hopefully you only have a partail failure of your motherboard's SATA controllers. </s>
<s> Let us know OK? </s>

<s> In my case - a stock HP Media PC M7248N with a MSI MS-7184 AmethystM Micro ATX motherboard. </s>
<s> The power in the house went down, so the box took a hard powerhit. </s>
<s> After the power came back, the same old SATA root drive that came with the box was undetectable. </s>
<s> Looking at it on another box - the disk is fine - that leaves the motherboard. </s>
<s> Same situation... Stock BIOS, No hardware changes - no intervening MSFT updates..... box was working - box takes powerhit - box not working. </s>
<s> I conclude BIOS has nothing to do with it. </s>
<s> I was never totally thrilled with this PC. </s>
<s> When I first got the box, minor physical shock would cause the system to hang. </s>
<s> I reseated all the memory chips and the problem went away. </s>
<s> Maybe I'll try punching in the disk parameters manually, but BIOS just doesn't see it. </s>
