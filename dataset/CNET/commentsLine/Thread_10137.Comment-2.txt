what model router?
try downloading the latest firmware.
it sounds like your router software sucks.
dial on demand is pretty self explanatory.
any packet destined for the internet constitutes &quot;demand&quot;.
there should also be some &quot;idle timer&quot; settings that are used to disconnect the router after some time of no traffic.
setting these to 0 usually means never hang-up.
some isps automatically disconnect you after many hours to prevent you from setting up a mail or ftp server.
you might try rebooting the router before a really long gaming session to get a fresh login and restart the isps timer, if you think it is your isp screwing with you.
check you ip address on the router once a day and see if it is changing.
