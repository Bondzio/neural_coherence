<s> I presently have a normal home network using cables. </s>
<s> My most modern desktop is attached to the internet via a local Dial-up connection. </s>
<s> I have another desktop and a laptop hooked up the the dial up through a Windows XP network. </s>
<s> I am interested in going wireless with my home network and not yet going DSL or Cable with the internet. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> I think I just need to replace my 10/100 network cards with wireless and I can run the network the same way through Win XP. </s>
<s> Also, would I be able to use my laptop to hookup through hot spots? </s>
<s> If you have ICS up and working proper, and you have a LAN, then all I would need to do is plug in something like a WAP11. </s>
<s> There are MANY models like this, so here's a link to give you a starting point -&gt; http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=22&prid=429 Then for the clients, you put client WiFi cards in... Bob </s>
<s> Couldn't I just replace my NIC cards with wireless Network cards? </s>
<s> Then and I can run the network the exact same way as I do now through Win XP Network with Microsoft ICS. </s>
<s> I don't have any wireless cards now, so the WAP11 would not be of any use. </s>
<s> I am new so if this is a stupid question, please dumb down your answer. </s>
<s> Thank You, Dennis </s>
<s> The WAP11 is the WiFi access point. </s>
<s> Once you have ICS working on your LAN, you simply plug that into your LAN. </s>
<s> The clients get WiFi cards and communicate to the WAP. </s>
<s> No changes to your ICS or LAN would be required. </s>
<s> Just plug in the WAP, follow it's included instructions and then add WiFi clients. </s>
<s> Since ADHOC mode will be very cumbersome, I'll excuse myself from that lengthy discussion. </s>

<s> Before you buy a bunch of wireless network cards you better test it out, wireless is a real disappointment to many people, it just doesn't work that well, and many places can't get wireless working over a whole house, much less to the next room down the hall, you never know how it will work until you try. </s>
<s> I have had to wire a few places that expected to be able to go wireless, and could not. </s>
