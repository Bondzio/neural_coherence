Gotta be careful about removing duplicate entries as some apps require their own dedicated dll's, etc.
Learned about that the hard way when using an app designed to remove such which was touted as &quot;totally safe&quot;.
Perhaps I'm just paranoid but since then when I suspect something is a duplicate I usually just leave it be, and in any case I don't use software for the job.
