<s> I have the MT1316B BDV212B VER 0.36 ... </s>
<s> I can only find firmware updates for ver 0.40, 0.42, and 0.43. </s>
<s> And the flash software all requires that i make a bootable diskette in order to install it. </s>
<s> Several months ago my 3rd diskette drive decided to stop working, and I dont have any other computers to steal one out of. </s>
