i don't buy the idea that dust bunnies (or even the cat hair that's everywhere else in my office) can get inside my intel imac.
all the vents are on the bottom, which is several inches above the desktop.
does my computer suck it in like plankton?
or is this just another reason to be glad i don't have a pc?
