Not really that good with some hardware. So far we have a Canon 712 cartridge but no idea what to use before we break the seal on the box

Locate the decal/sticker that denotes your model# and then visit the Canon support website and locate that info. Many refill ink vendors offer &quot;replacements(refills) or new OEM&quot; ink carts as well. That info is on the ink cart itself or packaging. There should be no mystery in finding those details to proceed forth. tada -----Willy
