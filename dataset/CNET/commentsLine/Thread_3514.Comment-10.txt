the slot 1 transistion to socket 370 ended with some piiis running at 600mh.
there were 2 mounting hardware configurations, as i recall.
i had one asus board i remember converting to accept the piii module.
after 600mh it was socket 370. so, you might find an old 600mh slot 1 module out there.
if it's cheap enough, it might be worth a try.
