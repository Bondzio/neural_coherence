My home network utilizes a Verizon Actiontec MI424-WR router - 100 mbps. I have a DLink DNS-321 for Network storage. And I'd like to have at least one computer (hardwired) in my network connect at 1000 mbps. My question is this... If I buy a 1000 mbps Switch, add it to the network and connect it to DNS-321 and the NIC of my workstation, can I access the DNS-321 at 1000 mbps? In other words, will my data flow thru the switch directly between the two devices without having to go thru the (slower) router? Thanks, ...Jerry
