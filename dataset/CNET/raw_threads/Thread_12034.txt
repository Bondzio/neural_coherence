Thanks..

Usually, however, your router and modem will operate independently. If you get a new modem, it just needs to recognize the router so you can't change them without powering them on in the proper sequence. See the forum sticky for that sort of information.

I don't assume you configured the router for the old modem, so there shouldn't be a need to configure it now. Anyway, just try. That's the fastest and surest way to know. And come back if it doesn't work. Kees
