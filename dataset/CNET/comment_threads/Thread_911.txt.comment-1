Macbook OSX Maxtor External HD 250 GB I recently switched over to macs from an hp pc computer.
i have a maxtor external hd that went along with the pc and i saved all of my music/videos/movies on the hd so that i could bring them into my new laptop.
i've installed the cd that came with the hd and while i can delete/copy/bring files into my computer, i cannot add or bring anything into the hd from my mac.
i've scoured over google/this forum/the world for an answer and i have yet to come across one.
PLEASE HELP!!
!
