11641	0	246370	2479204	NR	KeithA39	5/5/07 10:07 PM	1.17840282E12	My monitor won't automatically come on after &quot;stand by&quot;	Amateur here and any help would be appreciated. I have a Gateway computer (about a year and a half old) running XP with a LCD flat screen monitor. All was well until today when, after the computer had been on &quot;stand by&quot; mode, the monitor failed to automatically come on when I started the computer up again. I turned off the power button to the monitor, then turned it back on again and received the message, &quot;no signal&quot;. After checking to see if the connections were all secure, I restarted the computer (not just &quot;stand by&quot;) and the monitor came on as normal. I tried &quot;stand by&quot; again with the same &quot;no signal&quot; results. I'm at a loss. Don't know if this means I need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly. Any help would be appreciated.
