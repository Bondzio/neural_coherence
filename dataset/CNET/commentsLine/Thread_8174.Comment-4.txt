i do some gaming.
i guess i would like to do a raid 0 configuration to speed up my gaming.
my understanding is that i do not need a second operating system installed to do this.
i guess then, my questions are narrowed down to these: am i going to have a problem running raid 0 configuration with a 80+ gb sized sata hardrive and a 60gb ide hardrive?
if not, does anyone have any recommendations for a hardrive?
lastly, what steps will i need to utilize in order to implement this process?
thanks,
