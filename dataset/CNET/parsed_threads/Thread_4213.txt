<s> OK, here goes: I have a Vista desktop, and two XP laptops. </s>
<s> Desktop is wired to the router. </s>
<s> Laptops are wireless. </s>
<s> Printer is connected to the network via Ethernet cable to the ROUTER. </s>
<s> The desktop can see the printer. </s>
<s> It can also see the two laptops on the network. </s>
<s> Neither laptop can see nor print to the printer. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> See if you can ping that address from a laptop. </s>
<s> I'm presuming you've already tried to load printer drivers for the laptops and point them to that printer by IP address. </s>
<s> I can ping the printer from the one laptop I can get to this morning, and from the desktop. </s>
<s> The other laptop used to be able to print to this printer, the one beside me is a new addition to the house, have not run the printer disc on it as it's a netbook. </s>
<s> Looking for the disc now. </s>
<s> You say to &quot;point them to that printer by IP address&quot; I'm not sure what you mean, could you explain please? </s>
<s> (I'm sort of idiot savant, I get &quot;ping&quot; but not how to point a driver, ok, more like just idiot lol) </s>
<s> it will want to print to a port. </s>
<s> The default is usually LPT1. </s>
<s> You should get a message asking if it's a local or network printer. </s>
<s> You select network printer and follow the instructions to browse to a shared printer or create a port. </s>
<s> You will be creating a TCP/IP port that &quot;points&quot; to the printer. </s>
<s> It will be the printer's wireless IP address. </s>
<s> Hope that explains better. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> None of the original computers on the network had ever needed the driver install before today (using built in drivers, I guess) I did the driver install on the netbook, and pow! </s>
<s> there was the printer. </s>
<s> Repeated the process on the other XP machine and likewise. </s>
<s> Now we can print from any of the computers, regardless of the OS or location! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
