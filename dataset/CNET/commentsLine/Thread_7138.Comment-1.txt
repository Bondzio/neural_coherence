for college dorm.
i have a canon pixma 1700 but it appears that this prints text as composite color, i can't seem to see where it will just print black from black cartridge..?
i really hate it when printer manufacturers make it so you have to buy a new color cartridge because one color runs out -- when you are basically only printing text.
are there any hp printers that work well and use black cartridge for text, that are under $100?
or any other suggestions?
thanks
