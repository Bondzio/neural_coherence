2897	4	254105	2526927	2525687	mil	6/28/07 12:20 PM	1.1830332E12	Dropped connections	Sorry folks...as I have noted in the past I know very,, very little about the technical aspects of computering. What information do I need to provide in order to elicit some educated guesses?????? __ Today (Thursday) I also had dropped connections; inability to get on the internet at times (page cannot be displayed is tiring to see) and emails not going through or being received (&quot;server interrupted&quot;). THe internet provider says the telephone line connection looks fine but...who knows???? I'll try to provide whatever information is requested......... I have Microsoft XP Professional operating system.. but I don't know what else to add. Thank you to everyone who has given me suggestions during past &quot;crises&quot; Mill

You can't share make and models of all the network components then you may have to call in professional on site help. Here we work with you on your issue but given no details I have to say it's time to call in the hired help. Bob

If you are using a wired set up i would say you might just need to check the cable.

I keep a virus program running, even changing programs from time to time. I ever did a full system restore going back 6 months, a point that I knew I had no problems. I finally gave up and took it to the shop. It ended up that I had multiple viruses despite always keeping a virus scan going. I didn't believe the technician when he told me that, but when I re-attached everything, the computer has been running faster and I've had no disconnects since. My problem now is that I don't know what virus program to use, because I don't know which one I can believe. For me, the $49 visit to the shop was well worth not losing my mind!

Sometimes spyware embeds itself in your Winsock files (which controls how windows accesses network services). Usually, removing this spyware can damage your Winsock files as they are sometimes attached to each other (so the spyware removal program will remove the Winsock file that the spyware is attached to, not just the spyware alone), causing internet connection difficulties. But that is just one of many possible scenarios.
