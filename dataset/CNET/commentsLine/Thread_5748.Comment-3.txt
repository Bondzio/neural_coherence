what a bummer, mr. moderator.
so what's the answer?
vacationing last week in hawaii, there were &quot;hot spots&quot; in most of the local coffee houses that would give you a password for about $10 per day.
being the cheapskates that we are, we opted for dial-up access (56k), which felt like reverting back to the 50's because it was so slow.
but i've heard of &quot;access&quot; thru your cellular phone, also &quot;satellite&quot; service (for the mobile computer-guy).
what's the story?
are there any holy grails out there that are functional?
