A) scrap the hard drives B) consider 6800 series SLI (6800GT or Ultra, GT SLI was about the same cost as a single 7800GTX) I say scrap the hard drives on the basis that while they may seem better, your going to se about a .5% performance boost vs a standard 7200 RPM SATA drive, their just for show/&quot;bling&quot; they serve no real benefit and they cost A LOT i'd suggest dual 250GB drives with no RAID array, or if you really want, a RAID 1 array with dual 250GB drives (as it provides backup) i'd personally avoid RAID 0 given that it halves the drives' reliability (if one in 1000 dies, using RAID 0 your death rate is 1 in 500, and so forth, if your using 4 drives in RAID 0 your death rate is now 1 in 250, because if one drive fails the entire array is runied (data, not physically, unless it blows up and takes everything with it) i'd suggest maybe even just a single 250-300GB drive and as far as a CPU the 3200+ is fine for overclocking like your talking about you will need to know what your doing, and i'd suggest the Venice 3000+, as it's cheaper and has been shown to provide overclocks just as well as the 3200+ i'd have to agree with nerdyboy, except not in his grammar structure, but personally i'm entirely against Crucial for performan RAM I would suggest considering some of the following companies: OCZ Corsair's XMS Line Mushkin Enhanced Memory Technologies in addition to G.SKILL and in some cases Kingston can provide a decent product (G.SKILL is excellent, Kingston is hit or miss, same goes for GeIL) another good brand is Patriot i'd suggest OCZ's Enhanced Latency Platinum Revision 2 which is shown by some reviews (such as those done at anandtech) to be capable of over DDR 550 which is rather impressive not that Athlon64 overclocking requires the RAM to be raised alongside the FSB such as Pentium 4 or K7 overclocking does (as the Athlon64 doesn't use a front side bus, at least not like Pentium 4 or K7) The power supply choice is decent, i'd suggest ensuring your case has good ventilation (i know what the LanBoy is, but I can't be bothered to look it at the moment) by good ventilation I mean multiple fans at various locations of the case I would also suggest considering waiting on the 7800GTX for about a month, ATi is preparing to launch their new product, the R520, in August-September (not that I would personally buy ATi, but if it offered a considerably larger performance increase at a simmilar price point it would be considered) well, that's just my 2 cents you can give me all the [H] links you want to comments on that RAM, but i've learned throughout time to never trust any forum member's good OC's to mean a given product will be good (if it's not intended as a high performancep art, such as TwinMOS UTT which everyone said was cheap value RAM, which it was, yet everyone claimed it could handle amazing overclocks, well, a lot of people have had bad luck with it recently) i'm not saying their wrong, i'm saying usually a value product doesn't stay high performance moddable such as the nF4 Ultra to SLI mod only 10,000 chips were produced that could be modified at that point nVidia realized that they needed to fix something
