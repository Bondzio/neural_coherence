Over the years I've used a variety of brands of off-system storage, including the Cruiser 1Gb which worked flawlessly except for the need for a clean reformat at time of purchase (can be said of most of them -- work best/most reliably if they are wiped occassionally).
Things to consider/watch for: - If you have a Mac anywhere in your workflow (home/office/local print-house/etc), make sure the drive is cross-platform compatible.
The Cruiser is, although file names get truncated.
- Consider whether you would be better served by a dual-purpose machine, such as an iPod (which can be used for storage as well for any model except the shuffle, while still providing MP3/AIFF/AC3/etc playback capabilites with the rest of the dedicated memory), or a cell-phone that takes mini-CF cards and an USB dataport, or even a digital camera with a large memory card.
I have used all of these methods at various times to move data, and one of my HD-based iPods commonly serves as a field-boot drive for client macs in addition to just being an ''iPod''.
- Finally, consider how long you want the data, how much you'll need in a year or two, and whether a micro external HD (eSATA, USB-2, FireWire/IEEE-1394) makes sense for you.
If you just need to move the occasional document, it may not, but if you move entire projects or need active back-up of your stuff, it may make better sense...
