1.sygate personal firewall 5.6 2.ad-aware 6.0 professional 3.spyware blaster 4.spybot s&d i have another comp upstairs with almost the exact same configuration.
the only difference is it's running amd.
down here im running pentium 4 and im getting that error message when i try to disable the wireless adapter.
upstairs i have the exact same adapter, d-link dwl-520 and it disables fine...i don't see how any running programs could affect something like this.
but hey, mabye you know something i don't.
my best guess is that its a corrupted .dll of some sort.
looking foreward to your response.
