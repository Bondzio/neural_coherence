1.1.1	My mouse keeps freezing up.	St
1.1.2	I am running XP Pro.	St
1.1.3	I thought it might be my cordless mouse but I put on the old mouse and it still does the same thing.	St
1.1.4	I have to shut my computer down to get it to work.	St
1.1.5	It will work for awhile then it does it again.	St
1.1.6	If this is not the right forums to ask this question, please direct me to the proper one.	St
1.1.7	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	You'd have to provide more information.	St
1.2.2	Mouse freeze is a type of system freeze, and often, a complete lockup follows right afterwards.	St
1.2.3	Could be caused by anything...	St
1.3.1	The mouse will not move but my keyboard will still work.	St
1.3.2	Since I am not very good at using the keyboard to access things I just turn the computer off.	St
1.3.3	I thought I might have an virus so I ran norton and plus I ran spy doctor to check and see if anything would be there too.	St
1.4.1	I think you may have a virus/spyware, as you suggested.	St
1.4.2	Try looking at your process list to see if you have any unnecessary processes running.	St
1.4.3	If you press-and-hold ctrl, then shift, then delete, the task manager will open.	St
1.4.4	Next, click the &quot;processes&quot; tab, and click on the &quot;name&quot; button.	St
1.4.5	This will alphabatize them, which sometimes helps.	St
1.4.6	Go to... http://www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm ... this site for help on what processes are needed and what ones are not.	St
1.4.7	Once you have closed several processes that are unneeded, your computer will probably speed up some.	St
1.4.8	Also, it might be good if you go into the options menu, select &quot;hide when minimized,&quot; and then minimize it.	St
1.4.9	The little performance icon will sit in your tray, and you can monitor when your computer gets slower, because you will see more green bars lit.	St
1.4.10	If your mouse freezes up, and the box is completely green, you know that it is freezing up because of your computer being slow.	St
1.4.11	Hope this helps... hasta luego!	St
