<s> I am looking for an old Gateway 2000 desktop computer, preferrably with Windows 98. </s>
<s> MUST have a Telepath II (14,400) modem and the Faxworks program that came with the computer. </s>
<s> Doesn't have to look great; just run so I can replay some old sentimental voicemails of a deceased family member. </s>
<s> For what it's worth, the one I had was a Pentium 75 with about 64mbs of RAM and a 720 mb hard drive. </s>
<s> Doesn't have to match those numbers necessarily. </s>
<s> Any suggestions?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I need to wonder why you need a computer to play old voicemail messages. </s>
<s> If you have them stored on some media, it would seem there could be other options. </s>
<s> Well, I would've thought so too since they are simple voice recordings, but so far I cannot find anything to play or convert the files That is my end goal; to convert the files to MP3 so they can copied onto a CD &amp; played in any CD player. </s>
<s> I have limited knowledge of such things but done a fair amount of research and can't seem to find another solution. </s>
<s> At this point, it seems easiest to try &amp; go back to the original setup with Windows 98 and Faxworks. </s>
<s> I have the files on CD (along with an installed version of Faxworks) and also on my hard drive. </s>
<s> Each .VMF file has a sister .CTL file. </s>
<s> Two files with the same name, just different file extensions. </s>
<s> Thanks for your interest! </s>
<s> and were answered by one of the most knowledgeable people here. </s>
<s> His advice was to do as you are asking here. </s>
<s> About all I can find is a suggestion that something called &quot;Iwave Media Player&quot; can handle that format. </s>
<s> It also seems that the extension isn't unique to the voice mail program mentioned. </s>
<s> I've found plenty of hits using google to search for converter programs for that format but none seem like solid leads. </s>
<s> My guess is that you may have already explored many of these sites already. </s>
<s> I don't think I can offer much help here but thought knowing the file format might be useful. </s>
<s> Good luck in your efforts anyway. </s>
<s> Do you have any leads on this Iwave Media Player? </s>
<s> I think tried searching for that too, to no avail. </s>
<s> It seems like a lot of hits on Google lead to nonexistant websites or have changed since the introduction of the inet wave player. </s>
<s> However, someone, somewhere should have an archive of such things I would think they we we use data storage and archives. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your interest. </s>
<s> If you come accross anything that will help, please keep me in mind. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I think it was suggested to try a Google's virtual machine ( or virtual box??) </s>
<s> or something to that effect. </s>
<s> Is this something you'd agree could work? </s>
<s> I just bought a computer from a gentleman that lied to me.... he said it was 8 years old but it is older..and a 2000 because i found stuff on it that was from 2000..... not 2004. </s>
<s> Would you be interested? </s>
<s> it is a dial up computer..remember those? </s>
<s> My email is gingoss@comcast.net Please let me know/....... </s>
<s> I may be interested if it has the right hardware/software. </s>
<s> Can you be more specific about the computer. </s>
<s> Does it have the Faxworks program and/or a Telepath II mo Piersondem. </s>
<s> Please give me as much detail as possible including the price. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Ron Pierson </s>

<s> Are you all set? </s>
