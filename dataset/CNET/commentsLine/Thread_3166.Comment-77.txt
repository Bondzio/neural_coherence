i've had 3 different external hard drives, each by a different manufacturer.
some were bought based on ratings by places like cnet.
none lasted much over a year.
i only used them to backup files once a day.
i got so tired of them crapping out that i switched to online storage.
but when i had to do a restore, it took 2.5 days to restore 12 gb.
so i've bought another external hard drive, deciding that online storage is not appropriate for primary backup.
will keep the online backup as secondary.
