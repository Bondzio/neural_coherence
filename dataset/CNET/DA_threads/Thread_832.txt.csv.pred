1.1.1	i have 2 computers 1 of which cannot connect over wireless for some reason which i have given up on, so im trying to bridge my wireless computer to my bad computer using a cord.	St
1.1.2	I bridged it fine... i think xD it says its all connected but the other computer still doesnt get internet, and when i try to repair i get an error on both the computers that says something about conflicting ip adresses... i read another post about this but it completely threw me(im not exactly the best when it comes to computers :P).	St
1.1.3	i tried ipconfig to check if they were same ip but one of the computers just gave me a bunch of gibberish in the ip section(EX: fe80::2e0:18ff and so on....).	St
1.1.4	think anyone could explain simply how i can fix this(if you need any info about 1 of my computers i prolly wont know it but ill try my best to tell you lol).	Ques
1.2.1	I might have tried to use ICS to do this.	St
1.2.2	Here's some fodder for you to work with.	St
1.2.3	Note; Since ICS is finicky and you must get it right I won't offer much support for it.	St
1.2.4	You can swap the internet to the WIFI connections for ICS so here's the article.	St
