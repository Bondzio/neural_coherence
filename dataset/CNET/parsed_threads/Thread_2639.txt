<s> i've been going bonkers trying to find a program that would allow me to transfer my 9mm tapes on my camcorder, and record them on to my harddrive. </s>
<s> i'm using a sony vaio and it has the composite cables. </s>
<s> i used to use the program that came iwth the computer called Giga Pocket, but recently the computer completely crashed and i had to reformat using a windows xp disk. </s>
<s> so here i am, unable to find giga pocket or any program that can also be used in the same manner. </s>
<s> any help or suggestions from another fellow human being will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/223993 notes where to download the driver. </s>
<s> But if you didn't use the restore CDs you may have to start over with the right CDs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i don' have any cds, which is why i'm stuck. </s>
<s> i've came across the drivers and they don't do anything unless i have the program installed. </s>
<s> giga pocket is a dead end, unless i find a torrent which i can't find. </s>
<s> i just need an alternative program that can do the same thing giga pocket does, which is have the program record from the AV/Component cables in my video card onto the desktop. </s>
<s> Try this one. </s>
<s> I only has one seed so I don't know if it will work -good luck. </s>

<s> hah, I've tried this, it got up to 4 percent and then all the peers dropped to 0 and now nothing connects </s>
<s> I'll try downloading it for you. </s>
<s> It's at 11% right now downloading at 50Kbp/s. </s>
<s> you are downloading from a seeder? </s>
<s> There are an even number of seeds and peers (4) I am currently at 48%. </s>
<s> you know...i opened up the torrent again...and i'm connected to one peer which has 61.7% completed which is probably you. </s>
<s> i'm at 44.7 percent. </s>
<s> i wonder why that is...i hope it doesn't stop or turn blue </s>
<s> That's me since I'm at 63% now. </s>
<s> I'll keeping seeding until you get it. </s>
<s> i don't like saying thank you because i think humans should just always do nice things for other humans. </s>
<s> majority of us don't, but you are one of the few that actually does exist. </s>
<s> i think. </s>
<s> but thanks a **** load, i've been working on this for the past 7 hours </s>
<s> you have no idea how happy you've made me. </s>
<s> i was just starting to resort to alcohol to calm myself down. </s>
<s> take care </s>
<s> Nothing makes me happier then when I'm helping someone else. </s>
<s> I hope you got all of it, my client stopped seeding. </s>
<s> Take care mate. </s>
<s> Sony is your primary support, why not contact them for proper CD replacements(some cost), etc.. </s>
<s> Using Torrent if possible and could end in yet another issue. </s>
<s> No matter how you finally get your system up and running at 100%, be sure to backup and/or create recovery CDs for an easier recovery next time. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
