<s> one purchase an ISA or PCI card to run an internal floppy?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> But the sad truth is that I don't see such a card. </s>
<s> The issue here is that a motherboard could cost about the same. </s>
<s> What motherboard is this? </s>
<s> What CPU and such parts do you need to move over? </s>

<s> Ray, check this out. </s>
<s> Looks as it is for an ISA slot. </s>

<s> Ray: Try some WD-40 on the micro switches just inside the flip door. </s>
<s> the one on the right looking in is the write protect, and the one on the left is the media sensor switch. </s>
<s> What i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy, particularly, the media sensor. </s>
<s> If this stays down in a stuck position, the drive thinks it has a 720 disk, but your command has told it that it was a 1.44, therefore you may get a message &quot;cannot read, disk not formatted etc.&quot; A little WD-40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches, and often puts the drive back in service. </s>
<s> Its worth a try, I fixed one this past weekend for a friend. </s>

<s> Also check the mother board floppy plug slot to see if a pin is bent down against another pin, sometimes these slots are not indexed (missing a pin) and some one uses a indexed cable (blank space on the cable connector) bending the pin down while forcing the cable in the slot. </s>

<s> This idiot was building a new computer and setting up the old one for another user. </s>
<s> The old one was using an LS120 [IDE] drive as the floppy. </s>
<s> This was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with Quickbooks on it. </s>
<s> Used it to back up Quickbooks. </s>
<s> Now two years ago, this same idiot disabled the Floppy controller because at that time the system didn't have a floppy drive. </s>
<s> Guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Now I have an ISA controller that can handle a bunch of floppies. </s>
<s> Anyone need it? </s>
