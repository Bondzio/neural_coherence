Well, i just updated the motherboard drivers, still no change.
Here's all my information that i DO have.
(Sorry that i didn't include it before) Operating System: Windows XP: Home Edition RAM: 2542 MB Processor: Intel(R)Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz (w CPUs) System Model: D65GBH (it's a custom computer put together at the store) Also just discovered it can't detect the sound card either.
or the ethernet controller so it's most definitely a driver problem
