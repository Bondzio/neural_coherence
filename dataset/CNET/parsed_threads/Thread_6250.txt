<s> Whilst reinstalling my Tevion DVB-T 100 Digital TV program after a system reinstal, I got following message:- &quot;Access violation at address 004FDE72 in module &quot;DVTR.exe&quot;. </s>
<s> Read of address 00000000&quot; Can anyone please help? </s>
<s> After trying to instal about six times, I contacted the Manufacturer's help line but they can't help. </s>
<s> I have used this before without any problems. </s>
<s> I use XP Professional (SP3) </s>
<s> I take it that no-one is familiar with this type of fault. </s>
<s> Is that error reference something that could be fixed in the registry? </s>
<s> Only the author of the application may be able to tell you why it did that. </s>
<s> Can you go back to when it worked? </s>
