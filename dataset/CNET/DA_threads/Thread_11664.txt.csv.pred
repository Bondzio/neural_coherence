1.1.1	I recently acquired an old PowerSpec PC (model 7670) that I want to use as a simple home file server.	St
1.1.2	I want to stick a couple of 400 GB SATA harddrives and a RAID controller card in, and I also think I'll need to upgrade the 150W power supply (I've removed the floppy & extra CD-ROM drives).	St
1.1.3	This is the one that's in the system now: http://www.mecbatec.com/Documents/FP150N80.pdf I'm thinking I just need a 300-400W power supply (plus either no fan or silent running fan) but I'm not quite sure what to look for.	St
1.1.4	All products on newegg seem like the ATX version might not be compatible with such an old system.	St
1.1.5	Based on some research I *think* I could get by with an ATX 12v 1.x unit, or perhaps older would work.	St
1.1.6	I'm just wondering what exactly I should look for, if anyone had any suggestions, and what sites would be good for looking up / purchasing an older power supply.	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I see what looks like a bog standard ATX supply.	St
1.2.2	Today's newer ATX 12V units even with the newer 24 pin ATX connection let me slip off the 4 pins and it's back to 20 pin ATX.	St
1.2.3	All that you need to do is check the mechanical or &quot;does it fit?&quot; Bob	St
1.3.1	24 pin connector that separates into a 20+4 should work.	St
1.3.2	If used for a server running 24/7/365, pay attention to efficiency as cheap PSUs are not usually efficient power wise.	St
1.3.3	Getting a better quality, high reliability, high-efficiency PSU would be the way I'd go.	St
1.3.4	PSUs that meet the aforementioned criteria should be easy to find online or at your favorite local vendor.	St
