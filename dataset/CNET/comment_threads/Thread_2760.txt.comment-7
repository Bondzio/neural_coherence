i had that problem before.. the module said 512Mb but after installing it.. the bios only stated 512Mb(i had 1 256 Mb module already installed).. i used another one but still with 512Mb.. then i got 768.. in that case.. the former had some problems.. try changing the module to another one.. the &quot;512Mb&quot; i had when i installed it alone was only 256Mb.. dunno why.. i hope i am of some help..
