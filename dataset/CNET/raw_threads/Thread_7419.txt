I usually have Cinema 4D and Terragen rendering at the same time along with Photoshop and Paintshop Pro running along side each other. Not to mention WMP playing music 24/7... My Dell is almost always running at 100% and sometimes does not respond for hours on end. I need a PC that can handle all this, but still come at a price under $1600 with a good sized hard drive and efficient memory...thanks

Don't know if you can do that in your budget though,as the procesoor alone costs $1000. However, doing perhaps 2 of those applications and wmp would be pretty okay on the emachines t6212. If you're going to do all 4, i don't really know. I don't think AMD athlon 64s were built to multitask, but depending on how olds you dell it would still probably be faster.

It is a total budget pc, and you're willing to spend $1600. Go with a custom computer either made by Monarch, Cyberpower,ibuypower,velocity micro, overdrive, alienware,falcon northwest, voodoo or many others/ build your own. If you have no clue about buildigny our own or do not like the reputations of those companies and want an oem. Go for the Dell 9100 with a Pentium D. Should be within your budget and be good for multitasking.

That is just an ordinary run of the mill computer that can be had with just about any maker of PC's for that price range, and IMO is not the one for you. It has the 754 Socket motherboard which is being phased out in favor of the 939 socket, 80GB hard drive (you need more), 512MB RAM (you could use more..like 1GB), and a low end $45-$50 Video Card. Since you have so much rendering and running at the same time, IMO you need just what Ozos suggested, a computer with the new DUAL-CORE processor. Here is what another guy (Ksoiehawo) is planning to build with the Dual-Core Processor & motherboard: His post in the PC Hardware Forum http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=110914&messageID=1262200 All prices are from Newegg: Case: $125 Antec Performance TX1050B /w Antec Smartpower 500W Power Supply Motherboard: $224 Asus P5WD2 CPU: $363.99 Intel Pentium D 830 RAM: $89 (DDR-2, 533 PC4200) Corsair Value Select PC4200 1024MB (2x512MB) Video Card: $166 (or the Gigabyte 6600 PCIe @ $107) Gigabyte 6600GT (PCIe) HDD: $112 Seagate 200GB SATA FDD: Mitsumi 7-in-1 (Mitsumi 8-in-1 card reader w/floppy $20) DVD Burner: $36.99 BenQ 1620 DVD ROM: $33 BenQ 1650 Sub total at Newegg purchase $1149.98 + shipping Would also need a Operating System Win XP Home w/SP2 $83.95 And if you do not already have, add: Speakers..inexpensive ($20+ A 56kbps Modem (aprx $10-$20) A Router (aprx $15-$25) An inexpensive keyboard & mouse. (aprx $30) A Monitor.....Newegg has some good buys on several 17'' Acer LCD's with 8ms & 12ms from $214 -$245. So everything above, aprx $1543.75 which is within your $1600 budget if you build yourself, or pay a little more to have an experienced shop/person build it for you for $xx.xx At Velocity Micro you can configure a computer with the Intel Pent D 830 dual-core 3.0GHz processor for $2300: http://www.velocitymicro.com/wizard.php?iid=20 You can configure a pretty good Dell 9100 computer with a Pent D 820 processor with: 1GB dual channel DD2 RAM at 533Mhz 250 GB SATA 7200RPM Hard Drive Dual Optical Drives = 16x DVD-ROM & 16x DVD+/-RW w/dbl layer write 9-in-1 Media Card Reader with 3.5 in Floppy Drive 17'' CRT Monitor ( can sell and get the Acer 17'' LCD) 156MB PCI-e Nvidia GeForce 6800 Video Card IEEEE 1394 adapter Dell speakers Dell Keyboard & mouse 56kbps Modem 1 year warranty/service (can get more for $'s) Other software Above $1409, well within your $1600 budget.
