your hsf's can't possibly be adequately coupled for heat transfer to the cpu's.
you may have too much thermal grease on them, however, i suspect that the clamping system is fouled up.
clamping the hsf's tight enough can be a very scary process.
of course they may be totally inadequate hsf's.
i assume while experimenting, the case is off thus the general issue of cooling the total interior of the case is not a problem.
are the fans running at top speed?
if plugged into the mobo with three pin connectors they are temperature controlled, maybe the controllers are bad.
get adapters to run the fans at full 12 volts by connecting to the big molex connectore.
