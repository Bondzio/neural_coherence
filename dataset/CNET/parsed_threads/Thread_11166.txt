<s> I have problems connecting my printer to my laptop. </s>
<s> The other day I had to buy a new laptop as my old one had died on me. </s>
<s> I have a network with 2 pc's and 1 laptop. </s>
<s> 1 pc is used as a server for data and printing. </s>
<s> This is a 32 bit Vista machine. </s>
<s> I have a Canon iP4200 printer hooked on the pc. </s>
<s> My new 64 bit laptop runs windows7 home primium sp1. </s>
<s> So up untill now connecting my laptop/pc to the printer has allways been a piece of cake. </s>
<s> But unfortunately with my new laptop it won't work. </s>
<s> Here's what goes: 1) configuration =&gt; printers 2) add a printer =&gt; networkprinter 3) it surches my network and yes it finds a printer connected to my pc. </s>
<s> it's adress: \\PC_BOVEN_02\Canon iP4200 4) click next and it starts connecting to the above mentioned printer. </s>
<s> 5) after a while a screen pops up: No driver has been found! </s>
<s> Click OK to manually surch for the driver. </s>
<s> So I click OK 6) I enter as a path: C:\Windows\inf (suggested by Canon when I contacted them). </s>
<s> 7) I get back on step 6 no drivers. </s>
<s> I asked cannon and they say they do not have a seperate driver. </s>
<s> When I connect the printer through USB it automatically connects. </s>
<s> No Sweat. </s>
<s> Cannon doesn't seem to have the answer. </s>
<s> Who does?? </s>
<s> (I used to have a 32bit windows 7 laptop and that worked well.) </s>
<s> I found this: http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_ip_series/pixma_ip4200#DriversAndSoftware and there are 32 and 64 bit drivers for both Vista and Windows 7. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain that you're going to need to force the installation of a driver. </s>
<s> See the link below or google about mixing 32 bit and 64 bit drivers for shared printing. </s>
<s> It gets complicated and there's no one answer. </s>
<s> But you'll need the proper driver as a beginning. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> it worked!! </s>
<s> thanx. </s>
<s> What I do not understand is why the helpdesk from canon tells me there are no(!) </s>
<s> seperate drivers available. </s>
<s> This place here is much better then there helpdesk!! </s>
<s> thanx again. </s>
