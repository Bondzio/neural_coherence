1.2.1	the p3 topped out at 1ghz.	St
1.2.2	there was a 1.26ghz, 512kb cache p3 chip but it was a rare beast and was not supported by most chipsets.	St
1.2.3	a 1.2ghz celeron may work, but it really won't provide any performance boost.	St
1.3.1	You could find and plug in the sligthly faster P3 that did fit the socket, the BIOS may balk and the power supplies may not be up to the task.	St
1.3.2	Don't do this.	St
1.3.3	Look to other areas for a little speed such as enough RAM for the OS in use and maybe a video card upgrade.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
