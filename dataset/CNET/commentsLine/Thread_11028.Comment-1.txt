i don't have a dvd-burner [never even bought a cd-burner (stop laughing!)]
but i'm planning to buy one & install it in my pc.
someone told me to be careful of which make/manufacturer i buy because some are being made with digital rights management technology built in.
this doesn't make sense to me.
what little i know about drm makes it sound like software looking for...well, whatever it is that signals a copyrighted file.
would the 'driver' file somehow stop working?
i'm not planning to steal movies, but after the sony fiasco last year i don't want to trust corporate suits more than i have to.
is there some feature or warning i should look for on the box to avoid 'big brother' drm features built-in to the burner?
