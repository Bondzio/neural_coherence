cisco still offers design and deployment services.
but you see a new type of it staffer that uses what they learned on home wifi networks which is a discussion on its own.
that 100% uptime is nothing i'd sign up for.
example?
since wifi is easily disrupted by a bad device and you have devices such as phones and more, no one would sign up for this if they knew.
a wired network is not subject to this since we can manage the port and shut off the offending unit.
also, since there are only 2 non-overlapping 802.11n channels, did you plan to pull back to 802.11g to give your design more channels?
