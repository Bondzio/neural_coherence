<s> I want to install a new harddrive and operating system on a older dell machine. </s>
<s> I beleive it is a dell dimension 500 xps running windows 98 with a 20 G harddrive. </s>
<s> Would this be practical with out changing the processor and mother board to something faster and more up to date? </s>
<s> Also it has only 128 mb of ram I no this is not sufficient. </s>
<s> Any opinions would be appreciated ........ </s>
<s> I'm not fimilar with all of Dell's model numbers. </s>
<s> But since you said Win98 I'm guessing that it is PIII of some kind. </s>
<s> Well 128mb for Win98 is ok. </s>
<s> But if your PC has rambus memory it will cost big $$$$ to add more. </s>
<s> XP will need more memory, with 512mb as the sweet spot. </s>
<s> Try an 80gb HD. </s>
<s> With out knowing all of you PCs specs it may or may handle a larger drive unless you partion it. </s>
<s> If it is an older system it you might want to consider geting a new PC. </s>
