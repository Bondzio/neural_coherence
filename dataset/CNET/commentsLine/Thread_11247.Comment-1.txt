a while ago my 350w psu failed so i replaced it with an antec truepower trio 550w.
i connected it to my asus m3a motherboard and when i turned it on, sparks came out of that motherboard.
the motherboard is wasted, and i was told that something with cpu voltages went wrong, i don't really understand, but anyhow, i need to get a new motherboard.
i want it to either be compatible with the 550w psu and my athlon 64 x2 dual core 6400+ (because somehow, that's where it went wrong).
or if you say it's silly to buy a new motherboard and not a new cpu, which ones should i buy, that are compatible with eachother, my psu, my memory (i really don't have a clue what type or ram it is, i could check if you want).
i really need some help with this, i want to avoid another &quot;fireworks party&quot;, and need my pc up and running again soon.
