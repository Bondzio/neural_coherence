1.1.1	I am looking for a 2.1 system and I like the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 .	St
1.1.2	Now my question is has anybody ever hooked up bookshelf spreakers or any other speakers to this system ?	Ques
1.1.3	If so , how did it sound ?	Ques
1.1.4	I have two JBL62 speakers laying around that have a 6 & quot ; woofer and a 1 & quot ; tweeter and probably are better than the Klipsch satellites .	St
1.1.5	How well would this work ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 've got a pair of 62Ts connected to my main stereo amplifier but in a basement room .	St
1.2.2	I 'd rate them as OK but not terrific .	St
1.2.3	My primary speakers are an old pair of JBL L65 Jubals bought in the '70s .	St
1.2.4	They make the 62Ts sound like a budget boom box from Walmart .	St
1.2.5	Believe it or not , I also have a set of Klipsch Promedia 2.1s connected to my PC .	St
1.2.6	I think there is more than one version of these .	St
1.2.7	Mine have a black and orange plastic oval near the bottom that says Klipsch THX .	St
1.2.8	If you have these same speakers , I 'd say leave them alone .	St
1.2.9	I would n't consider trying to connect them to the satellite wiring .	St
1.2.10	They work well with the sub woofer .	St
1.2.11	I do n't see what a couple more small woofers are going to add and I also doubt that the signal from the sub woofer would be properly equalized to power other low frequency speakers .	St
1.2.12	I doubt that 's what you 're looking for but ca n't offer much encouragement here .	St
1.3.1	They are just called JBL62 exactly , thy are older but today I just bought the promedia 2.1 and my left satellite distorts around half volume .	St
1.3.2	I 'm also finding out that the sub ca n't take much at anything close to half volume .	St
1.3.3	Am I missing a setting or something ?	Ques
1.3.4	I 'm wondering if my JBL 62 speakers can replace the Klipsch speakers so it does n't distort on me .	St
1.4.1	If so , the obvious answer is to return them under warranty rather than risk losing it .	St
1.4.2	If you bought them & quot ; as is & quot ; , the distortion could be a blown speaker ( loose coil ) , bad volume control potentiometer or something as simple as loose hardware inside .	St
1.4.3	Somethings you can find and fix this .	St
1.4.4	Replacing the satellites is going to mean cutting and splicing some wire and dealing with the volume controls for both the satellites and the sub .	St
1.4.5	You 'd have to fabricate some method of doing this .	St
1.4.6	I seriously doubt that you 'll get better sound from the old JBLs than from a good working Klipsch outfit .	St
1.4.7	As for the sub woofer volume setting , I run the dial no higher than 9 to 10 oclock or bass tends to get muddy .	St
1.4.8	Most all of these systems will do this .	St
1.4.9	The extra power generated by its amplifier was never intended to allow you max out the volume controls .	St
1.4.10	It 's there for damping and such to improve the accuracy of the speaker by controlling its travel .	St
1.4.11	I really like my Klipsch speakers and hope you get your problem resolved .	St
1.5.1	Yes I bought the system new , I will consider exchanging it for another after I try a few more things with it .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for your help and advice .	Polite
