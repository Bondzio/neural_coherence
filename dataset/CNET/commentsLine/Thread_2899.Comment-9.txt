i'd suggestyou build your own.
right now there's a free course forming on cnet that covers building your own computer.
it's for a high powered gaming system, but the principles are all the same; only the components would be different for a slower system.
you can get mobo and processor combinations pretty cheap.
if you have a micro center near by, you can go look at the mobo and decide what you want; need.
shop online for the operating system.
