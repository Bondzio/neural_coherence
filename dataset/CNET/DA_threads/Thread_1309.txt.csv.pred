1.1.1	hi ... i have AMD 2000+ & quot ; PVCLE266M-L & quot ; i want to make it fast so wat should i do , like what should be added to it for egs ram , some PCI accesories , etc	St
1.2.1	Add system RAM , a hard drive , a video card , a PSU , and an operating system and it should work .	St
1.2.2	Not what you were expecting ?	Ques
1.2.3	That 's because we have no idea what you already have installed on that motherboard besides an & quot ; AMD 2000+ & quot ; CPU .	St
1.3.1	i have 512+256mb ram 40gb hdd , and this PVCLE266-m is a mercury motherboard and processor ( builtin processor ) so what changes can i do , i have windows XP and Windows 2000 , and windows 2000 is extremely fast and win Xp is like below average , so wat should i do to make XP fast , other than diskdefragment , etc only components	St
1.4.1	In terms of hardware upgrades , probably adding a PCI ( not PCI Express ) video card with its own dedicated ( not shared ) video memory will provide the best performance boost .	St
1.4.2	HOWEVER , new Core 2 Duo and Athlon 64 X2 systems are a steal right now .	St
1.4.3	I 'd lean towards investing in a new computer .	St
