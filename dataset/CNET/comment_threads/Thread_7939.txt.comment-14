Sorry I thought I had posted that info.
I also was wrong on what Dell it is.
It's actually Dimesion 4550 not a Inspiron (that is my laptop).
Not sure if it's any help as I didn't post it but the Audio Device is Unimodem Half Duplex Audio Device.
I'll give Dell a try and post whatever results I get.
