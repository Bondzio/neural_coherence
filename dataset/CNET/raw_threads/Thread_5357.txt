My problem is: when I call customer support, I get somebody that speaks English, but with a very heavy accent. I find it really hard to communicate with them. I think the next time I call...I'm gonna tell them I want somebody that speaks English clearly.

That should get you to another person. Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. Suppose you were an idiot. . .

Sorry, but that's the way it is, if you like to do something about it, write(email) your local congressman(woman) and state your displeasure and/or write to Dell, not email. good luck -----Willy
