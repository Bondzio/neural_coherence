<s> So this is kind of hard to explain... </s>
<s> I live in an apartment complex that provides internet as part of the lease. </s>
<s> We have a internet switch in a closet that sends internet to different rooms. </s>
<s> When we connect via cord the internet works perfectly fine. </s>
<s> But when we connect a router to the internet it works for a bit and then stops (wired and wireless). </s>
<s> But when we unplug the router and plug in the computer it works no problem. </s>
<s> We tried two routers and both do the same thing. </s>
<s> Both routers work just fine when used with other peoples (that do not live in my complex) internet. </s>
<s> There is no problem with the computers connecting to the router. </s>
<s> I can get to the set up and settings console via wireless no problem. </s>
<s> So what I'm asking what could be causing this to happen? </s>
<s> Is there something that can cause a router to stop working yet the computer can overcome? </s>
<s> I could not figure out how to edit my post so here is some more info. </s>
<s> My current router is a TP-Link TL-WR841N. </s>
<s> My roommate and I both have windows 7 computers. </s>
<s> It's noted in the forum sticky. </s>
<s> But you can google it too. </s>
<s> The words for google are: HOW TO USER A ROUTER AS A WAP. </s>

<s> Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. </s>
<s> Well I hope. </s>
<s> I don't know much about these things. </s>
<s> Hence why I came here. </s>
<s> I don't know what a WAP is so how can I find it in the stickies? </s>
<s> I looked in the four for this forum and it was all gibberish to me. </s>
<s> That's why I asked here. </s>
<s> No one expects folk to be a network guru overnight. </s>
<s> Unlike some places with a FAQ, here we only have the posts in these forums and some stuck to the top AKA &quot;stickies.&quot; Bob </s>
