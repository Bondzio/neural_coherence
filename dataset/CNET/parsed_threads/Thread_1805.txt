<s> I recently converted all family videos (dating back to the 50's) onto DVD. </s>
<s> I have two copies of each. </s>
<s> One kept at a relatives house. </s>
<s> And the other in the safe at my house. </s>
<s> I know DVDs don't last forever, so how often should I re-burn them all? </s>
<s> Is there anything else I should do to make sure they are safe? </s>
<s> Should I rip them all to my hard drive as well, even if its going to take 50gb? </s>
<s> In theory they should last for years, but how can we be sure? </s>
<s> You might slip a disk into the drive tomorrow and 'bang', it's gone. </s>
<s> By burning them to DVD rather than having just one copy stored on a hard drive you have done the sensible thing. </s>
<s> Too many don't even do that and when the hard drive fails they lose everything. </s>
<s> You can certainly copy them to your hard drive and that makes watching them more convenient, but hard drives fail quicker than CD/DVD, so those backups in the safe are important. </s>
<s> I would never treat anything saved onto an internal hard drive as a backup copy. </s>
<s> Backing up to an external hard drive may be as good as you can store the hard drive somewhere as well. </s>
<s> But just remember that external hard drives are just as prone to break as internal. </s>
<s> As long as you have one good working backup copy, as well as the originals, then that should be fine. </s>
<s> But as soon as one fails, backup again. </s>
<s> Perhaps a 2nd set of DVD's might allow you to feel more secure. </s>
<s> Remember though, as technology moves on and improves, better backup options might arise. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Hmm, well a lot of the originals are reel-to-reel tapes that are already degraded. </s>
<s> So they can't be trusted. </s>
<s> So I guess I should have a copy on my hard drive (I change my computer every few years, so its going to move with me through the years). </s>
<s> Then have two DVD copies, one stored at my house, the other somewhere else. </s>
<s> Then I just have to check the DVDs every so often I guess. </s>
<s> I just wish there was a more reliable back up option. </s>
