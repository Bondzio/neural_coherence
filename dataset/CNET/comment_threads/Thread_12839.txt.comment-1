Hi, Posted a thread in Windows 7 about OS on SSD C: drive but now have a hardware (I think) question.
When I press the space bar to come out of hibernation it comes back on (so the keyboard works then) but then the keyboard and mouse don't work at all and I'm dead.
Have to press the power button and restart.
It's a custom built, bought all the parts at Fry's and Fry's put it together for $60.
It works great except for this so far.
Here are the specs if you know what they mean.
I'm new w/ Win7 so could it be a setting?
