<s> About 3 weeks ago, my PC started to turn itself off totally, whether or not I'm using it. </s>
<s> There was no error message or any kind of warning. </s>
<s> Rarely it would restart by itself, but usually it wouldn't. </s>
<s> And the strange thing was, I couldn't restart it at the CPU casing unless I turn off the main switch at the 3-pin power outlet socket at the wall of my room, wait for a while, switch it on again and then restart my PC. </s>
<s> I sent it to the computer shop for diagnostic, and the technician there said the hard disc was dead and I had to get a new one. </s>
<s> I did, and my PC worked perfectly fine for around two weeks. </s>
<s> Now it started to turn itself off again, exactly like before, randomly and frequently. </s>
<s> I sent it to the computer shop again, but it wouldn't turn off itself there!! </s>
<s> The technician switched it on for one whole day and nothing happened. </s>
<s> As soon as I brought it back to my room (university hostel), the problem occurs, whether my Windows XP Pro had been loaded or not. </s>
<s> I scanned for viruses and errors using Norton Systemworks, but there was none and my Firewall is up and running. </s>
<s> The temperature never exceed 45 Celsius. </s>
<s> I've also disabled every auto-off or auto-restart functions of the PC, but it still turn itself off ( &gt;10 times a day ). </s>
<s> I even got some technician to check the power outlet in my room. </s>
<s> Nothing's wrong with it.Please help. </s>
<s> My Hardwares: Intel P4 1.8AGHz / 512KB Cache + Fan Biostar SIS 650, DDR, Sound + VGA + LAN Mother Board Micron PC-266MHz 256MB DDRAM Samsung 1.44MB FDD Maxtor 40GB, 7200RPM, ATA133 IDE HDD (previously) Maxtor 80GB 7200RPM HDD (now) A-Open 40X12X48X INT.CDRW Drive ATX ZEUS LX W/350W DUAL FAN PSU </s>
<s> It sounds like a power issue to me. </s>
<s> Do you have a surge protector between the computer and the wall outlet? </s>
<s> You may want to try a UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) to see if you are getting voltage dips/spikes. </s>
<s> If you do get a UPS, make sure the voltage rating is sufficient for your computer and don't plug your printer, especially laser printers, into it. </s>
<s> If that doesn't remedy the problem, you have either a faulty power supply or mobo. </s>

<s> I'm no expert however, I suffered similar problems in that my comp, without warning, would switch itself off completely and then restart and boot to the welcome screen as if nothing had happened. </s>
<s> I persevered for around three months until I could take it no more. </s>
<s> I checked all my wiring connections inside my comp to start - no probs there! </s>
<s> I did a virus scan - no probs there! </s>
<s> I changed my RAM - still had the problem. </s>
<s> Then I changed my PSU from a FSP 250-60 GTA (250W) to a Jeantech 400W (30 from PC World) - Problem cured!!! </s>
<s> Since changing the PSU (it has been running for around two months now) I have not experienced any more unexplained shutdowns. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
