hi, i have 2 imacs at home, a g4 and a g5.
i love them.
i now need to buy a lap top for my work.
the question is, should i buy a windows or a mac.
i would love to get a mac, but i am concerned that at this time, some programs will not run on it (and it is work related..) , even given the new boot camp software.
advice ?
???
thanks, galit.
