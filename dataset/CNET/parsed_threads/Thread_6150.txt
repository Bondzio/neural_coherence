<s> recently my VERY old desktop just stopped working so i am trying to buy a new computer. </s>
<s> I would like a basic desktop for a reasonable price. </s>
<s> any suggestions? </s>
<s> i was planning on getting the dell but im not sure if i want to go through the hassle of ordering it off the internet </s>
<s> some folks say $1500 is reasonable. </s>
<s> do you want a new monitor? </s>
<s> what about printer, speakers, etc. </s>
<s> what do you want to use the pc for? </s>
<s> shop the retail units at circuit city/best buy/office depot/etc first, then check the reviews at cnet.com and pcmag.com to help you decide. </s>
<s> i'm looking for a very basic desktop. </s>
<s> im looking for soemthing around 400- 700 dollars including monitor. </s>
<s> i've found some like compaq,hp, acer and gateway but i have no idea which ones are best for its price. </s>
<s> i think this is the one im gonna get http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/HP-Pavilion-Desktop-PC-A6009N/sem/rpsm/oid/178512/catOid/-12962/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do can u tell me if this is good or not? </s>
<s> it says there is no built in wireless... would there be a way to upgrade it so it can? </s>
<s> or could i buy a long wire? </s>
<s> $700+ after rebate It only has 1GB ram. </s>
<s> Vista runs better with 2GB. </s>
<s> It will run though. </s>
<s> but here's a good package deal (with a slightly faster cpu) for $664: http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/175660/bundleId/9899/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The thing that is nice about dell is that you can upgrade your computer and get it with exactly what you want. </s>
<s> The problem is that you start with a reasonable system for $500 and u make a few upgrades and all of the sudden its $1000. </s>
<s> Emachines are okay systems with great deals but they dont last long before it takes 20 mins to start up the machine. </s>
<s> In my personal experiences gateway has been the best brand i have dealt with. </s>
<s> They have a nice selection with reasonable prices but dont lack the quality factor. </s>
<s> Recently (Christmas Time) i bought a Gateway with a gig of ram, 250 gig hard drive, dual core processor (2.1 ghz) with XP Media Center Edition for $650 and thats with a 17 inch lcd and a printer. </s>
<s> Recently i have seen in the adds computers with 2 gigs of ram, 320 gig hard drives, dual core processor, vista premium and 19 inch lcd with a all in one printer for about $700. </s>
<s> I dont know what you consider reasonable but that sounds nice to me lol. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> Chris </s>
<s> I have a system almost exactly the same except its a Gateway. </s>
<s> I was pleased with everything except the dual core processor wasnt as fast as i hoped. </s>
<s> theres a few things i dont like about this computer. </s>
<s> i dont like how i cant hook up my old hard drives into this computer. </s>
<s> they dont use the old gray cables to connect. </s>
<s> instead, they use something ive never seen before. </s>
<s> another huge problem is the soundcard. </s>
<s> i use the mic alot for my job and most people cant hear me clearly. </s>
