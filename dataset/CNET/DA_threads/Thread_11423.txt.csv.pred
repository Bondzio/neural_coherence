1.1.1	I have narrowed my desktop search down to 2 Gateway computers.	St
1.1.2	The perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840.	St
1.1.3	It is a great computer for the price and performance you get.	St
1.1.4	But, since I have $600 in Bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this Gateway model, I am having a hard time deciding what to do.	St
1.1.5	They do however carry the DX4831-01e for a great price.	Polite
1.1.6	Both computers seem VERY similar (CNET gave the SX2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers?	St
1.1.7	And am I going to be dissapointed with going with the DX instead of the SX???	St
1.1.8	Any advice would be great.	Polite

1.5.1	To be a bit beefier with more weight, larger power supply, more PCI slots, one more USB port and such.	St
1.5.2	The rest is identical.	St
1.5.3	The i3 CPU is a nice choice over the older core 2 duo and even older machines.	St
1.5.4	Sounds like a nice machine.	St
1.5.5	No 3d card but there is a slot for one!	St

1.6.1	I may go with the DX since I have all the credit at BB.	St
1.6.2	I guess the tower is bigger on the DX, but I have plenty of room so that is not a concern.	St
