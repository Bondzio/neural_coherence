I did unplug and replug the modem and the router countless times.
Same thing.
I have plugged the modem into the computer.
I got the internet.
When plugged to the router everything seems to worl fine.
I get all the lights, I can access my network, my laptop gets a signal, but the internet doesnt go to my desktop or laptop.
