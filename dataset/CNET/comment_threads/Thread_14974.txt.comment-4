There's KNOPPIX which I can boot and backup to CDR or networks.
Read http://tips.oncomputers.info/archives2004/0401/2004-Jan-11.htm If the volume is FAT32, a DOS diskette can be used to slowly drag off that thesis paper or what can't be lost.
If you can get a second hard disk, in a pinch you can install the OS on that, add the original drive as slave and recover files (most of the time.)
There are options.
