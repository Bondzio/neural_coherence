the reason you would need a static ip address for a networked printer is because each client that prints to it needs a specific address to send their print jobs.
dynamic addressing, which can change at each power cycle of the device or router, would defeat this.
any other machines on the network can stick with dynamic addressing.
so you would use the software that comes with the bizhub to establish a static ip for it, pointing back to the router's ip as the default gateway.
the rest (adding the printer to each pc) should be explained in the manual.
