I plugged it in via FW400 to my pc, but it doesn't show up in My Computer. It is recognized as a volume in the safely remove hardware section, but won't give me access to the files. I've tried updating drivers etc via the Device Manager to no avail. How can I get my external hd/music back? BTW, I'm running Windows XP pro. Thanks!

Back to the Mac and copy the files over to a NTFS or FAT32 file system for now or boot Linux and use Fuse. Bob
