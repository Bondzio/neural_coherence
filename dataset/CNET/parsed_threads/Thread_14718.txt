<s> I recently got a Compaq 5-button wireless mouse from my uncle. </s>
<s> He didn't have the software but said I could get it off the internet. </s>
<s> I downloaded the driver and installed. </s>
<s> Now the buttons on the new mouse work but when I try and move the cursor it won't register. </s>
<s> Also, the mouse wheel on my old mouse won't work anymore. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> And where can I get drivers, I think this might not be the right one. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> it's an optical mouse, not one with the ball. </s>
<s> Only install ONE mouse driver package. </s>
<s> Never 2. </s>
<s> Use system restore to go back. </s>
