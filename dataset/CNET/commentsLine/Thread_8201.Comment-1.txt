okay so i was in bios and decided to do a really stupid thing.
i saw this place that said cpu speed.
it stated 133mhz.
i hit enter.
it said to put in a value bewteen 133 and 200, so i put 200. and then i saved and exited.
anyway, it went to restart, and i have no response from my monitor.
i use another video card (so i don't use my onboard one).
i tried plugging the monitor back into my old onboard video with no success.
at startup the hard drive dosen't do its usual beep.
please help.
do i need to reset bios?
if so, how would i go about doing that without actually going in to the bios.
i dont think my mobo is shot, because i recieve the annoying long beep if i take my ram out.
the only other thing i can think of is that the processor is shot.
i put my ear close to it and can hear noise but i'm not sure if thats how it usually sounds because i dont ever listen to my processor up close.
in case its important im using win xp.
2.4ghz processor, 512 ram.
i dont really care if i lose whats on my hd so much(most of it is backed up) and the other stuff is on my ipod.
please help!!
ps i posted this in the computer help forum as well.
im not sure which is appropriate.
