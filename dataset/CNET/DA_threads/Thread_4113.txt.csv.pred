1.1.1	I've looked high and low searching to see if the on board video card (Intel 82915G/GV/919GL)in my HP with XP will support 1440 X 900 resolution.	St
1.1.2	It does not appear in the display settings so does that mean it won't?	St
1.1.3	I've looked both at Intel's site and at Samsung's site for info but found nothing.	St
1.1.4	I also searched here and didn't find a direct answer.	St
1.1.5	Any info would be great, thanks.	St
1.2.1	http://support.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-022544.htm notes the basic supported modes.	St
1.2.2	It also notes what to do about getting the latest drivers.	St
1.2.3	Cheers, Bob	Polite
