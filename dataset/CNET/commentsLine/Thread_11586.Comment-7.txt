you are saying that commercial dvd's do not mount or play on your computer?
is that correct?
you then say that you can play these dvd's using vlc.
do you have another optical drive that you are using to play those dvd's?
you have not told us what mac you have, how old it is or what os you are running on it, but it could be that something is not quite right in the (software) state of denmark.
i know this is old, but, run the disk utility and repair permissions on that drive.
did it make any difference?
another interesting thing is that you say that the disks that do not mount, appear in toast.
how so?
if the disk does not mount on the desktop, if is unlikely to appear in toast.
maybe not impossible, but unlikely.
as bob mentioned, drag and drop can be problematical, on either platform, with mixed results for any given burn.
toast, on a mac, is the preferred method of burning.
make sure that you have the recorder settings &gt; advanced; set to &quot;write disk&quot; and not &quot;write session&quot;.
this is another problematic area with the mac.
most times it will work correctly but when you most need the data, it will not.
btw, session written disks appear as separate volumes on the desktop.
anyway, there's a few questions, look forward to the answers.
