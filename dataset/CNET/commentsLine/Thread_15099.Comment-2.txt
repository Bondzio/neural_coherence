i'm not a gamer.
if i price out the parts for a pc and a monitor and software i can't come close to what i can buy a package deal for.
but that assumes that all the parts of a pkg deal are of any value to you.
i'm not looking to buy a new machine but every so often i visit dell's bargain shop.....nice stuff....yesterdays model....cheap.
there is a benefit to building your own.
you gain a certain amount of knowledge about how the parts fit together and when it does not work quite right 'you' just go in an fix it.
