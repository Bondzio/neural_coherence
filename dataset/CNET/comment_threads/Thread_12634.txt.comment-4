It is possible that your software firewall on each of the laptops is limiting your speed.
I used Computer Associates Firewall with my RoadRunner and it slowed my speed down to a crawl [700 k].
When I turned off that firewall and used windows firewall my speed was okay [at least 5mb].
You could probably do without a software firewall simply because the router has it's own firewall built-in but I personally use window's version anyway in addition the the router's.
