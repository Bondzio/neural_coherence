my usb 2.0 connected 160gb drive formatted in less than one hour.
but since you have a p3, 99.99% of p3s will have usb 1.1. let me do a guess on time here.
i'll state that 160gb completed in 1 hour on my p3-600 usb 2.0 connected drive.
if that was true and you connected via usb 1.1 (likely!
), then a straightforward bit of math shows... usb 2.0 speed / usb 1.1 speed times 250 / 160 = hours or... 480 / 11 times 1.56 = 68.18 hours.
you'll have to give it about 3 days.
