1.1.1	Just wondering because the Sound Blaster X Fi only has 3 line outs.	St
1.1.2	I'm guessing more than one speaker channel is encoded on a line and it is separated within the speaker system or receiver.	St
1.1.3	Well I'm pretty sure a speaker set for PCs could do it, not sure about a receiver.	St
1.2.1	3 jacks?	St
1.2.2	If it's jacks, then these jacks are probably in stereo (is my guess).	St
1.3.1	Of course!	St
1.3.2	Can't believe that didn't occur to me.	St
1.3.3	One channel with have front L/R, another will have rear L/R, and the third will have center.	St
1.3.4	The speaker system I guess will then decide what goes to the sub and what finally goes to the speakers.	St
