1.1.1	My old HP Pavilion dv9207us stopped working and I purchase a new HP Pavilion dv3-2155mx notebook .	St
1.1.2	The old computer will not start up .	St
1.1.3	I pulled out the external hard drive ( Western WD 1200BEVS ) SATA 2.5 & quot ; and purchased a Thermaltake BlacX docking station ( P/N : ST0005U ) to transfer data onto my new notebook .	St
1.1.4	It says it should easily transfer SATA 2.5 & quot ; and 3.5 & quot ; hard drives .	St
1.1.5	I am can not connect my hard drive to it .	St
1.1.6	Do you know why ?	Ques
1.2.1	The dock looks to be the right part but you 'll have to tell more .	St
1.3.1	Itis actually an internal hard drive ( The WD 1200BEVS ) .	St
1.3.2	The connection & quot ; Teeth & quot ; on the internal drive do not appear to map directly into the docking station .	St
1.3.3	Is there any other information I should provide ?	Ques
1.4.1	The dock looks right to match your SATA 2.5 inch laptop drive .	St
1.4.2	Now having said that , I found this docks to be rather flimsy and non-intuitive when it slides & quot ; home. & quot ; You have the right parts .	St
1.4.3	Here 's a cable I use instead of the docks .	St
1.4.4	- & gt ; http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=2020 ( many out there like that . )	St
