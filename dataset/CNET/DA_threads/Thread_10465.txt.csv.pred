1.1.1	Good Day to All I have a printer ( Canon iP 5300 ) and the printer overall works fine .	St
1.1.2	But as soon as I try to print on a Disc , using the CD Tray , I ca n't seem to print in black .	St
1.1.3	I started from scratch , and made a monochrome Picture , which is either black or white , and when I print the Picture using CD Label Print supplied by Canon , it prints Cyan ( blue ) instead of Black .	St
1.1.4	I tried selecting & quot ; Print in GrayScale & quot ; but it still comes out blue .	St
1.1.5	I contacted Canon about this , and I 'm still waiting for an answer .	St
1.1.6	I updated all the drivers and software , And I tried installing the Printer on a Mac OS X Desktop , and from that I 'm still getting only Blue .	St
1.1.7	When I print on an A4 Page , then it can print Black , but simply not on the Discs .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone assist me by telling me if there is something I 'm missing , or if this printer is capable of printing black on Discs .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	I 'm having the same issue .	St
1.2.2	Were you able to resolve what the problem was ?	Ques
1.3.1	I have same problems with my MP610 .	St
1.3.2	I think it 's the problem in cartbridgs , becous when I was using original Canon colors it was ok .	St
1.3.3	But now with other cartbridge bradn it prints cyan insted of black : s Tried on the same dvd-brand ( verbatim printable ) Funy is that other colors are ok only black is problem .	St
1.3.4	On paper is evrything fine .	St
1.3.5	If any one have a clue what is the reason pleas write me : rok.dezo [ AF ] gmail.com	St
1.4.1	I have been trying to print with my remaining big black C3 cartridge on CD/DVD media with Canons CD-Labelprint using my Canon ip5000 .	St
1.4.2	It has never succeeded .	St
1.4.3	Not even with a brand new cartridge .	St
1.4.4	I think it could be due to the fact that when printing and choosing printer properties I get a limited set of choices .	St
1.4.5	There is a selection with a drop down list called & quot ; BJ Cartridge & quot ; which is limited to only one item on the list : COLOR .	St
1.4.6	I suppose it will then use all available cartridges except the big black C3 cartridge .	St
1.4.7	That , I suppose , is the reason the disk comes out just as white as it was before attempting to print on it ...	St
