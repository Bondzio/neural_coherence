1.1.1	Room mate just purchased a Presario 502us laptop with a built in WLAN NIC with the broadcom chipset running Vista Basic Home edition .	St
1.1.2	The WLAN card recognizes various wireless networks in the immediate area .	St
1.1.3	I can connect to the router via cable through the Ethernet NIC .	St
1.1.4	I have several other computers currently active on the wireless network .	St
1.1.5	All the other systems are running XP Pro SP2 I do not see my wireless network on the 502us even though I see other networks including one creatively named & quot ; netgear & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	Because the CG814WG is distributed to several ISP 's , Netgear does not support the firmware and my ISP has been little help since I could n't get past tier one support .	St
1.1.7	Anyone out there have any ideas I might try ?	Ques
1.1.8	Anyone else experience any issues with Vista or Broadcom chipsets and this particular modem/router ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in advance for any help .	St

1.2.1	Are owners that have wifi routers that connect to all machines but one .	St
1.2.2	It 's hard for them to accept it when I reenable SSID broadcast , turn off wep/wpa and get it connected .	St
1.2.3	We then experiment to see what security does work .	St
1.2.4	We also test the laptop at hotspots if it does n't connect .	St
1.2.5	If it does n't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it 's either a bum install of the OS or dead hardware .	St
1.2.6	Sometimes the owner did n't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off .	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	No other settings needed to be changed , just was n't picking up the SSID until I reset the broadcast settings .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply , -Rob	St
