1.2.1	the drivers for anything that came with it from the Compaq website which I think is now HP since they merged .	St
1.2.2	Search for the Model # in google and you should get to the correct site .	St
1.2.3	If you reformat the drive using the regular format you will also lose access to the bIOS .	St

1.3.6	You go through a process of inserting the different floppies back and forth OR use the floppies by themselves at boot that will present BIOS/setup to you .	St
1.3.7	3. then make a primary DOS fat32 partition and load win98 .	St
1.3.8	You 'll have to have the downloaded drivers on a CD or slave Hdd .	St
