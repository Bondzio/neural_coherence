<s> Hi, I have been with you guys for years now. </s>
<s> Always love to read the stories. </s>
<s> OK, question is video cards. </s>
<s> I don't remember seeing this as a discussion. </s>
<s> My current card is a ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series. </s>
<s> Computer is a Dell 546 with AMD Athlon II 4x 620 Processor with 4 gigs ram. </s>
<s> I run Win 7. </s>
<s> This is for the people who like details. </s>
<s> So I play WOW and Skyrim and all was fine till a few weeks ago. </s>
<s> It plays fine on my laptop and on an old XP I have but I get these great pie shaped slices throughout the screen on the Dell. </s>
<s> AMD Catalyst did download a new OS 12.3 and if memory serves me right is was about then the problems started. </s>
<s> I don't know how to roll back to the previous version and the other thing is this only happens on this computer. </s>
<s> I pulled the card and put it into my XP and it seemed to run fine. </s>
<s> No pies or patches on the faces of the characters. </s>
<s> I put it back into this machine and it happens again. </s>
<s> So my thoughts are: 1. </s>
<s> The Dell machine puts too much into the card and it starts to not work, overheats or something 2. </s>
<s> The OS from Catalyst is the problem. </s>
<s> Responses I think would help is how to roll back Catalyst or can I dump that video software and run something else? </s>
<s> If so, how to dump it? </s>
<s> Any other suggestions appreciated. </s>
<s> I am thinking of building a gaming computer, if so, what graphic card is coming up with good marks nowadays? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Your post is testament that consumers are no longer willing to live with beta issues. </s>
<s> After over a decade, you still see issues like this. </s>
<s> Sorry, it's an area that the consumer may have to vote by returning products that don't work or require ARCANE steps and driver hunts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I fixed the problem myself. </s>
<s> Went to Youtube and did a search on uninstall all ATI programs Did that and my video worked again. </s>
<s> I don't know the fault ATI and Catalyst had but now I have great 1280 x 800 video and all games look good again, Happy camper, </s>
