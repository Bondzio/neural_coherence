1.1.1	I am having some strange problems connecting to the internet on windows xp .	St
1.1.2	A while ago i could connect to the internet through a few things .	St
1.1.3	I used both the Opera and Firefox web browsers and occasionally internet explorer .	St
1.1.4	I also have yahoo widgets that I use a weather forcast widget that gets its info from weather.com .	St
1.1.5	It has been a while since my problems began , so i dont remember when , but all of a sudden firefox claimed that there was no internet connection , yet all my other options were still functional .	St
1.1.6	For a while i only used opera .	St
1.1.7	Then a few weeks ago I tried internet explorer and found that it too had gone the way of firefox .	St
1.1.8	Well then i wanted to see if it was Opera that was doing it , so i uninstalled opera and tried both , but they didnt work .	St
1.1.9	Then I reinstalled opera and found that now IT did n't work .	St
1.1.10	The reason i wanted this fixed is because my creative zen mp3 player isnt working and i got a recovery tool to try , which needs the internet , but was also not finding it .	St
1.1.11	At this point the only thing that seems to be able to access still is the widget for some reason ... I am really stumped .	St
1.1.12	I am using a wireless card , and tried swithing to LAN , but that didnt work either .	St
1.1.13	I tried spyware scaning with DR.web , but after i deleted the files it found , i still do n't have a connection .	St
1.1.14	Any help is appreciated .	Polite
