1.2.1	The first thing to check is the small print of your contract with your ISP .	St
1.2.2	If that does n't allow sharing WiFi outside your own home ( and usually it does n't ) , this discussion is a no-go on this forum .	St
1.2.3	So please provide a link to their TOS .	St

1.6.1	Put the router in LOS of the target and then off to the kitchen to soup up the WiFi .	St
1.6.2	Here 's the video .	St
1.6.3	http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=YOBfxbpxosA 50 meters might not need anything but I find folk stick the router in the basement then ask why WiFi is so terrible .	St

1.11.1	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yard_ % 28sailing % 29 Just last week I read a manual with the phrase & quot ; metric meters & quot ; and will have to see why they added that .	St
1.11.2	Bob	St
1.12.1	I thought you wrote & quot ; 50m away from in LOS & quot ; so what are you saying here ?	Ques
1.12.2	If it 's not in Line Of Sight ( LOS ) then it 's not and all bets are off .	St
1.12.3	You can forget about 300 Mbps since that 's under ideal conditions such as 6 meters or less with no obstructions .	Sug
1.12.4	Try plain old 802.11g settings on the router .	St
