&quot; I can't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you didn't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters.&quot; Well, sort of, but not really...
I just seem to have connectivity problems when I'm running two wireless adapters in such close proximity.
Also, the desktop in my studio is running linux, and I have not been able to get my adapter to work, despite hours of hacking and fiddling.
