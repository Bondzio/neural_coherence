for anyone else who has this or similiar problems: first i installed a program called treewalkdns (  ) which replaces windows xp dns structure or something like that.
i found it recommended in pc advisor for anyone with dns problems or even anyone using a windows xp network.
secondly, i disabled zone alarm on the host pc.
(i had tried this previously without the tree walk program so i'm thinking its a combination of both) i don't really know what was wrong with zone alarm, i think something wrong with port forwarding but of course disabling it is only a temporary solution so i'm going to have to sort that now.
