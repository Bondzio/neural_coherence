1.1.1	My note book battery recently has taken a turn for the worse .	St
1.1.2	It fully charges in about 15 minutes and discharges in 5 minutes .	St
1.1.3	The battery has been handled properly and charged/fully discharged a few times a week ( the battery is only 6 months old ) .	St
1.1.4	I think the problem may be w/ the power management portion of the software .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas I can try besides buying an expensive new battery ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most laptops have a one year warranty .	St
1.2.2	Use it .	St
1.2.3	The expense of a new motherboard will just upset you .	St

1.3.1	I 'm having the exact same problems with my notebook battery .	St
1.3.2	I 'm very sure that is is n't a software problem , because i 've swapped the hard drive and performed a fresh Windows installation .	St
1.3.3	I 've also updated the BIOS of my notebook ( PB E3255 ) , but even that was n't the solution .	St
1.3.4	So if it is n't the software , it 's the hardware .	St
1.3.5	With this in mind , I began to brainstorm and i figured out this : The battery is n't dead of weak , but & quot ; he thinks & quot ; he is .	St
1.3.6	The solution to this problem is do completely discharge the battery , so that 's what I 'm doing now .	St
1.3.7	First Windows shutdown my notebook because the silly OS thought that the battery was running low ( 4 % to go.. ) .	St
1.3.8	After being shutdown , my notebook did n't want to start again because he still & quot ; thought & quot ; that the battery was empty .	St
1.3.9	So I took the battery out , and I 've put it back in after 10 seconds .	St
1.3.10	After pressing the On button , the notebook boots up and keeps beeping that his battery is empty .	St
1.3.11	He 's doing that now for the last 45 minuits until he 's REALLY empty .	St
1.3.12	I 'll post my results tonight , when I 'm sertan that this is the sollution .	St
1.3.13	With kind regards , Le Chuck	St
