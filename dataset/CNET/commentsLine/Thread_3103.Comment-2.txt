if you looked at very early computers that used tubes, they often had a rudimentary backplane.
later these advanced to such as the vmebus  and for the personal computers the s-100 was very common.
with the apple 1 you see the beginnings of the motherboard where the computer was small enough to be put directly on the backplane.
