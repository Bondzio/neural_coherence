The most common cause for this is there is one or more pgms.
already running in the bkgrd.
doing thier tasks, thus the defragger repeats when in conflict.
I suggest you hit the Clt+Alt+Del keys once and see what's running, and kill the tasks not required(leave MS ones) for the time being and allow the defragger a chance to finish.
You can also, check the &quot;startup&quot; of files to see if you can disable during such defragging.
If your systemtray is more than 3-4 icons present, check them to disable, try one at a time for best operation.
Check into areas... good luck -----Willy
