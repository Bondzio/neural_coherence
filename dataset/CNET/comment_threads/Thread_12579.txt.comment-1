I have an HP Desktop that came with an AGP video card that has died.
I have an Nvidia PCI card that I installed and have display.
I have been reading that the motherboard supports only one type.
Obviously mine would support the AGP as it was in it when bought.
Can I do this or do I have to buy another AGP.
