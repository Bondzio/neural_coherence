the typical 10.3 installation is about 3 gb - there is little chance that you can install it on this hd, especially since you probably already have programs and files take take up more than 1 gb.
there is no way that you can easily run 10.3 on this small space, even if you are somehow able to install it.
i would get at least a 20gb drive, install it in the g3, and put the old drive in an external usb enclosure, so that you can use the old drive as a backup.
good luck!
