I am guessing that because you replied &quot;ouch&quot; and there is no way to pair the dual drives outside of Maxtor's magic one touch box my situation is bleak?
I do have a redundant backup, but capacity is not as large as the TB.
So I do not do full backups on the redundant.
Just when I thought I was safe with a single backup drive, now I have to have a backup for the backup?
Where does it all end!
