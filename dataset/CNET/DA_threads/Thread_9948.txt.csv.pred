1.1.1	i recently took apart my pc to clean the inside it was a bit of a mess .	St
1.1.2	i put it all back together and changed the IDE Cables as they were causing some problems .	St
1.1.3	For a while i could not use any form of disc not even CD roms .	St
1.1.4	since i changed the IDE cable CD roms will work but still not DVD discs .	St
1.1.5	when i say DVD 's i dont mean dvd format , just any dvd disc including ones that i have used to back up files .	St
1.1.6	i get the following message in event viewer .	St
1.1.7	the driver has detected a controller error on device 0. my hard drive and dvd drive are on separate IDE cables but both are using the master connection .	St
1.1.8	could someone explain where the controller is and what is its function ?	Ques
1.1.9	im assuming its on the mother board .	St
1.1.10	i built my machine about 2 years ago and not really had any problems .	St
1.1.11	except from time to time i am unable to boot untill i switch my PSU on and off several times .	St
1.1.12	this has been happening much more frequently recently .	St
1.1.13	i did have to change my board before when it failed to work for that reason .	St
1.1.14	asus A8R MVP 32 Delux amd 4000+ can not remeber my dvd drive or my hard disc models .	St
1.1.15	i will post more info soon if necessary	Sug
1.2.1	is to replace the dvd drive .	St
1.2.2	they 're so cheap that it 's not really worth troubleshooting .	St
1.3.1	& quot ; i am unable to boot untill i switch my PSU on and off several times .	St
1.3.2	this has been happening much more frequently recently .	St
1.3.3	i did have to change my board before when it failed to work for that reason. & quot ; This issue is usually traced to a few items .	St
1.3.4	Try CMOS BATTERY , power supply and motherboard .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	ok thanks , ill try a new cmos battery but i doubt its that as this problem has been persistant with 2 boards and when i try boot it dosnt even get as far as the POST screen , which totally cuts out the CMOS , i could possibly try flashing the BIOS when i get my net up and running again .	St
1.4.2	unfortunately i dont have a case speaker which makes matters worse .	St
1.4.3	im tempted to say that the booting problem lies with my PSU .	St
1.4.4	as for my dvd drive , buying a new one would be the easier alternative but id rather find out what is causing this problem .	St
1.4.5	could someone explain where the controller is located .	St
1.4.6	is it on the board or the dvd drive itself ?	Ques
1.4.7	and what is its specific funtion ?	Ques
1.4.8	cheers spoon	Polite
1.5.1	A failing IDE device will stop systems from booting .	St
1.5.2	- & gt ; Let me ask this .	St
1.5.3	If unplugging or replacing said drive fixes this , are you asking to dive deeper into the failure beyond a bad drive ?	Ques
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	good point , my sister has a spare dvd drive which i will try tommorow , ill try unplugging it tonight to see if it resolves these issues and ill get back to you tommorow .	St
1.6.2	and yes i would like to know everything possible as i am still learning .	St
1.6.3	to get to the root of the problem rather than just replacing and forgetting .	St
1.6.4	thanks mate .	Polite
1.6.5	spoon	St
1.7.1	The root of the problem today stops at the DVD drive due to the costs involved of troubleshooting it deeper than that .	St
1.7.2	If you wish to go beyond that and look at this deeper you would be researching how the IDE bus works , the BIOS source code on initializing said BUS , the use of oscilloscopes and more diagnostic equipment .	St
1.7.3	Most of us will just replace the unit since the time spent on troubleshooting a dead drive is not worth it .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
