Hi I've got an ASUS A8N-SLI motherboard with the above processor.
I installed all the pieces myself.
However, the chipset fan is occasionally flakey - makes a racket trying to get up to full speed - and my PC seems to like to freeze more often than I would like.
So I would like to return the motherboard... but am afraid of breaking heatsink/cpu/something.
Has anyone got instructions for removing the CPU - simply reversing the installation would appear to risk a, too much brute strength and b, nasty separation of the heatsink from the CPU.
Thanks Darren.
