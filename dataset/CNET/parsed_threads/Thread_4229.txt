<s> I am in the process of buying a new computer and I cant decide on the name brand or any. </s>
<s> I have an IBM Aptiva 2170-831 it still in good condition, but some of my DLL files I have lost somewhere. </s>
<s> What do you guys think. </s>
<s> Do I need to do BUY or UPGRADE. </s>
<s> H-E-L-P Thank you, </s>
<s> its always cheaper to buy individual parts and pop them in your old case. </s>
<s> A typical upgrade would be getting a new mobo/cpu, more ram, and maybe a bigger hard drive. </s>
<s> if your a gamer a new video card is always a must. </s>
<s> www.newegg.com seems to have the best deals on parts. </s>
<s> dll/'s are software files. </s>
<s> Perhaps you just need for do a repair install of the software. </s>
<s> Better yet, format the drive, then do a clean install. </s>
<s> If the machine is satisfactory and the dll issue is the only problem, this can be repaired. </s>
