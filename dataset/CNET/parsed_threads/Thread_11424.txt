<s> New Gateway FX6801-01; primary hard drive working normally, two additional hard drives installed, and at least once a day, one of the two secondary hard drives 'disappears'! </s>
<s> Reboot, and it's back. </s>
<s> If I have only two drives, the primary drive is OK, and the other drive 'disappears'! </s>
<s> Why am I 'losing' a hard drive from the system, 'sometimes'? </s>
<s> Failing drives or a power supply that dipped out at the right time. </s>
<s> With 3 drives and what else, is that the stock power supply? </s>
<s> And are you ready for the drives to vanish? </s>
<s> Backups all done? </s>

<s> These two additional hard drives are installed in the system's 'removable' slots...with one hard drive in place, it sometimes disappears; with two installed, one of them sometimes disappears. </s>
<s> Reboot returns system. </s>
<s> Power supply should not be considered a culprit, as it works with one or two removable drives. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea about how this may happen?? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Removable bays especially IDE are well known to flake out over time. </s>
<s> I won't go into details but it is all about age, electrical noise increases due to capacitor aging and more. </s>
<s> Here's the problem. </s>
<s> The owner will likely tell you &quot;It worked before&quot; or &quot;It's worked for years.&quot; But don't let that bother you because that's the normal response to this and other age related issues. </s>
<s> Press on with updating 40 conductor cables to 80 conductor as well as outright moves to a bigger single drive. </s>
<s> Those that must have removeables usually are trouble at the shop counter. </s>
<s> Be sure to put on your best smile and help them save their files first and then let them figure it out that such may not be a supportable configuration. </s>
<s> Help them toss the drive trays and connect it up directly. </s>
<s> The moment the owner declares it can't be something, then the likelyhood increased it is that! </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
