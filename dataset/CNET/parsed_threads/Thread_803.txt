<s> Hi everyone. </s>
<s> I've been having problems with programs that act as servers. </s>
<s> For example, I use JumiMouse, which is an iPhone/iPod app that allows you to connect to your computer at home over a network or internet connection. </s>
<s> It works like Remote Desktop, except that it is faster and works on computers that can't use Remote Desktop, like mine. </s>
<s> This program is supposed to work over the network and the internet, but it only works over the network for me. </s>
<s> (JumiMouse has two parts: the iPhone/iPod app and a server program on my computer.) </s>
<s> I have tried making my computer the DMZ server. </s>
<s> Didn't work. </s>
<s> UPnP is on. </s>
<s> Doesn't make a difference (it's always been on). </s>
<s> NAT is set to Open. </s>
<s> Doesn't work. </s>
<s> I have tried forwarding ports 53, 88, and 3024 to my PC. </s>
<s> (This was for an Xbox 360 connection before I could set NAT to Open, it kinda worked, figured I'd try it.) </s>
<s> Didn't work. </s>
<s> I've read that it could be some firewall. </s>
<s> The SPI firewall has been disabled for some time, so that can't be it. </s>
<s> That's the only firewall I can see that is provided by the router other than the wireless password/encryption. </s>
<s> This has all been done in tandem with each other. </s>
<s> Still doesn't work. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Hi. </s>
<s> Since you have already mentioned that you tried forwarding ports to your PC, I will assume you know how to forward ports within the router. </s>
<s> The ports associated with JumiMouse are not explicitly mentioned. </s>
<s> However I found the following tip that may help you. </s>
<s> PC should have a different listening port (e.g. </s>
<s> 5720 & 5721). </s>
<s> Set these in the Jumi Controller & enter the same port numbers in the &quot;Connection Settings&quot; in the Jumi App. </s>
<s> Finally forward these ports in the Router. </s>
<s> I hope that works. </s>
<s> Take care. </s>
