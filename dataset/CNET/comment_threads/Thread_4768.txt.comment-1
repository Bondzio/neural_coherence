OK...I have a tough one.
I read the review of the Dell Studio XPS here: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps/4505-3118_7-33396858.html?tag=mncol;lst It is sweet.
I bought it and realized that the keyboard included in the picture is not the one that my system is shipping with.
Nobody at Dell seemed to know what it was either...they looked at the pic on CNET.
If you zoom in, it is a Dell-branded item and it appears to have a cord.
I love that low-profile look and I want it but I don't know what the heck it is!
Any ideas?
