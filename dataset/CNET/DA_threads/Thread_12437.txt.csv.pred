1.1.1	I am a first-time computer builder who just finished his first build - and no problems!	St
1.1.2	I have two 640GB hard drives that I have put into RAID configuration, with 200 GB worth of mirrored RAID1 space and approx.	St
1.1.3	800GB of striped RAID0 space.	St
1.1.4	I am a little confused about the best way to allocate my programs and my system onto my space.	St
1.1.5	I have an awful lot of large files to copy over and create(i do a lot of graphic design) and music and pictures, hence the 200GB of RAID1.	St
1.1.6	I have also put windows vista x64 on the RAID1, as i don't want to go through the headaches of reinstallation if something goes wrong, and set the RAID1 part as the primary boot partition.	St
1.1.7	I plan on putting the rest of my programs (adobe suite, autoCAD, assorted games) on the RAID0, along with general non-backup needed files.	St
1.1.8	Am i taking full advantage of the RAID array I've created?	St
1.1.9	should I put the OS on the RAID0 partition?	St
1.1.10	currently EVERYTHING is set up ono the RAID1 part, as i've just set the thing up and installed windows.	St
1.1.11	if i should change something, i have no problem reinstalling things or reformatting my system now when it is squeaky clean.	St
1.1.12	also - i am a new vista user and kind of a newbie in general - doing a bit of learning by doing.	St
1.1.13	if you advise doing something with the page file or crash dump or anything like that, please either explain or send a helpful link.	Sug
1.1.14	thanks for the help matt	Polite
1.2.1	put all of your apps and windows tree on the raid1 (i assume c:) drive.	St
1.2.2	reinstalling apps is a pain especially if they issue a lot of patches.	St
1.2.3	create a fixed pagefile on your raid0 drive (assume d:) of 2-3gb.	St
1.2.4	shrink the pagefile on c: to 64mb (just enough to hold a kernel dump).	St
1.2.5	change your temp folder to one on d: as well as temporary internet files.	St
1.2.6	use d: for your adobe/autocad scratch device and games, music, video, etc.	St
1.2.7	if you're using vista business or ultimate, turn on shadow copies for any document folders.	St
1.2.8	basically put anything you can easily restore from backup on d:.	St
1.2.9	anything that has to be reinstalled should be on c:.	St
