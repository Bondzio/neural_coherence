<s> Hello I want to record videos with Fraps. </s>
<s> I want to buy a new PC that can handle the games bellow at full settings + recording at full size without lag (for me that means steady 60+ FPS). </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> My budget is around 1100$ or 800 I live germany but have the option to go to the US from time to time. </s>
<s> For the first step it would be good to find the parts that I need even if it goes above my budget. </s>
<s> Then we can find sales where I can match my budget. </s>
<s> List of games: -Splinter Cell Chaos theory -Splinter Cell Double agent -Splinter Cell Conviction -Call of duty 5 -Call of duty 6 -The elder scorlls 4: Oblivion (Guilds, expansions, Arena and main quest.) </s>
<s> -Assassions Creed 2 -Mafia 2 -Half-life 2 -Grand theft auto 3 -Grand theft auto Vice city -Grand theft auto San Andreas -Grand theft auto 4 -Crysis </s>

<s> Okay I will try that. </s>
<s> But if that doesn't work please try to help me here, thanks. </s>
<s> Fraps only has support or? </s>
<s> I looked and coudn't find forums. </s>
<s> Many don't want to sign up to get at the forums there. </s>
<s> You? </s>
<s> Subtittle above. </s>
<s> To enter you will be prompted for your username and password. </s>
<s> # Your username is the email address that you used when purchasing. </s>
<s> # Your password is the word or phrase you specified during registration. </s>
<s> Do you possibly mean the support form? </s>
<s> Where you put in your email address. </s>
<s> I have done that. </s>
<s> Sorry but this is where I'd ask such a question. </s>
<s> It would be unlikely to find support for this, but the Members Area would be where others would share about this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There is only the support there. </s>
<s> Any other things I can do? </s>
<s> Frankly I think you may want to tell me you didn't buy the software. </s>
<s> Maybe that's why all these posts. </s>
<s> Here's my thought on this. </s>
<s> Get some nice quad core machine, and those higher end GPUs and you're done. </s>
<s> If you want NO LAG you'll have to wait another year. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are you saying that I downloaded the software? </s>
<s> No I baught it legit! </s>
<s> About the lag thing. </s>
<s> BS. </s>
<s> The members area. </s>
<s> You may need some on site help or training. </s>
<s> Why not a nice i7 machine with the Radeon HD 5970 ? </s>
<s> I found the members area with ease but I didn't find the forum that F*cking doesn't exist. </s>
<s> Sorry, about the parts you suggested a bit more exact would be great with motherboard and case psu etc... </s>
