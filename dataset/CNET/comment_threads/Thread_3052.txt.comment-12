If cd boot fails then that is caused by &quot;something else.&quot; I noted dban but I can remove partitons with gnome tools too.
Maybe the issue you haven't pulled the trigger on this?
Some fall into analysis paralysis.
Or want an authoritive answer, a manual, step by step, etc.
I can only be clear on one thing.
If I can't boot a CD, it's not due to what's on or not on the hard disk.
