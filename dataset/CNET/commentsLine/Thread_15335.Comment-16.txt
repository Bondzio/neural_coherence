i have to agree with msgale.
the extra crap installed by dell is going to affect the speed of the pc from day 1, and not wait until 3-4 years later.
all of the other junk that is installed along the way (commercial software, shareware, freeware, hardware drivers, etc.)
will accumulate to affect the speed over time.
for that reason, reinstalling the os, even from the original disks containing all of the original crap, will return the speed that you experienced when you first purchased the pc.
