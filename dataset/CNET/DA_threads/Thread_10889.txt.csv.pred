1.1.1	Dear Computer Jedi !	St
1.1.2	I am torn between two computers .	St
1.1.3	I am able to get a & quot ; discount & quot ; on Lenovo computers but would like to know if it worth it .	St
1.1.4	Lenovo will charge me $ 1000 for this computer .	St
1.1.5	They SAY it is worth $ 1700 which I think is untrue .	St
1.1.6	What are your thoughts ?	Ques

1.1.9	Thank you , Michael	St
1.2.1	One is what you would get for a business machine , boring , stable , support lines , etc .	St
1.2.2	The second is what a GAMER would want .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	WOW !	St
1.3.2	I am with Bob , window # 2 would be pretty nifty if you want to do some gaming .	St
1.4.1	I like Velocity Micro 's stuff , but Lenovo has been doing good things with the old IBM lines .	St
1.4.2	The machines are apples n oranges .	St
1.4.3	Curious what the OP 's purpose is .	St
1.4.4	Heads up : Every Velocity Micro I 've seen I 'd be embarrassed to put in an office .	St
1.4.5	Not as tacky as alienware kinds of stuff , but the glowing blue LEDs scream out gamer-geek , true chick/client repellant .	St
1.5.1	I agree with that comment , Lenovo HAS done some good things , so do n't rule them out , again it depends on what you are going to be doing .	St
1.6.1	I forgot to comment on the prices .	St
1.6.2	There 's no way the Lenovo 's true value would be $ 1700 , even imaginary retail price .	St
1.6.3	Comparable towers can be had under $ 1000 .	St
1.6.4	The price on Velocity Micro is typical for them .	St
1.6.5	They use good components .	St
1.6.6	I wish it had better than 8500GT , but that really depends on the needs -- it 's a workable gcard for sure .	St
1.7.1	I went into Microcenter here in Cambridge , MA and they custom built a beautiful powerful and quiet computer for $ 870 .	St
1.7.2	I am very happy with my computer with runs Vista Ulitmate very well .	St
1.7.3	After further research the Lenovo was n't worth the discount and Velocity was overkill .	St
1.7.4	Thank you for all of your input .	St
1.7.5	And thank you Joonil Park who really customized my computer to my needs .	Polite
1.7.6	It was nice to have an intelligent human touch .	St
1.8.1	lenovo vs velocity same cpu speed ( 3ghz ) same ram quantity ( 4gb ) 250gb vs 320gb intel integrated vs 8500gt graphics an 8500gt is not a gaming video card .	St
1.8.2	a good video card ( 8800gs or hd3850 ) would cost about $ 120 .	St
1.8.3	60 extra gig is n't that much ... a 160gb external drive is about $ 80 .	St
1.8.4	so , for $ 200 you could upgrade the lenovo to be much better than the velocity .	St
1.8.5	if you 're not a gamer and do n't need the extra 60gb , stick with the lenovo and enjoy your savings even more .	St
1.9.1	Thanks for letting us know .	St
1.9.2	Sounds like you got just what you wanted , and a local operation too .	St
