<s> In an email in MS Outlook Express (Windows XP, sp2), when I click on a hyperlink within an email message, one of the folders on my computer shows up instead of launching Internet Explorer and linking to the particular web site. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how do I correct this? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> http://windowsxp.mvps.org/IEFIX.htm notes this but another possibility is the Tools, Options, Security in Outlook Express is set to not allow such. </s>
<s> Worth mentioning is that some PESTS (virus/other) do this via email so I'll write it is unsafe to click on links in emails. </s>
