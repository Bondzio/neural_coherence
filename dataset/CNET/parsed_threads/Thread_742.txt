<s> Hi All, I recently bought a good digital SLR. </s>
<s> then realized I needed to take a course in Photoshop. </s>
<s> While taking the course I noted the MAC monitors in school have much better resolution and color separation than the 20 monitor that came w/ my pc. </s>
<s> I dont want to buy a MAC so I figured I could upgrade my screen and then buy a spyder to calibrate it. </s>
<s> I am looking for a good 24 to 27 unit that is not in the nosebleed price range (over 1500$) The specs on the machine are; 2.4 GHz quad core w/ 3 gigs of memory and an Nvidia Geforce 8600 GT card. </s>
<s> The machine has no problem handling Photoshop CS4 Any help can get w/ this decision would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks, Apple 25 </s>
<s> than any other PC monitors (if we can call that). </s>
<s> Just go get the best you cab afford. </s>
<s> Or maybe one with led backlited one. </s>
<s> It is soppose to give better contrast ratio (but I don't how important that is to your work). </s>
<s> Also maybe a better video card might help as well (just guessing here). </s>
<s> just make sure they are not TN monitors. </s>
<s> Get the make and model from the MAC monitor and then you can research the unit. </s>
<s> With the specs in hand.....go shopping. </s>
<s> available from other mfgs. </s>
<s> PC Connection has a nice search engine and an endless selection of monitors with a variety of specs. </s>
<s> Are you looking for a high-gloss or matte finish LCD ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> it doesnt look like the mac will hook up to a pc btw are you asking about the case of the monitor when you said glossy or flat? </s>
<s> if that's the question I couldn't care less if the case has pink polka dots on it as long as it will give me better color sep and depth </s>
<s> I have a 24 inch LCD with a matte finish LCD and a 17&quot; laptop with a gloss finish LCD. </s>
<s> I really like the 24 in LCD with the matte finish but really struggle with the gloss finish LCD on the laptop as it seems to reflect almost anything from anywhere. </s>
<s> I'm talking about matching the general monitor specs... dot pitch, viewing angle, contrast, color depth, etc., as the starting point to find LCDs that match MAC LCD specs. </s>
<s> Like you ...I can't fathom there aren't LCDs made by mfgs that aren't as good or better than those made by Apple. </s>
<s> Pink polka dots on the frame ? </s>
<s> .... think I'd find those distracting too. </s>
<s> Good luck and let us know what you decide on. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> how about that, since this is my first lcd desk top and I have never owned a lap top I didn't know they made the screens in gloss finish like the old crt's huh. </s>
<s> I started to look around on camera web sites and it seems the industry standard is LaCie, Eizo or Nec. </s>
<s> they all make models w/ caliberation software but they are all very pricey. </s>
<s> I don't think I'll be buying a 30&quot; any time soon unless I hit the lottery. </s>
<s> I live 20 min north of nyc and they have one of the largest camera shops in the world there. </s>
<s> I'm going to call them next week to see if they have any of the units set up for a look see. </s>
<s> I'll keep you up to speed on my selection. </s>
<s> to the gloss finish to get brighter screens with more vivid color to attract buyers. </s>
<s> They look great for the moment but for day after day long term use ... </s>
<s> I'll take the non-glare matte (non-glare) finish anytime. </s>
<s> Re visiting retailers in NYC....great idea. </s>
<s> No better way than first hand to find what pleases you. </s>
<s> Places like Best Buy, MicroCenter also have monitors on display you can see before buying. </s>
<s> We'll look forward to seeing your findings and observations. </s>

<s> I broke down and went for the big bucks. </s>
<s> I got a NEC LCD3090WQi 30&quot; unit and a spyder3 elite calibration software. </s>
<s> it was the cheapest pro unit in that size. </s>
<s> I am very happy with the setup. </s>
