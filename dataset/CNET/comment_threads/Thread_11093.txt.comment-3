I've not seen this on MBs with an internal device but could imagine such if the internal video is defective or disabled.
Did you check to see if it's disabled.
Drivers won't cause beeps as these are hardware failures.
Do make sure you are correct about the beep codes.
Bad RAM is another common cause of beeps.
