1.1.1	We have opportunity to obtain a number of HP 75A ( HP 92275A ) toner cartridges cheaply .	St
1.1.2	The problem is : the HP 75A is compatible with a LaserJet IIIp .	St
1.1.3	We have the discontinued model LaserJet III , and retailer specifications of the HP 75A cartridge omit mentioning our [ obsolete ] Laserjet III as an accepting printer .	St
1.1.4	Can we actually use the HP75A on our old Laserjet III printers even though there are no acknowledgements of the fact , or is the HP75A really , truly unusable on our HPIIIs ?	Ques
1.2.1	Having used a LJIII for many years , owning a IIp and had a IIIp at the office ( we wore it out ) , I can assure you the cartridges for these three models were NOT interchangeable .	St
