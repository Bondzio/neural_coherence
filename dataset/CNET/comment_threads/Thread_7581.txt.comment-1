I'm setting up my computer to use my living room screen and audio system for when I want to chill on the couch and watch web content, and I'm trying to figure out whether or not I can have both a wireless keyboard and mouse (for chilling) and my regular, wired set (for working) hooked up at the same time.
I'd prefer not to have to use the wireless stuff all the time.
Thanks.
