<s> You have to disable your integrated graphics first. </s>
<s> Then you can install the card. </s>
<s> Good luck:) </s>
<s> ...Your motherboard has an AGP slot? </s>
<s> then the onboard graphics chip is probably better than that card, unless the motherboard is really old. </s>
<s> What is your motherboard and why are you trying to install this card? </s>
<s> By using the info you provided for the video card, it is not much of a video card by today's standards. </s>
<s> Also sounds like the card may be faulty. </s>
