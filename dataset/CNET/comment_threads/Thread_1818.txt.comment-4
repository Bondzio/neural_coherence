The SSID name for the wireless network must it be the same as the workgroup name?
No.
But what many discover is the WEP/WPA doesn't work across vendors.
Updated firmware in the router may help, and sometimes does not.
Workaround?
None.
What can you do?
Either change the router or use MAC FILTERING.
