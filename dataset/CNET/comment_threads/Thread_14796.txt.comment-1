Hi, I am getting different answers from different people.
Could anyone shine some light on me please?
I am using a cable modem to connect to the internet, and I need wired internet access for 2 PC's (one Vista and one XP).
I don't have LAN configured, and I don't want the two PC's to be connected to each other.
The tech from my ISP told me that I just need a hub or switch, but the rep at the computer store told me that I need a LAN in order to use the switch, so if I don't want a LAN I should use a wired router instead.
So, do I need a router or a switch?
Also, if I connect more than one PC's to the router or switch, is the connection speed going to drop?
Thanks a lot!
