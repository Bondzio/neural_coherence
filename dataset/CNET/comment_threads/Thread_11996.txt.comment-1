I just bought a new Dell 9100 (haven't hooked it up yet) and I am wondering if I need to install the Norton Firewall software or not.
I am planning on buying the Anti virus, but wonder if I will need the firewall too.
If so is the Norton Security software good enough?
I seen it on Ebay for $25 shipped.
Sorry for the simple question, but I don't know alot about this sort of thing.
I only use dial up if that means anything.
Thank you
