<s> Hi, I have a wireless network setup in my house. </s>
<s> 4 computers are wireless and 3 are wired. </s>
<s> I have my router setup in my office, where two of the wired PCs are and one of the wireless PCs. </s>
<s> I've had a few issues since getting it, where I would lose a connection on one of my wireless computers, but it was infrequent and just didn't both me much with how often it happened... </s>
<s> I think these were just normal issues and nothing to be concerned about. </s>
<s> I've noticed lately that I tend to lose my connection a lot more now. </s>
<s> I have two cordless phones that I've set to different frequencies (or channels) and they don't really seem to interfere. </s>
<s> However, I'm finding that the microwave is now causing me issues and will disconnect me. </s>
<s> This is a little diagram of how I have it setup up. </s>
<s> r= router DDD= Door m= microwave [r---------------DDD-----------------desk with laptop [ [ Wall====== [ [ [kitchen [ [m The kitchen and office both exit into the same hallway, that then leads to the room where my computer is with the problems. </s>
<s> The microwave actually would be behind me, where the router is pretty much straight to my left. </s>
<s> Is there anything that can be done to prevent my laptop from losing connection when the microwave on, or is this an issue that cannot be corrected? </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> Any small leak will wipe out wifi connections. </s>
<s> So far no one has cured that issue. </s>
<s> But do tell us you have your setup per the forum sticky. </s>
<s> I was just wondering because I'd never noticed the problem before. </s>
<s> My connection has seemed really iffy these past several weeks. </s>
<s> The projects I've been working on have been a nightmare trying to get done with all the internet problems I've been having, so I was hoping there may be a cure it. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help! </s>
<s> You might try not using the microwave unit or remembering it will drop when its used. </s>
<s> Why it changes confounds many. </s>
<s> Remember that it could be like a recent find where the door didn't seal well. </s>
<s> I used a little of the common kitchen spray and paper wipes to clean the microwave around the door. </s>
<s> A seed was there and it didn't close all the way. </s>
<s> Silly humans... Bob </s>
