<s> I have an extensive network set up between 3 sites and am having some issues now that we have added more sites in. </s>
<s> We have one site with the internet connection router to wirless bridge to bridge via ad-hoc connection. </s>
<s> From there we have a switch connecting to another bridge via ad-hoc to the next bridge to a switch, and this is where we run into the problem. </s>
<s> We can hit the internet at the first two sites but the last cannot get on the internet. </s>
<s> The last site can ping, stream video from the main router at site one but unable to connect to internet. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> We have checked gateways on all bridges computers. </s>
<s> We set up a laptop at site one and connected no issues, the took it to site three and was unable to connect to internet. </s>
<s> Is there some limit on ad-hoc jumps, or are we missing something. </s>
<s> Any inputs would be helpful. </s>
<s> When attempting to connect to the Internet from site 3, do you receive any kind of message/failure message? </s>
<s> we are recieving no failure messages. </s>
<s> At site 3 we are getting DNS resolution, type in www.google.com or any web page address and we see status that it is searching for a IP for that specific site. </s>
<s> There is no limit to the number of hops introduced by Ad-hoc networking that I am aware of. </s>
<s> However, the 802.11 standard only briefly mentions bridging and does not define it well. </s>
<s> I have seen many issues with bridges trying to associate with APs. </s>
<s> Some bridges have an option to clone the first MAC that talks. </s>
<s> They then act as a proxy for all other devices behind the bridge. </s>
<s> Try looking for an option like this. </s>
<s> You did not mention address scheme so I can not tell if this is a routing issue or not. </s>
<s> Did you try a traceroute on the PC at Site 3 to your ISP DNS server or router? </s>
<s> Are you using managed switches? </s>
<s> Check the forwarding database on the switch to see what devices have been learned. </s>
<s> When bridging for the first time, same vendor equipment makes a big difference. </s>
