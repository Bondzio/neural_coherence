I have narrowed my desktop search down to 2 Gateway computers.
The perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840.
It is a great computer for the price and performance you get.
But, since I have $600 in Bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this Gateway model, I am having a hard time deciding what to do.
They do however carry the DX4831-01e for a great price.
Both computers seem VERY similar (CNET gave the SX2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers?
And am I going to be dissapointed with going with the DX instead of the SX???
Any advice would be great.
Thanks, Chris
