Baically what this means is that the output ports on your motherboard are configured for RAID - I know, mine are.
All you need is a normal IDE or ATA or SATA cable to conncect to your hard drives, and you're away.
By the way, if you can, add extra RAM, XP takes 512Mb on it's own, you really need iGb or better.
