I would uninstall the scanner and printer, then add back the scanner, shut down, reboot, then add the printer......shut down and reboot.
Then try scanning something simple, like text, to see if you are getting a printing connection.
I always try to stick to One MFG if I have 2 separate devices....just for the reason of compatibility.
