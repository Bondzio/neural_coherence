<s> I am currently looking at dual graphic card setup and currently am looking at the: EVGA 01G-P3-N891-AR GeForce 9800 GX2 1GB( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130338 ) with the mobo ASUS P5K deluxe ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131182 ) Does this work or am I going to have to look at a new motherboard, any advice would greatly help. </s>
<s> Are you putting in just one card? </s>
<s> If so, should be fine if the PSU and such is up to the task. </s>
<s> No I would be considering adding a second one and am wondering if it is possible. </s>
<s> My PSU is a 850w so I'm fine in that department. </s>
<s> Something to ask the board's maker and their support line. </s>
<s> there are hacked drivers for dual 8000 series cards but they're flaky. </s>
<s> and they definitely won't support dual gx2. </s>
<s> I decided to drop the ASUS name then since all they have in the price area is intel chipsets, and went with a EVGA ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188026 ) Let me know what you think or if you can find a better one for under 200 dollars let me know. </s>
<s> I think this should easily support the dual graphics card set up I want to do. </s>
<s> Again thanks for the input. </s>
