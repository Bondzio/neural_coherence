hey there.
i have a compaq presario sr1300an.
the spec's are:  i am wondering, is this computer worth being upgraded?
or should i build a new one?
i am interested in using it for gaming, browsing, listening to music, windows live messenger.
should i just buy a whole new pc or just build one.
if so can you help me find a cheap setup?
thank you
