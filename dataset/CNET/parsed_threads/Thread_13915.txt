<s> Hello Everyone! </s>
<s> I think I have thought of a way to backup my current HDD. </s>
<s> Would it be possible to buy a DVD Writer, put all my data on DVDs, install the new HDD and put files on? </s>
<s> But don't DVDs only hold video files? </s>
<s> I have a 9.39GB HDD and I am going to upgrade to 80GB HDD. </s>
<s> I am using a Desktop PC. </s>
<s> All suggestions appreciated, -Larry </s>
<s> anything you want to put on them..not just movies. </s>
<s> Might also consider going to 120GB...they're almost same price as then 80GB and they're under the size limit where almost any OS would recognize the full capacity (see 48bitlba.com). </s>
<s> Check over at Newegg.com ..they've got a wide selection of HDDs and and DVD burner's. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I'd just install the OS and everything else on the new HD and forget about the old 10GB clunker. </s>
<s> It'll be faster and quieter. </s>
<s> You can put any type of file on a DVD as long as it fits. </s>
<s> There are good dual layer DVD burners (read and write to both CD's and DVD's) for less than $40 online. </s>
<s> What is your computer manufacturer name and model? </s>
<s> What operating system? </s>
<s> My system details are: HP Vectra VL400 DT Windows 2000 SP3 (But I will probably upgrade to XP SP2) Pentium III Processor </s>
<s> You should be OK with a 120GB hard drive or smaller. </s>
<s> The issue of hard drives larger than 137GB: http://www.48bitlba.com/ http://www.48bitlba.com/win2k.htm * * * * * Your motherboard may not support newer Ultra ATA hard drives (ATA/66/100/133), so you may have to add an ATA/100/133 hard disk controller card to a PCI slot. </s>
<s> Something like one of these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Submit=ENE&N=2000150410+1193212548+119340940+1193512552&Subcategory=410&description=&srchInDesc= Also, make sure you use an 80-wire (not 40 wire) Ultra ATA data cable. </s>
<s> See the pictures here: http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html * * * * * The maker of your new HD has a free utility to transfer the image of the old HD directly to the new one. </s>
<s> This is much quicker than reinstalling the OS, drivers, OS patches, software, and personal files. </s>
<s> However, if I haven't performed a fresh installation of everything in years, I like to take the opportunity of a new HD to do just that. </s>
<s> It eliminates a lot of junk and fixes corrupt system files. </s>
<s> REMEMBER to implement your plan to backup all important file to CD or DVD before you try any of these solutions. </s>
