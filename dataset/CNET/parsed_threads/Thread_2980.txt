<s> Hey guys there was a post on here earlier about this, but its been deleted for some reason. </s>
<s> Anyways... Any of you guys heard about intellipaper? </s>
<s> They have information stored on a paper that goes into your USB drive. </s>
<s> They have a website but it doesn't show much of what the USB is capable of holding on it. </s>
<s> Has anyone out there used it? </s>
<s> It was spam about a vapor product someone is trying to get funding on. </s>
<s> Such posts are considered spam and are cleaned off without notice. </s>
<s> There is nothing new going on here. </s>
<s> Just someone trying the old SEO ploy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I guess I didnt notice that at all! </s>
<s> Was the original comment from Jenn a spam? </s>
<s> Crazy the things people do on here. </s>
<s> Thanks for the update though. </s>
<s> I still want to know whats up with this intellipaper deal! </s>
<s> If i could have business cards that had information on it to plug into a USB i'd totally get it for my biz! </s>
<s> Because of that. </s>
<s> It's gone. </s>
<s> The threshold for spam is set very low in the forums. </s>
<s> Again, it's someone trying to get attention about a funding drive, such posts are routinely deleted. </s>
