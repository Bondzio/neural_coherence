1.1.1	Hi , I have a desktop PC with Intel Dual Core 2.8 GHz processor , a motherboard with ATI Xpress 200 chipset .	St
1.1.2	The computer has 2 GB of DDR2 667 memory .	St
1.1.3	I want to add a Graphic Card to the configuration .	St
1.1.4	Now my question is if I add a Graphic card of the Nvida 2 series like the 240 , will the Graphic card confict with the configuration because of the ATI Xpress 200 chipset ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is it best to stick with the ATI brand of GPUs ?	Ques
1.1.6	Actually a few years ago , we were assembling a PC with Core 2 Duo E6600 processor , Intel Motherboard with 965 chipset , 4 GB of DDR2 RAM and a 8400 GT graphic card .	St
1.1.7	There was a conflict between the Graphic Card and the Intel 965 chipset motherboard .	St
1.1.8	The motherboard and the graphic card was sent to their respective support centers , but it was said they were working fine ( We suspected that either Mobo or G-card was having a problem ) .	St
1.1.9	Finally the problem was sorted out by swapping the Intel 965 mobo with a XFX NForce chipset mobo , and till date the configuration works like a charm .	St
1.1.10	So my question is , will I be facing any compatibility issues if I pair a Nvidia GPC card with a ATI Xpress Chipset motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.11	Or is it is best to stick to a ATI GPU card with a ATI Xpress 200 Chipset ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks for reading Sam	St
1.2.1	But the 8400 was a problem unit .	St
1.2.2	It was subject of many issues and recalls .	St
1.2.3	I would dismiss any 8400 troubles and move forward .	St
1.2.4	Then again I have a friend that tries to overclock and constantly has issues .	St
1.2.5	Go figure .	St

1.3.1	Thanks for your time and efforts , but the issue with NVIDIA 8400 and Intel 965 is history .	St
1.3.2	I want to know if you have encountered any issues with the NVIDIA 240 GPU and ATI Xpress 200 chipset .	St
1.3.3	I have configured PCs with Intel G31 and G41 chipsets as well as the X58 chipset ( Intel X58BP server board ) with NVIDIA GPUs cards ; No issues at all .	St
1.3.4	I am just asking because I have no experience with the ATI Xpress 200 chipset .	St
1.3.5	Thanks Sam	St
1.4.1	And the Nvidia card with the 240 which I have has never given me any sign of trouble but it 's on some Intel chipset .	St
1.4.2	I guess you can google it but keep in mind I can bet somewhere someone had trouble .	St
1.4.3	And then with each card , someone somewhere reported trouble .	St
1.4.4	My card has ( keeping it to my hardware ) been in the HP d4999t and d5000t without issue .	St
