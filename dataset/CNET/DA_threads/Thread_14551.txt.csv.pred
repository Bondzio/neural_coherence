1.1.1	My eMachines desktop with Windows XP crashed, due to missing or corrupted ntoskrnl.exe.	St
1.1.2	Now every time I turn on the PC, there's just an eMachines logo, a black screen and the missing/corrupt message.	St
1.1.3	I have the eMachines recovery CD but the PC doesn't read it.	St
1.1.4	I popped it in and out but my PC doesn't seems to recognize the disk.	St
1.1.5	It keeps asking me to re-install a copy of the missing/corrupt file but I can't do so without it reading the Recovery CD.	St
1.1.6	It also didn't allow me to type in any commands.	St
1.1.7	When asked to re-install ntoskrnl.exe, if I press any key, the PC would just reboot and then return to the error message.	St
1.1.8	I also tried pressing F11 or R and it activates a Recovery Program.	St
1.1.9	It gives me 2 options, to either format or back up the whole thing.	St
1.1.10	I can only mouse-click this so again, no command can be typed in.	St
1.1.11	No matter what I choose, the PC would just shut down every 4-5 minutes.	St
1.1.12	I've tried this more than 20 times and every single time, the PC would just shut down in the middle of formatting or backing up.	St
1.1.13	It displayed a blue screen saying that it needs to shut down to prevent damage.	St
1.1.14	There's also a string of number, I forgot to write it down but i think it was 0x00000023.	St
1.1.15	So I have the Recovery CD but can't use it to fix the missing/corrupted ntoskrnl.exe.	St
1.1.16	I also have access to the Recovery Program but can't do much because the computer reboot every 5 minutes.	St
1.1.17	I don't know what wrong or what I should do next.	St
1.1.18	Please help!	St
