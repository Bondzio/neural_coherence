hi there i need some advice on which tablet/pc hybrid to get.
i list below my requirements.
can anyone advise on what is already on the market, or due to come on to the market soon?
also, if anyone can explain to me about stylus pressure sensitivity: is this facility made possible by the type of stylus pen one uses, or by the technology of the tablet, or a combination of both?
any advice gratefully received.
tim my requirements: pc element: operating windows 8 tablet element: android pc/tablet configuration: connected as one unit and tablet detachable windows and apps operable from tablet on its own screen size: 10-13 inches (preferably 13) keyboard: full size palm block technology digitiser pen (for varying pressure) art software/apps that facilitate above storage space: not bothered on from standby time: min 5 seconds internet: wifi, 3g?
