1.1.1	I have a Dell Inspiron 2650 previously running on 256MB of memory with two DIMMS 128MB each .	St
1.1.2	After a while , I decided to upgrade my computer to 384MB by combining an old 128MB stick with a 256MB stick .	St
1.1.3	Now a problem arised after about 5 months - my computer would not start .	St
1.1.4	The power light would turn on , but the harddrive access light would not blink as it normally would .	St
1.1.5	I called Dell Tech Support and informed me it must be the issue of combining different sizes of RAM .	St
1.1.6	So , I got another 256MB stick to make a combination of 512MB .	St
1.1.7	Yet again , the computer will start and then just lock up after about 30 or so minutes of usage .	St
1.1.8	After shutting the computer down , my notebook will not boot back up again .	St
1.1.9	I have to reinstall the RAM in order for my computer to boot up .	St
1.1.10	I 'd really would like to get the performance boost of 512MB , but something in my computer is not letting me .	St
1.1.11	Please Help ! !	St

1.5.2	I believe you have been the only one to reply to my posts - and numerous times as well .	St

1.9.2	After another one of my crashes , I inserted my Ubuntu live CD before forcing a shut down .	St
1.9.3	The computer would not access the harddrive and the Dell splash screen announcing hit F2 to enter set up would not show up on the monitor .	St
1.9.4	Although I did hear the CD drive beginning to spin , but eventually just stopped .	St
1.9.5	When running Ubuntu without a prior crash , it will still freeze after a prolonged period .	St

1.9.7	256 & 256 - Crash 256 & 128 - Crash 256 - Stable 128 & 128 -Stable At this point , I 'm completely perplexed as to what the problem could be .	St

1.13.1	128 and 128 is not working anymore .	St
1.13.2	So I 'm back to running my notebook with just one 256 .	St
1.13.3	This really does not make sense as I have been running 128 and 128 for nearly 4 years .	St
1.13.4	I was trying to think of all possible causes for this problem and came up with a power or driver related issue ?	Ques
1.13.5	I scanned my computer using DriverAgent and according to them , these drivers are out of date : Display adapter IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers 3Com 3C920 Integrated Fast Ethernet Controller ( 3C905C-TX Compatible ) PCMCIA adapters Universal Serial Bus controllers As for the power issue , there are two power adapters for my computer ( Inspiron 2650 ) .

1.13.7	Input is the same at 1.5A .	St
1.13.8	So , any recommendations at this point ?	Ques
