1.1.1	i recently tried to install vcom 's fix-it utilities 6 on my son 's emachine t1100 .	St
1.1.2	after i installed the program i had to do a restart and then i start getting a fatal system error message .	St
1.1.3	he has been having problems with this computer and now he tells me he has had a virus on it for years now , he is not the smartest kid around .	St
1.1.4	i tried to do a microsoft update on it and i ca n't get it to work because it ca n't verify the software installed on the computer as being genuine software , again the virus issue , he said he did something years ago to fix it and i do n't know what he did .	St
1.1.5	he has no idea where the original software is or any recovery disc are .	St
1.1.6	( ask him where his xbox games are and he knows that , lol ) any help is appreciated .	St
1.1.7	i ca n't get it to boot in any mode ( safe mode , normal , etc )	St
1.2.1	This is where you are now .	St
1.2.2	Find the OS CD because its key to the repairs .	St
1.2.3	Sometimes HP and other makers sell the restore CDs which is cheap compared to full retail XP .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	If this system came with XP installed , there 's a good chance as Robert mentioned that the restore CDs can be had from eMachines at a reduced cost vs any new retail OS .	St
1.3.2	You problems are too numerous not to discount a complete re-install .	St
1.3.3	You have to start from scratch and reload the OS , etc .	St
1.3.4	and go from there .	St
1.3.5	You can try to save important data from some pgms. , etc .	St
1.3.6	but if the virus is that bad , you may want to forget that .	St
1.3.7	Instead of using VCom 's pgms .	St
1.3.8	try using the free trail version of SpySweeper and see what it finds .	Sug
1.3.9	Do a pre-check before installing as that 's an option .	St
1.3.10	If none of this works , grab the system and remove it from the kids room for X-days .	St
1.3.11	After X-days the kid ponders maybe I should better handle it when it returns .	St
1.3.12	Oh yeah , I fixed many a kids system and found too much 'undesired stuff ' to seem unintended , good or bad .	St
1.3.13	Last , see if there is a 'hidden partition ' on the HD , that 's the system restore feature .	St
1.3.14	Hope this helps ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
