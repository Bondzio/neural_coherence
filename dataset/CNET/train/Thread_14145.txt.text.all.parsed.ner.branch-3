7864	2	63059	766469	748403	ascent	2/15/05 2:21 pm	1.10847726e12	same experience here	i'm having the same experience, though they responded saying there's been a problem with their email system. i did get an email acknowledgement confirming the order# - though no indication of shipment status. there is no answer to the telephone number - just the same recording saying it is &quot;faster&quot; to contact them by email and then goes on to say that they can/will take no calls. how did your experience resolve? i'm more concerned now having seen your post! please let me know.
