I have a 6 yr old HP pavillion, desktop.
This computer shuts down without warning.
Sometimes I can restart.
Sometimes it won.t restart for hours.
I think its overheating, but cannot proof this ther.
I have opened the case to keep it cooler but it still shuts off.
Some days it does not shut off.
Help
