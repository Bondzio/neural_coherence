<s> Hi there, I have a AM2 system as follows: Asus M2V Mobo 2GB Corsiar DDR2667 RAM in Dual-channel, AMD Athlon X2 4200+ Processor Nvidia GeForce 7300GS Graphics card I am wondering about what to get for my new upgrade: Vista Home Premium, Or a DX10 8600GT graphics card (cause my frame rate are real bad in Oblivion) Thanks in advance Cheers, Kelly </s>
<s> Your choices are real optionable, the OS being the more so. </s>
<s> If you install the video card in with your known healthy psu, you will see benefits. </s>
<s> As for the Prem. </s>
<s> OS, it will only provide some better OS options that has nothing to do with game play, other than DX10(if required). </s>
<s> If you're running Vista now, then expect similar OS results. </s>
<s> You can boost the ram beyond 2gb, IMHO would be better. </s>
<s> For far better or intense deep info, then find a gaming forums, etc. </s>
<s> or modding websites that provide links for same and see what they have to say. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If you get the 8600 video card it well run fine for Windows XP and most of the newer games. </s>
<s> At least until the end of the year. </s>
<s> I assume you want to play games. </s>
<s> The 8600 isn't that great of card. </s>
<s> I would get at least a 8800 320 card if you can. </s>
<s> (I got one). </s>
<s> This would have more long term use. </s>
<s> If you get Vista Home, Then you have a nice new OS, but you wouldn't get the full experince with it. </s>
<s> It probably would run slow anyways and you would regret doing it. </s>
<s> I would get a 8800 320 now (you can find rebates for it all over). </s>
<s> Get ready to build a whole new computer and then get Vista then. </s>
<s> (Build the computer to support vista). </s>
<s> The other guy suggested more RAM. </s>
<s> But you could only go up to like 3.2gb total of ram with 32 bit OS. </s>
<s> So I don't see that being worth it now. </s>
<s> 2GB of RAM is flawless for modern systems, even with Vista, and the rest of your system seems to be decent, I'd go for the graphics card, the 8800 is IN NO WAY required, marketing and nVidia will tell us that you can't game without 8800 SLI, specialist press, years of experience, and other proof will tell us that a 7600GT is easily sufficient for modern games and an 8600GT is even better I'd go with the 8600 for two reasons: A) Vista will slow slow your (any) computer down compared to Windows XP, because Vista uses more resources, not to mention Vista's known issues with, oh, about every software application in the known universe that isn't from Microsoft, and even some that are from Microsoft B) the 8600 will be a large performance jump from your 7300, and will match nicely with your X2 4200 and other hardware (it'll achieve a balance, performance/price wise, which will give you a better experience from the system). </s>
<s> I'd look for the 8600 online, should be able to be had for around $110-$130, other considerations, graphics card wise: Radeon HD 2600Pro Radeon HD 2600XT GeForce 8600GTS they're all in roughly the same performance arena, all DX10, the reason I bring up the Radeons is because of HIS and MSI (board vendors) putting two slot cooling solutions on those boards, while the 8600 series is generally regarded as faster (by a few % here and there) than the HD 2600 series, the HD 2600 series is available with better stock cooling, which is always a plus (and it doesnt add $20-$30 to the price like aftermarket would add to an 8600) </s>
<s> And for what it's worth...whatever $$ you spend on the GPU you can carry forward to a new system...not so with more RAM or better CPU. </s>
<s> Your RIG is OK but weak for gaming because of the GPU. </s>
