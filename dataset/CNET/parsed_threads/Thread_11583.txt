<s> Dear all, I have problem with small Eprom, that can read and write the data, but it has only 2 pins. </s>
<s> Cause the name and mark was earase, so I could not know what is it to find. </s>
<s> It has three pins look like transitor, but using only two pins. </s>
<s> So any body know well about that Eprom can show me where can find it? </s>
<s> Thank so much for instruction. </s>

<s> Your best bet is the maker's manual for technical repairs, shecmatics and such. </s>
<s> Since, you didn't mention even the product, well alot is not known. </s>
<s> I can only assume the eprom is special or rated for certain usage and pins are cut or made w/o them in order to fulfill its mission. </s>
<s> BUT, it maybe a generic(you find one, then clip pins) eprom done in this matter only because the OEM wants it that way. </s>

<s> Read http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2913/ln/en for an example of such a component. </s>
<s> I have such in my ONE WIRE Weatherstation. </s>
<s> ONE WIRE evaluation kits are available from Maxim. </s>

<s> I read this, and I suspect you are talking about the clear Eprom header that a lot of motherboards have. </s>
<s> It is a three pin connector with a jumper that you pull from the one side and put across the other side to clear the EEPROM(To reset the bios EEPROM back to the factory defaults) I may be off base about this, but from your post I am guessing that you are not talking about a special EEPROM like the one wire EEPROM... </s>
<s> If I am wrong, then never mind... </s>
<s> If you are trying to clear your BIOS Eprom, then you need to look in the motherboard manual, or just look at the motherboard and find the 3 pin header with Erase marked next to the pin that is not jumpered. </s>
<s> I think it is one wire Eprom, if you know about it, please show me the equipment that can read and write this. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>

<s> Dear Bob, Thank you so much for showing, Can you tell me where can get Read And Write Equipment for this Eprom? </s>
<s> Yours truly, Le Long </s>
<s> I have the Dallas (now Maxim) One-Wire WS-1 and other items. </s>
<s> I will not give you the exact order page since it's something you can find with google.com, or at Maxim's site. </s>
