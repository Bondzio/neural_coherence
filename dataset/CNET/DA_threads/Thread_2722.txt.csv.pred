1.1.1	I have an AMD Athlon XP 2000 , 512mb ddr 2100 , 450 watt psu , ASUS A7N8X-X mobo .	St
1.1.2	My problem is the cpu is getting way to hot and locking up .	St
1.1.3	I have a fan/heatsink on it but I dont have any of the white goop stuff on it .	St
1.1.4	I have MBM 5 running and it sometime says that the cpu is at 165 degrees F. I know thats hot .	St
1.1.5	Why does it do that when I have a fan/heatsink on it .	St
1.1.6	My fan seems to be fine .	St
1.1.7	Do I need a bigger one because the one I got seems pretty big ?	Ques
1.1.8	Could it be the cpu getting older ?	Ques
1.1.9	I dunno .	Res
1.1.10	thanks for the help !	Polite

1.2.1	thermal compound , between it and the CPU surface .	St
1.2.2	Starting with absolutely clean surfaces , the thermal compound needs to be only a rather thin film .	St
1.2.3	No way is more goop better .	St
1.2.4	If you select a conductive paste then be careful to not get it anywhere but on the actual mating surfaces .	St
1.2.5	It is NOT a squeeze out between the two surfaces process .	St
1.2.6	Keep in mind that the interior ambient air temperature that the HSF is transfering heat to should be only about 12 to 20 F degrees above your room ambient .	St
1.2.7	Therefore cooling the entire interior will also lower CPU temps .	St
1.2.8	Yep Athlons run hot .	St
1.2.9	If it is one that does NOT have the heat spreader to increase the effective surface of the CPU , the heat is being dissipated over about a one square inch surface .	St
1.2.10	Thus the thermal transfer from the CPU to the Heatsink is very critical .	St
1.2.11	Intel has used the heat speader for years .	St
1.2.12	I understand that some of the 32 bit Athlons are now using them .	St
1.2.13	The AMD 64 bitters all use heatspreaders .	St
