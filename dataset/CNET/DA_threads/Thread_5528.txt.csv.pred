1.1.1	I am researching equipment to set up my home network so that I can stream HD video and play PS3 games unline without lag .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone have any recommendations on wireless routers ?	Ques
1.1.3	I want to get the best of the best .	St
1.1.4	So far I am looking at Buffalo AirStation AC1300/N900 Gigabit Dual Band WZR-D1800H .	St
1.1.5	Also , I have been reading up on the USB 2.0 to 3.0 change .	St
1.1.6	Is this transition worth it ?	Ques
1.1.7	For storage I use two Western Digital 1 Terabyte external hardrives .	St
1.1.8	with setting up this new network Im also trying to see what other external hardrives might be better in terms up uploading speed , to support streaming .	St
1.1.9	Basically I am looking to redo my entire network which consist of two WD external Hardrive Terabytes/ 2.0 USB and a Linksys wireless N router from 2006. any recommendations would be great !	St
1.1.10	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I 've yet to see anything short of being at Google HQ to be without lag .	St
1.2.2	It 's more of a matter of your location and internet connection lag ( speed is nice , but lag is not directly related to speed ! )	St
1.2.3	But about your USB 3.0 question .	St
1.2.4	USB 3.0 is nice when it works but if you 've followed the screams you know to not count on that .	St
1.2.5	Here we use USB 2.0 since for the usual work it 's fine .	St
1.2.6	And more than fast enough to play HD content .	St
1.2.7	- & gt ; I read you are setting up a NAS so be sure you do n't over invest in NAS boxes .	St
1.2.8	All the reviews you read seem to dis such on speed .	St
1.2.9	Here we dedicated a netbook as a server and it handily bests most NAS boxes and routers .	St

1.3.1	Location and internet connection even when dealing with internal network streaming ?	Ques
1.3.2	I should probably note that this is an area in which I am still learning , so could you elaborate on this because would have assumed that location and speed should only affect dowloading content .	St
1.3.3	I see your point on the 2.0 to 3.0 transition .	St
1.3.4	from what i have read so far you need 3.0 to 3.0 to work correctly in addition to a 3.0 usb cord to connect the two .	St
1.3.5	I would think that therotically this should help as my network is setup with two external hardrives connecting into my computer .	St
1.3.6	My fix to this would be getting a 2 terabyte 3.0 external hardrive and connecting it with a 3.0 cord into a 3.0 slot on my desktop .	St
1.3.7	I bring all this up as I have a ton of movies in which I hope to stream to my tv via PS3 or Western Digital Live TV box .	St
1.3.8	However , with my corrent set up it lags throughout the movie .	St
1.3.9	This is expected as much of my equipment is outdated and needs updated .	St
1.3.10	thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Location still matters for streaming as what if your ISP has a small pipe to get all it 's subscribers access to Netflix ?	Ques
1.4.2	But it sounds as if SPEED is the issue an not lag .	St
1.4.3	Lag in video games upsets the player as they click the button and the delay means they may not get the shot .	St
1.4.4	SPEED helps when streaming as it keeps the video player 's buffer full .	St
1.4.5	However if you have a member running some torrent then we have to wait for you to realize what cures that one .	Sug
1.4.6	There 's also better streamers and apps .	St
1.4.7	I 'm beginning to see the makers & quot ; get a clue & quot ; today as my Kindle Fire HD can download a movie in advance of the time I want to play it .	St
1.4.8	This means I am not as subject to speed issues as its buffer is huge .	St
1.4.9	Let 's hope more streaming players are increasing those buffers .	St
