Used for USB 2.0 to SATA/IDE connections. This adapter will allow you to access the old laptop drive and many others should the need arise. Pricing is decent and is far more flexible than a simple USB case, though that will work. good luck tada -----Willy

I think the suggestions above are good, but... If the reason the laptop went for repairs was a faulty hard drive, you may need more heroic measures for data recovery (which are never described as inexpensive). I'm inferring there's useful data that aren't backed up? If it's just your applications and configuration you want restored, you'll be quicker and better to start from scratch.

How do I get past it? I have the username and password the files were created under, but don't know where to enter them.
