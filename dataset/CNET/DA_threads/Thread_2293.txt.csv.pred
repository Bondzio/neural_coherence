1.1.1	they can't be found in windows explorer OR disk manager.	St
1.1.2	when i plug in my flash drive to one, it lights up and my computer makes the &quot;ba-dump!&quot; nice like it knows it got plugged in.	St
1.1.3	the light on my flash drive turns on at first but turns off right away, like the computer isn't reading the drive.	St
1.1.4	i tried plugging in my mp3 player, and i got the same response.	St
1.1.5	it charged my player, but it didn't read it.	St
1.1.6	please help.	Sug
1.1.7	anything i missed feel free to ask.	St
1.2.1	do you mean USB ports (the female connector on the computer) or USB flash drives?	St
1.2.2	the two are very different things If it has power, it should be working, given that the internal headers can only connect one way and provide power (and therefore a working signal) So I'd vote for software problem or system board oddity (as in, low quality connectors, or something similar)	St
1.3.1	the female connector.	St
1.3.2	my flash drives work fine (i've tested on other computers).	St
1.3.3	if its software is there anyway to fix it?	St
1.4.1	I'd go for reinstalling the USB device's drivers (should be on the mainboard CD), see if that helps out any Are you getting &quot;insufficient power from USB hub&quot; errors at all?	St
1.5.1	no, but i do get messages that tey aren't high-speed ports, which isn't true.	St
1.5.2	possibly they aren't getting enough power?	St
1.5.3	where do you get the drivers?	St
1.5.4	i'm unclear on what the mainboard cd is.	St
1.5.5	do you mean the cd for the operating system?	Ques
1.6.1	It probably is the driver.	St
1.6.2	Try to searching for the manufacture of your motherboard on google.	St
1.6.3	Once you found it, they should have all your drivers there, download the USB controller driver.	St
1.7.1	this is the mother board: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00257657&cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=436879&dlc=en&lang=en these are the drivers available for downloads.	St
1.7.2	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=436879&lang=en unless im going blind, there's no drivers for the usb hubs to download.	St
1.7.3	anywhere else to look?	St
