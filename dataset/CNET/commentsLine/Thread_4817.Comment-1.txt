hello first of all i would like to apologize if mu questions seem silly.
i have been into computers for a long time, but now that winter break is coming and i have some time to play games, i am ready to upgrade my computer.
i just bought a 24inch monitor and would like a video card that would make it look pretty.
first of all, this is the computer that i have - sony vaio vgc-rb30, with following specs listed on this website:  i did upgrade my memory, i have 1.5 gigs.
i also have a geforce pci card in there but its kind of old (512mb, i believe its 6800).
i was looking to upgrade it to either geforce 8800 gtx, radeon 4850 or geforce 9800 gtx.
i do not know if my power supply would allow for those and if it does not, what are my options.
also, with my previous radeon card, i had problem of overheating.
i think my tower does not have good cooling system.
i did install two extra fans, but one went dead so when i play i have to place an outside (big home fan) by the computer.
i would also like to purchase a video card that i could transfer to a new computer when i have money to buy it.
for right now though i just want an upgrade.
please, let me know what i should do!
thanks
