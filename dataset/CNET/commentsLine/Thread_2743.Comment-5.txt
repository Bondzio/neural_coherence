last question, what is the best way of avoiding the conflict between the two vga adapters ?
ofocurse i want to use my agp not the nf2 inbuilt one.
i have my monitor plugged into my radeon 9600xt vga, thought now that i can't install the drivers for it, both vga&quot;s are with question marks next to them without any actual info on which one's which.
so i am not sure which one to disable.
