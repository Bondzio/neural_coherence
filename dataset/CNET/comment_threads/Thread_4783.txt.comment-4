So based on the monitor I'm looking at.
The only time I can see black bars on the edges is if I set the monitor to 4:3 mode.
That's just an adjustment with the monitor controls.....4:3 or full screen.
Vid card res.....on this machine if I right click a blank area of the desktop and select properties/settings I see a slider to select screen res.
Best to set it to monitor native res.
