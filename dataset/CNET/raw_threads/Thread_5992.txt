Right now, can get that Envision for 100. $$ at local Staples. Yes, I'm sure it is obsolete, Does anyone have one, Do you like it??

At $100, if it lasts 3yrs. you got your money's worth, but generally you may or may not have a problem under typical use. If you can afford more, get a better monitor, even a LCD is better if a cheap one than a CRT type. Check Wal-Mart as a source or online from them to get an idea of pricing. You can visit other office outlet stores or wait for a sale as this is the time for sales or close outs. tada -----Willy

Maybe the text on that screen is not all that different from what I now have. (A 5 or 6 year old Compaq V70) Maybe that price is not all that much bargin. I'll look around some more. Thanks for reply..

Army or Goodwill shop and find a decent used major brands, old monitor but a working one. In most cases, you can return a bad monitor back within 72hrs. at least at Goodwill. Yes, I do find 19/17/15in. more(15) often and they do well for me to provide to the less fortunate as an overall system on the cheap minus the OS. Just though I mention that as a source for used monitors as they go for $15 or less. tada -----Willy
