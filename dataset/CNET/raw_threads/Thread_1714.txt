10783	1	174335	1917338	1917238	justanothernoob	5/4/06 10:53 PM	1.14678318E12	well	the 7900 GT of course but not by much but in the end both are great cards and will get you playing todays top games. Nick

I wouldn't get either of those tow, because I would wait for Windows Vista and Direct X 10 to come out later this year or two. Once Direct X 10 comes out, the current high end graphic cards are going to become obsolete, and you're not gonna play the games the way that it's meant to be played...

10783	5	174335	1919293	1918927	Morgalu	5/5/06 5:31 PM	1.14685026E12	that cant be true	bigger isnt necessarily better. the 7900's are based on 90-nanometer die size, so its physically smaller than the 7800's. so is everyone confirming the 7900gt is better than not only the 7800gt, but 7800gtx as well?
10783	6	174335	1919922	1919293	nathanpsz2	5/6/06 4:43 AM	1.14689058E12	I was just making a joke...	...the 7900GT performs as well or better than the 7800GTX. I already knew about the die shrink; I was just trying to sound like some of the n00bs on these forums.

In a market like computer hardware, there are constant advances and waiting for the next big thing would mean complete and unending paralysis. If you already have a fairly good card and you're a patient person, by all means, wait. But if your current set-up is keeping you from playing the games that you want to play (or keeping you from running them the way that you'd like 'em to run) go get what you want. Don't wait a year or two.

It's almost over for the Cirect X 9 era, and in a blink of an eye, Direct X 10 comes out, and all the games would look entirely different, so just save your money and hold on to your patience because some killer graphics cards are on their way...

DX1138	The way graphics cards are advancing, ANY card is going to be bettered in less than a year, meaning that it's &quot;State of the Art&quot; lifespan is going to be less than a year no matter when you buy. Unless you're still living on an allowance, why wait a year to buy something that you'll probably upgrade within a year after you buy it anyway?
10783	11	174335	1920965	1920667	agentsanderson	5/6/06 7:47 PM	1.14694482E12	Most games released right after Vista will be DX10/9 able	First of all the guy saying Dx9 is reaching its end, bla bla bla hasn't been doing alot of reading. I agree with WhyFi. First of Vista is scheduled to be released in January, and is the only operating system that will utilize DX10. After vista is released gaming developers are not going to start making DX10 exclusive games immedietly. Games released will be both Dx10/9 compatible for quite a while until developers are sure that the majority of consumers use Vista and DX10 PC's and they will not be losing any profit because Dx10 is not widely used at the time. This has already been confirmed in games like Crysis, if you haven't heard of it just use google. Crysis is a new game set to be released under DX9/10 after Vista's release. The screens you've seen of this game were all taken using DX9 hardware. The developer stated that Crysis on Dx9 would look 3 generations better than Far Cry, and that the Dx10 version would look only 1 generation better than the DX9 version. Unreal Tournament 07 us also a DX9/10 game as gameplay was shown using a DX9 card. The simple fact is that all users are not going to switch to Vista as soon as it debuts. It takes time for people to make the switch. Game developers know this. The same thing happened when Dx9 was released, It took quite a while for developers to switch to DX9 exclusive titles. As you can see games like HL2, even Cod 2 are DX 7, and DX 8 compatible. Theres no such thing as future proofing a PC, It would be stupid to run out and buy the first Dx10 card on the market. the price would certainly be high, but within a few monthes newer Dx10 cards with better performance would be released. And what you bought would start to struggle in new games after a while, forcing you to upgrade. When Dx9 came out people rushed to get 6800 Ultras, Gt's, even the 7800GTX. All these cards were $500+ at their time of debut. Now look, the 6800 line of cards can't handle most games out on high settings. (Fear, Oblivion, COD2,AOE3, etc). There are people that bought the 7800GTX for $550. Now the 7900GT which is slightly better is selling at $289. Remember you will always be forced to upgrade hardware, as new games that will be too much for the current GPU's will always come out. ATI, and Nvidia will release tons of DX10 cards, with each one being better than teh last and having new features.

It has 24 pxel pipelines compared to the 7800GT's 20, it also has higher clockspeeds. Now on to the 7800GTX. The 7900GT performs better than the 7800GTX. They both have the same number of pixel pipelines, but due to the shrinked die of the 7900GT, speeds have increased and this offer a 5-7% performance boost over the 7800GTX. The 7900GT runs cooler, is quiter, and hase far better overclockability due to the die shrinkage. The 7900GT when overclocked will increase teh performance over the 7800GTX by quite a margin, even though not that much. Higher clock speeds are the reason for this. In simple terms the 7900GT is better at stock speeds than both the 7800GTX and 7800GT. Its also cheap, and prices are as low as $289 now.
