Intended for Notebooks/Laptops, are these external HDs suitable for use with a Desktop ? They seem to work well. There are 3.5&quot; models intended for the Desktop and these are powered off the wall socket. I suppose these can be used for Notebooks/Laptops as well. These external cases seems interchangeable for Laptop and Desktop. Since both are being produced and sold, should a 2.5&quot; case only be used for Laptops and 3.5&quot; for Desktops only ? What are the pros and cons of using these external drives for Desktops and laptops, apart from size and power source (portability) ? Are there any other considerations, e.g. safety (data loss, heat/fire, ) for chosing one over the other ? Thanks. christy

If your laptop is very low on battery power, there may be a problem during data transfer (loss of data), unless you are using a &quot;powered USB hub&quot;, or you are using power off a wall socket.
