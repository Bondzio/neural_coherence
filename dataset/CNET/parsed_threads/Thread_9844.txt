<s> I took my Netgear WGR614v10 back to Walmart and exchanged it for a WNR2000v2. </s>
<s> I find out after I got home that not only is it not windows 7 certified but its not certified for xbox either. </s>
<s> It seems to be working better than the old router on the laptop but when I test my 360 connection I get a moderate NAT warning. </s>
<s> I have followed all the steps listed on the xbox support. </s>
<s> I have forwarded port, set xbox as the DMz. </s>
<s> I don't know what else to do. </s>
<s> The connection seems to be some better but I can't get the NAT changed to open. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on what to do or should I just give it up and order a wireless modem from my ISP and pay $4.00 every month? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> We have that router. </s>
<s> But. </s>
<s> (What?) </s>
<s> Ours is setup like this forum suggests as to latest firmware and the rest of the suggested settings. </s>
<s> I didn't have to open ports, forward, touch anything NAT. </s>
<s> It just works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If I plug the 360 straight into the modem it reads an open NAT; but that's from where I had to reconfigure it before with the old router. </s>
<s> I plugged the new router in and that's when it read a moderate NAT. </s>
<s> Here I did nothing. </s>
<s> Or very little. </s>
<s> I did exactly what this forum asked. </s>
<s> Lastest firmware, router defaults, and WPA-PSK for wifi security and a simple broadcasting SSID. </s>
<s> Your post sounds like you are trying many interesting things. </s>
<s> I'm glad my 2000 just works with the 360 without touching any setting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I reset the modem to factory defaults and tried it again and got the same results. </s>
<s> Still a moderate NAT. </s>
<s> I thought maybe the issue was the fact the router isn't certified for the xbox but if you have no issues then that's probably not it. </s>
<s> I tried to upgrade to the latest firmware and it said none was available. </s>
<s> I went to the router maker's web site since those router web interfaces are not reliable. </s>
<s> Ok, maybe I'm missing something. </s>
<s> Both our 360s work with live fine. </s>
<s> But you keep writing moderate NAT. </s>
<s> Is there more to this story? </s>
<s> That is, are you attempting something other than Live? </s>
<s> It will be a few weeks until I get back to home (on travel today) to see what firmware I have in our 2000 router but here, the stock settings and the forum advice works. </s>
<s> Parting idea. </s>
<s> See if you can put the xbox 360 into the DMZ. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just purchased this router and was having a problem connecting xbox live via my laptop. </s>
<s> Try the following to resolve your problem. </s>
<s> 1) Go to the &quot;router login&quot; 2) Click on &quot;WAN Setup&quot; 3) uncheck the box labeled as &quot;NAT Filtering&quot; </s>
<s> I meant uncheck the box &quot;Disable SIP ALG&quot; then check the box &quot;OPEN&quot; </s>
<s> Yes you may set the NAT filtering to &quot;open&quot;, Disable the firewall and also you may lower the MTU size to 1400 and if non of these steps work advise to upgrade the firmware of the router. </s>
<s> I had three diff routers before this one. </s>
<s> I did the DMZ open prt forwarding ALL the things forums said, and nothing helped! </s>
<s> The NETGEAR WNR2000v2 has to the best router ever for MWCOD,and black ops and any xbox 360 game! </s>
<s> All I did was plug it up and it ran! </s>
<s> Open NAT every time, no configuration, It even saw the gateway without cofiguration. </s>
<s> It has a good range as well on the wireless. </s>
<s> If your fighting the open NAT like I was, You will love this router! </s>
<s> i have the same NETGEAR WNR2000v2 router and ive tried everything and still get &quot;nat type moderate&quot; its really pissing me off think we should just throw the thing away and buy a belkin router i had one while i lived in England and ive never ever had any problems with it </s>
<s> potwillams try this as i have the same router. </s>
<s> go to your router setup for net gear its 192.168.1.1 or routerlogin.net then go to WAN setup and make sue that NAT filtering is on open. </s>
<s> secured will give you moderate or restricted. </s>
