1.)
Upgrade 'firmware' in router if you haven't already and if Sony notebook has 'card' or internal wireless upgrade it's 'firmware' also!
2.)
Is the Sony located in the vicinity of a telephone that uses 2.4Ghz carrier?
I experienced a similar intermittent operation and it was fixed by removing the phone completely.
3.)
In 'Network Connections', 'Wireless network Connections Properties'(Get to via right click), 'Wireless Networks' be sure &quot;Use Windows to configure my wireless netowrk settings&quot; is checked!!
