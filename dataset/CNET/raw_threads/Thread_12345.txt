I have uninstalled the printer several times, I have reinstalled various versions of the printer driver. Whenever I print to this printer I get Windows Installer popping up wanting to install a feature that is not available. It wants &quot;G:\ Market Research&quot;. My Logical Disk Management has changed the disk &quot;Letters&quot; so G: no longer exists. If I &quot;cancel&quot; the request twice the printer continues and prints. I have tried various things and I do not want to reformat the HDD for this annoyance.
