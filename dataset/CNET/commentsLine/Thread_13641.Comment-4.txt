my understanding of the description -- not getting to bios at all, i.e.
failing to post even.
if that's true, then the problem is hardware, not the os.
strip down (unplug everything except 1 stick of ram, cpu, psu, and video) and test the usual culprits.
if needed, the motherboard should have a couple pins you jumper together to reset the cmos or something similar to get back to default bios.
no disrespect intended, but might get better help from a forum in one's native language.
