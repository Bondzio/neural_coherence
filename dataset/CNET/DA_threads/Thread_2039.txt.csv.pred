1.1.1	Hey, I'm new here and I need some help.	St
1.1.2	My brothers old Dell didn't have a burner in it, so he bought one and had it installed, years later, I inherited the computer, tore it apart and used some components in my own system, the CD-rw being my main drive.	St
1.1.3	Worked perfect, up until I installed a DVD player into the system, the DVD cd-rom works fine, however whenever I put a CD into the Sony CD-RW, my system freezes until I remove it, or crashes/loacks up altogether.	St
1.1.4	I have two IDE cables in use.	St
1.1.5	My system specs are 80 gig WD HD AMD Athlon 64 3500+ MSI neo2 platinum Mobo Sapphire Radeon 9800 pro Sound blaster Audigy Coolmax taurus 450 watt PSU Any help would be appreciated, it'd be nice to be able to burn again.	Ques
