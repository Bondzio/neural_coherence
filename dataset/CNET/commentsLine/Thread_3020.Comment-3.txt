i switched cables and still have a &quot;network cable unplugged&quot; message.
the port connected to new computer does work when connected to the original computer so the port does not seem to be the problem.
this connection has worked perfectly with my old dell.
i only replaced towers, no cables or other items.
i just can't find a cure.
