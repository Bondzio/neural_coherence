I just think that as a moderator (and I speak from experience, having been a mod here in the past), it's important to foster an environment in which people feel they can come here to get help, not get reprimanded or told &quot;No&quot; when they ask a perfectly reasonable question.
Yes, I found some information doing a forum search but not much, and what I found expressed opinions on both sides of the &quot;WPA or WPA2&quot; question.
In fact one of the pro-WPA2 posts was yours.
I found more information elsewhere without being chastised for asking for it, and I think I'm closer to a solution than I was this morning.
Have a good weekend.
