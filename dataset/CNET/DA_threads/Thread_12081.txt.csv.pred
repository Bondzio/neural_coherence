1.1.1	Does anyone know a good wireless-g router (MIMO would be nice) that also serves a printer?	St
1.1.2	I've seen a bunch with USB ports in the rear, does this enable storage/printserve capability?	St
1.1.3	Thanks.	St

1.2.2	Why must it be in the router?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	My main goal is simplicity for the network.	St
1.3.2	I know for a fact that routers with print serve functionality exist...there's an ASUS joint that has NAS built in, print server and a host of other goodies, but it didn't get a very good review.	St
1.4.1	I've found all in ones to be more problematic.	St
1.4.2	Maybe this has changed but I like repeating what works.	St
