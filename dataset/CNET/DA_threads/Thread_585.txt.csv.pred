1.1.1	Hello all , my brother has just bought and installed a pc memory stick that gives me around 75GB extra memory .	St
1.1.2	I have no idea about the internal workings of a pc so he bought and installed the stick for me .	St
1.1.3	He has told me that the stick has been installed properly .	St
1.1.4	How can I access that new memory from my pc ?	Ques
1.1.5	Does the stick automatcally create a new disk drive in 'My Coputer ? '	Ques
1.1.6	Where can I find the memory stick memory information on Windows xp ?	Ques
1.1.7	How do I save things to the stick instead of the my harddrive ?	Ques
1.2.1	To be sure it is installed properly , your brother must have tried it , so it seems logical to me he showed you that it worked correctly and how to use it .	St
1.2.2	I assume it is n't a flash drive , but something with a ( rather large ) hard disk inside .	St
1.2.3	And I assume it 's just a drive letter ( maybe d : , maybe g : ) in My Computer .	St
1.2.4	So saving or moving anything to it can be done by selecting the g : -drive in stead of the c : -drive .	St
1.2.5	And you can move or copy anything to it using My Computer or Windows Explorer like you copy or move to any other drive .	St
1.2.6	Hope this helps .	St

1.3.1	Hello again , my brother is on vacation for two weeks and I have no way of contacting him .	St
1.3.2	I have no idea what type of memory stick he used or what brand , I do n't even have the manual .	St
1.3.3	I have just checked My Computer and there is no new driver listed .	St
1.3.4	Has anybody got any ideas ?	Ques
1.3.5	Has it installed correctly ?	Ques

1.4.1	I 'm afraid it is impossible to say more about it with the information you give .	St
1.4.2	It might even be a second internal hard disk in stead of an external device .	St
1.4.3	And it might be , for example , that it still has to be partitioned and formatted using Disk Management .	St
1.4.4	That should be in the manual .	St
1.4.5	Nothing much to do but wait till your brother returns .	St
1.4.6	Or bring it to a local shop and let them fix it .	St
1.4.7	If they see it , they will know what to do with it to get it up and running .	St
1.4.8	Kees	St
1.5.1	The info you have given us is rather confusing .	St
1.5.2	You keep referring to a memory stick , also known as RAM or random access memory which ( very briefly ) only increases the working area for running programs and other functions it is not for storage .	St
1.5.3	so my question is did he install extra RAM or an internal hard drive .	St
1.5.4	do you see any components outside the computer like sitting on the desktop somewhere with wires going to the computer .	St
1.5.5	If not he installed an extra Hard drive internally .	St
1.5.6	right click MY Computer and click Manage .	St
1.5.7	On The windows that opens click Disk management and see if there is a new drive there .	St
1.5.8	Right click the drive and click initiate .	St
1.5.9	when that is done you will need to format the drive .	St
1.6.1	Hello again , there is no new external hard drive sitting anywhere on my pc .	St
1.6.2	I have just tried the 'Manage ' option on My Computer and it only lists my original c hard drive and dvd player .	St
1.6.3	It looks like I will have to wait for my brother to come home .	St

1.7.1	Hello again , I have just solved the problem !	St
1.7.2	My brother actually installed an updated graphics card that came with its own memory .	St
1.7.3	That 's why I could not find any new hard drive info on my pc .	St
1.7.4	Thanks for all the help Shane	St
1.8.1	That 's a pretty interesting discovery .	Polite
1.8.2	The Larger video card will not give you any extra storage space but it should give you a little better performance for video functions .	St
