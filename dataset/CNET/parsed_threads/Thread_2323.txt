<s> Both of the ATi variety. </s>
<s> My assessment of the issue from what I've seen is that for some reason the drivers for both of my graphics cards can't be installed at the same time. </s>
<s> Some sort of conflict. </s>
<s> I can get each card's drivers installed and working great, so I know both cards do work. </s>
<s> However, soon as I install the drivers for the second card, I get a blue screen and have to roll back to a system restore point. </s>
<s> I'm sure I have the correct drivers for each card. </s>

<s> I've used Driver Sweeper after each failed attempt to wipe the slate clean and try again. </s>
<s> But no go. </s>
<s> One of the things I run into is when I have the PCI's drivers installed and restart and proceed to install the AGP's, I get asked if I want to replace system32's &quot;ati2evxx.exe&quot; and &quot;ati2evxx.dll&quot; files with the two new ones from the source install. </s>

<s> It probably would be a problem solved if I changed my graphics cards to two more modern ones that were somewhat guaranteed to work together to create a three monitor setup. </s>
<s> I wish I could. </s>
<s> I'm positive that there is a specific answer to the specific problem I'm facing with these ATi cards. </s>

<s> I know that you wish that someone would tell you to run driver version 10.2 but no one seems to know that. </s>

<s> Sometimes it sucks all the creativity out of finding a solution. </s>
<s> That said, I've been thinking that it may be a good idea to pick up a late model dual video PCI card and add that to my system along side the dual DVI AGP card. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, I'll return the new PCI card to the store and forget I ever hatched this tri-monitor egg. </s>
