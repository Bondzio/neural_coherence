Hey I hope this will help...
I actually did the same thing the other day.
1) Remove the Power supply 2) Unscrew the back screws and the side ones going into the metal panel.
3) Flip back the system board and then the side panel should be exposed.
I had to install a CD-burner the other day in one of these machines.
Good Luck.. Ray.
