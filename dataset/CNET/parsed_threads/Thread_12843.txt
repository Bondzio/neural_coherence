<s> I'm having a problem whenever I try to use a wireless mouse with my MSI Wind netbook (a re-badged version, the Advent 4211). </s>
<s> The computer seems to have great difficulty recognising the USB mini-receivers for Logitech wireless mice. </s>
<s> Their presence doesn't register at all for quite a while and then the 'found new hardware' wizard kicks in and asks me to install the appropriate software drivers. </s>
<s> As soon as I think that's sorted, up pops the new hardware wizard again and makes go through the same routine again. </s>
<s> Repeatedly. </s>
<s> Eventually it settles down and the mouse works okay ... until I switch off the machine and come back to use it later. </s>
<s> Then we're back to the new hardware routine all over again. </s>
<s> I'm experiencing the same issue with a variety of Logitech wireless mice, including the VX Nano, VX Revolution and the Trackman Optical. </s>
<s> I've tried using these mice both with Logitech's own software installed and without (which I'd prefer as I don't need the extra functions). </s>
<s> It's the same situation with all three USB ports on the computer. </s>
<s> All three ports work fine with other hardware connected. </s>
<s> My computer's operating system is Windows XP SP3. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest a potential fix for this problem? </s>

<s> The Logitech V450 Nano and it's USB device works fine from Windows 2000, XP and Vista laptops. </s>
<s> You were not specific but I'll share my success. </s>
