Im wondering why the heck when i play demos like far cry, and the new medal of honor it runs so crappy. the new medal of honor demo, i ran at 1024 by 768 and it was all sluggish. Im wondering if i would need 1 gig of ram, or maybe its my power supply, which is only 350 watts. Any help? Do i just need to turn my settings down?

But I find most don't update motherboard and video drivers from the makers web sites. You didn't write how you deal with drivers. Microsoft surely doesn't do this for us. Best of luck and try keeping the pests out. Bob
