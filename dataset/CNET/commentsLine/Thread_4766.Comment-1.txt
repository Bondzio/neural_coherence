windows xp home w/sp2 - asus a8v - 256 ram - athlon cpu i added a new 160gb internal sata hard drive.
i enabled the sata boot rom in the bios and re-booted.
when the opening screens are flashing by, i see the drive has been detected and is listed.
but when windows comes up and i click on my computer, it is not listed.
what am i missing?
