I made no changes or additions to what is plugged in the drives. Whenever I plug in the drive I get &quot;this drive could perform faster&quot; (which never happened before) When I go to load a new large file onto my usb drive/portable hd, ect. i get 1 mb/sec (at most). Any port I try it in, I get the same speed. Any ideas? Solutions?

As there is no make or model we can't discuss ideas on where the right drivers might be. This leaves the advice to use System Restore to the time before &quot;sudden.&quot; Bob

As to the cause, the cause continues to be that Windows Update and accepting drivers most of the time. If that's some HP, check HP for motherboard drivers to install and hope. Bob
