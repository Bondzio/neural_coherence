Yes, you are right.
Total Recovery Pro( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) has a function called Offsite copy can help you avoid disasters of local site.
The function uses FTP to upload your backup images to remote FTP site; so you can get back your data from that site.
Another way is using Online Backup.
Online Backup will backup files/folders to Internet, but it may take you some money by calculating the data size.
