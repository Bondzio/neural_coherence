I used the wizzard to set up a network and can get connectivity but the slave wants to use the modem to dial up instead of seeing the network? I get the icon network connected. Do i need to disable the modem on the slave? what am i doing wrong here? Jerry thanks

So I assume you set up the Internet Connection sharing and etc already. Did you also go into your Internet Explorer &quot;Options&quot; and change your &quot;Connection&quot; settings on your &quot;slave&quot; machine? If not, go into your Internet &quot;Properties&quot; and under the &quot;Connections&quot; tab there should be some radio buttons. Select the one that says &quot;Never dial a connection.&quot; This should disable the modem. If your connection does not work after this, you may want to try to &quot;Setup&quot; your connection again. And when you do this choose the option to use your LAN connection. The wizard should walk you through it.
