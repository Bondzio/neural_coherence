Lots of useful information.
Since problem seemed to have solved itself (I can't believe I've had anything to do with it), I'm going to save your post to a text file in my Fix & Clean Computer file for future reference.
Very good to have.
Strangely(?
), I don't have an &quot;auto detect&quot; or &quot;Automatic&quot; offered in the drop down list of options ONLY &quot;auto-negotiate&quot; (probably a cheap import from Compaq used by HP since the take over).
Sorry about that: The HP is Model &quot;DV1010CA&quot;.
Canadian specific model.
Guess my eyes were overly tired or I'm just going blind (either is equally likely!).
Thanks again for the help!
