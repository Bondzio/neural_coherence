with the failure of the first drive Like I said before ..... he bad news about RAID 0 is and I quote....&quot;The failure of just one drive will result in all data in an array being lost.&quot; You indicated one drive died and you restored the OS to the working drive.
Sorry for the bad news ...perhaps someone else will see a solution I missed.
