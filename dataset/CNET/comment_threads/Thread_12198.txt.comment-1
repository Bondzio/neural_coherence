Can anyone please point me in the direction of a free, downloadable computer glossary?
I haven't searched Google yet because I think I'll end up with a lot of search returns.
So I figured I'd ask here first to get some &quot;vetted answers&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.
Thanks for any help.
I need this to start reading myself into the topics to better help prepare some basic training in this and related subjects.
If such a glossary exists online, it'd be okay, too.
However, downloadable would make it easier to work with.
Thanks.
