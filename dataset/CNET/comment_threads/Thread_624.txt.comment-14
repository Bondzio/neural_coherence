Get a decent P35 motherboard that will properly support the 45nm e8400-e8500 processors.
If you just have to have an SLI motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45NM like this board here http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131232 A good Intel board with a single 16x PCIe slot Gigabyte (GIGABYTE GA-EP35-DS3L) will do the trick.
