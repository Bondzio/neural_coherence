and the q6600's replacement penryn chip will be about 10% faster at the same speed so phenom will be 15-20% off the pace by march '08.
phenom production can barely hit 2.8ghz, while core2quad was at 3+ ghz in its prior generation.
(even q6600s oc easily to 3.2ghz.)
sorry, but phenom has no chance of being the best high-end processor.
