I listen to college radio (the ones that stream @ 128k), mostly, and cd's. Thanks.

You can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future. Speakers like the Cambridge SoundWorks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound.

I purchased Ev Sonic Xs THe tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them. With a 120 watt Subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong. 240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150. But Bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound. I have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power.
