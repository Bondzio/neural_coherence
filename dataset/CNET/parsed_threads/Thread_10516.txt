<s> I'm running a HP Pavilion g6 laptop Windown 7 Linksys WRT54GS router Windstream speedstream modem Lately my laptop won't go online with wifi. </s>
<s> It says, &quot;no internet access.&quot; This is confusing, because I can hard wire it to my modem and it works okay, so it is not the ISP. </s>
<s> But, we have another computer and sometimes it will work on there, and we have a Roku and it works on there sometimes. </s>
<s> So, this is not consistant. </s>
<s> Today I went to Linksys and downloaded the latest firmware update and installed that. </s>
<s> I still have the same problem. </s>
<s> --- &quot;no internet access.&quot; Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks, I'm going bananas! </s>
<s> If the router is set to WEP, that happens a lot. </s>
<s> I no longer will discuss why that is. </s>
<s> Try WPA or WPA2 next. </s>

<s> so, that isn't the problem. </s>
<s> However, this afternoon when I felt really desperate I found the CD that came with the router and ran it to set it up again. </s>
<s> At first it didn't work, then I ran the troubleshooting part and after a few things it began to work again. </s>
<s> I'm so happy right now you wouldn't believe it. </s>
<s> I've spent all day on this stupid thing. </s>
<s> So, thanks for your help, and if I get stuck again I'll be back. </s>
<s> Blessings. </s>
<s> Any MAC FILTERING? </s>
<s> I can't guess all that it could be, so we start with the most common and hope there are more clues. </s>
