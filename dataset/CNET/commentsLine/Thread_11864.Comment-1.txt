i moved one of two computers to another room not wired for computer internet.
i purchased and installed a netgear wireless router.
i connected my dsl modem via connector-cable to the netgear wireless router.
one hardwire connection was made to a regularly used computer nearest the router.
my remote computer has a mating netgear pc-wireless card attached and everything works with one exception.
that exception is that the hardwired computer (nearest the wireless router) for some reason needs to be on and online in order for the remote computer to actually have an internet connection.
my question is, &quot;if i connect the dsl modem to a hardwired router with one connection for my computer and then one connection to the wireless router would the remote computer have internet access without having a host computer power on and online?&quot; my intention was to have the remote computer have the capability of achieving a real wireless connection to the internet without any other computer running.
any suggestions would be appreciated!
