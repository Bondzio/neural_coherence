The desktop is a Dell, running on XP, the modem is a Verizon issues Westell, the Router is a Linksys.
The desktop PC uses a USB hub to connect it to the b/w Canon printer as well as a Scanner and an external hard drive.
I'm hoping that being a little more specific about what kind of equipment I already have helps you help me?!
?
