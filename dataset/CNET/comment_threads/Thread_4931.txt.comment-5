Assume you have a computer with PCI-Express technology as the PCI-Express x300 will not fit in a computer with AGP unless it has one of the rare new special VIA chipsets.
The Radeon 9200 & 9200se cards are AGP and will not fit your PCI-Express computer.
You would not want a regular PCI card if you have a PCI-Express x-16 slot for a video card.
Yes, the PCI-express x300 card will play the game you indicate, and most high end games at a low level setting, and will do video editing, movies, etc.
There is hardly any difference in the x300 and x600 in most gaming.
If you have $200 to spare, I would suggest the Nvidia PCI-Express x-16 version of the 6600GT for $180 or the AGP version of the 6600GT for $189.
If you want to stay under $100 the Nvidia PCI-Express Geforce 6200 for $93(not the cheaper 6200TC) will generally out perform the Radeon X300 and X600 in gaming and other areas.
