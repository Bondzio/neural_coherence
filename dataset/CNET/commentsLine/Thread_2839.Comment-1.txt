this may not be an easy question to answer with the information i can provide, but this is the jist of the problem: i recently purchased a new motherboard/cpu package and put the system together myself.
everything appears to be hooked-up correctly.. when i turn on the power all the hardware kicks in and i am given the option to either press ''delete'' to go into the bios menu or ''tab'' to continue.
the issue is that no matter which i press, in about 10-25 seconds thereafter the system simply shuts itself off.
what bugs me the most about this error is that the timing of the shut downs is inconsistent.
sometimes the computer will stay on for 2 minutes, other times it will shut down before the monitor can even refresh the image after booting-up.
is this a hardware or software problem?
