1.1.1	I have an WD 80 GB hd and only 74 GB IDE is useable.	St
1.1.2	When reformatting and partitioning, can the 6 GB be reclaimed?	St
1.1.3	Thanks Ben	St
1.2.1	Keep in mind that the drive is 80 billion bytes and not 80 gigabytes.	St
1.2.2	Let's convert that 74 GB to billions and see what we get?	St
1.2.3	1 GB = 1,073,741,824 so 74 time 1,073,741,824 is... 79,456,894,976 bytes or very close to the drives capacity.	St
1.2.4	The remaining &quot;loss&quot; could be some fraction you didn't note or space consumed by the format which is correct.	St
1.2.5	There.	St
1.2.6	We've reclaimed the missing space.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Are you sure that you aren't getting 6 GB lost by converting from bytes to Gigabytes?	St
1.3.2	If 1024 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte, 1024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte, and 1024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte, then 1,073,741,824 bytes = 1 Gigabyte and so, 80,000,000,000 bytes = 74.50580596923828125 GB which is where you are getting 74 GB from as I have a couple machines with similar drives.	St
1.3.3	Regards, JB	St
1.4.1	CP / Disk Management shows &quot;C&quot; with 34.18 GB NTFS, and &quot;D&quot; with 40.34 GB NTFS (both show healthy) Note, this is in GB, referring to an 80 GB drive.	St
1.4.2	I think I found the answer on Google.	St
1.4.3	Following taken from Google hit... &quot;Because your system reserves 5% for root.	St
1.4.4	Even when the filesystem is full there is some space to root fix the things.	St
1.4.5	This extra space can be used only by root.&quot; Thanks Ben p.s.	St
1.4.6	Just curious... could the 5% space be recovered if wanted?	St
1.4.7	?	Ques
1.5.1	It's an 80 billion byte drive.	St
1.5.2	Tell me the make and model number of the drive so we can confirm that.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Belarc advisor shows WCD WD800JB-00JJC0 (80.02 GB) Ben	St
1.7.1	http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/products.asp?DriveID=32 Look closely at User Sectors Per Drive	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Googling Western Digital on another subject, I found this.	St
1.9.2	http://www.winxpfix.com/NEWS/06-28-06/Western-Digital-settles-capacity-dispute.htm You know your computers!!!	St
1.9.3	Thanks again, Ben	St
1.10.1	Only in computers is there a discrepency.	St
1.10.2	And it was not WD (or others) that caused this.	St
1.10.3	It was a short cut by programmers.	St
1.10.4	I could find no document that claimed this drive to be 80 GB (binary.)	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
