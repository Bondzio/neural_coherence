<s> There is better out there. </s>
<s> Emachines T6520 Package for $669.97 after rebates +Better CPU with 64 bit capability +More RAM +Larger harddrive +PCI Express x16 for upgrades +Better ATI Xpress 200 chipset with 128mb of shared memory for integrated graphics. </s>
<s> +15 in. </s>
<s> LCD Monitor However I would reccomend the Emachines T6522 for $689.97 after rebates. </s>
<s> +Better CPU with 64 bit capability +Larger Harddrive than the Dell and T6420 +More RAM than the Dell +Has a TV Tuner unlike the T6520 and your Dell 3000 +PCI Express x16 for upgradability +Socket 939 Motherboard However if you were willing to spend close to a grand without rebates then you could go dual-core. </s>
<s> These systems are more then your 3000 with the free printer and extended waranty. </s>
<s> However, you get so much more for only a $100 difference. </s>
<s> Better deal. </s>
<s> That first computer is selling for $1000 though. </s>
<s> And those are without any warranty. </s>
<s> Also, chip seems worse than what I'm getting with the 3000. </s>
<s> In terms of performance (especially in gaming) the AMD Athlon 64 has always been superior to the Intel P4 in most catagories. </s>
<s> Just look at the Benchmarks . </s>
<s> *Note that the first system I showed you had the Athlon 64 3400+ and the other was the 3500+. </s>
<s> Intel has got caught in the clockspeed war, thinking that more clockspeed equals faster cpu. </s>
<s> That is not true. </s>
<s> Without getting technical, AMD has found otherways to find performance with their chips design such as a fast FSB (Front Side Bus). </s>
<s> The best cpu out there is an AMD FX-57, not an Intel. </s>
<s> If you want some technical stuff read this Discussion Also note that the P4 in your Dell does not have 64-bit capability which will be necessary for future applications. </s>
<s> In other words, the Emachines will last longer. </s>
<s> In regards to the warranty, all Emachines feature a 1 year limited warranty that feature, 1. </s>
<s> One-year guarantee on Parts and Labor. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> One-year technical support via telephone. </s>
<s> You can read about it http://www.emachines.com/support/warranty_info.html#std_warr If 1 year isn't long enough for you, you can purchase an extended warranty through Emachines. </s>
<s> Just scroll down on that page. </s>
<s> Also, Circuitcity and Bestbuy will offer their own warranties to you as well. </s>
<s> Either way your covered. </s>
<s> IMO if your computer has faulty hardware or software you will see a problem within 1 year and extended waranties are unnecessary. </s>
<s> If you take care of your computer you will not need it. </s>
<s> Also, note that if you buy a Dell printer ink is not popular in stores such as Staples, Officemax, and Walmart. </s>
<s> So you will need to buy your ink online if you buy a Dell printer. </s>
<s> Those computers are both in the $1000 range but with rebates they are within your budget. </s>
<s> I know this is not the main point of this chain, but since the printer cable was at least brought up earlier I thought I would through my 2 cents in. </s>
<s> YES - you do need a printer cable if you get the Dell Printer. </s>
<s> I think you may need it for about any printer (they just don't come with them for some reason)BUT instead of the $25 from Dell/Bst Buy/Circuit City - try ebay. </s>
<s> I got a 10 ft one for $2.99 I found for little stuff like cords and cables ebay has great prices. </s>
<s> another example I got a 10 ft ethernet cord for like $5.99 ($30+ in normal stores) again, minor point but still something I thought I would mention </s>
<s> I was aware to buy USB on ebay...thanks though. </s>
<s> Any other recommendations on items/wires/computer items that are better purchased on ebay instead of by dealer? </s>
