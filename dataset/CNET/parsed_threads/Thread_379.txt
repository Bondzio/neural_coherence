<s> If your OS is XP, then that's it, 2.2gb limit. </s>
<s> There is nothing you can do and even if so, it would be another cost and hassle. </s>
<s> Only the newer mtrbds. </s>
<s> and Vista and later OS(64-bit) will work as clean as possible. </s>
<s> Visit the Seagate support website and review it's FAQ. </s>
