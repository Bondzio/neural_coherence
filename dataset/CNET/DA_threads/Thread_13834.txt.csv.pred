1.1.1	I have a SMARTDISK USB 2.0 bus powered portable 40 GB notebook HDD.	St
1.1.2	Although it has the SMARTDISK brand on it CREATIVE has exactly the same product as CREATIVE USB HDD.	St
1.1.3	The problem is that, no matter which USB port I plug the device in, XP keeps saying that it's not plugged into a USB 2.0 port and the device works really slow (at USB 1.1 speed).	St
1.1.4	I tried the device with a number of desktops and notbeooks, and with every USB port on these computers, but always got the same result.	St
1.1.5	The device has a &quot;Y&quot; shaped plug going into the computer, that is two USB plugs parallel.	St
1.1.6	I think one of them is for draining power from another USB port if the main doesn't have enough power.	St
1.1.7	That's what I experienced using the plugs in combinations.	St
1.1.8	It works with the main one plugged in only .	St
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The device with the Y is likely an USB 1.1 hub.	St
1.2.2	Upgrade that.	St
1.2.3	If I didn't understand this proper, please supply a link or picture of the products.	St
1.2.4	In closing, many laptops don't have USB 2.0 ports.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry, I led to a misunderstanding.	St
1.3.2	I was referring to the USB harddisk by &quot;device&quot;.	St
1.3.3	So, there is only a HDD with it's cable.	St
1.3.4	I couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: Cable(s) Included 1 USB cable External Cables included qty 1 Cables form factor External Cables type USB cable I tried the HDD with many new desktops, that i am sure they have USB 2.0 ports.	St
1.3.5	XP keeps saying I'd better plug into another port..	St
1.3.6	Here is the link to the manufacturer's web page: http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=497&subcategory=514&product=11172 (as a matter of fact, Noon Technology Co., Ltd., China is manufacturing the IDE-to-USB and the case) Thanks	St
1.4.1	If that is so, then go with what works.	St
1.4.2	The alternative is to return the product as defective.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
