<s> Hi, About 6 months ago I bought a 160GB Seagate internal hard disk. </s>
<s> Unfortunately during the process of installation I dropped it once. </s>
<s> After installing it, I found that there was a lot of bad sectors in the disk (most likely due to the drop) and I managed to use Scandisk to fix them. </s>
<s> Since then, the hard disk has been working fine. </s>
<s> However, yesterday when I was shutting down the computer, it hanged and the hard disk activity light was on (no blinking). </s>
<s> I waited for about 15 mins and there was further action from the computer, so I pressed the restart button and the computer restarted. </s>
<s> As usual, it would attempt to detect the IDE devices at the start screen. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, it was not able to detect the Seagate hard disk this time (it can still detect my CD-ROM and CD-Writer) and therefore was not able to boot up. </s>
<s> I've tried using Win ME startup disk as well as the Win ME CD-ROM to try to boot up the computer, and the computer booted to the DOS prompt. </s>
<s> But I was unable to reinstall Win ME as no hard drive has been detected/installed. </s>
<s> Am I correct in thinking that my hard disk has really died and cannot be resurrected? </s>
<s> Need any data off that drive ? </s>
<s> Do that first. </s>
<s> Next...go to the Seagate website and download their IDE hard drive diagnostic. </s>
<s> Once downloaded, run the SW which will create a bootable floppy disk with their diagnostic program called Seatools. </s>
<s> It should give you a reading on the drive's 'health'. </s>
<s> Good Luck VAPCMD </s>
