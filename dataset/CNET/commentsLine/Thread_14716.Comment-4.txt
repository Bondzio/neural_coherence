here are some alternatives to the 7800gs.
higher price = higher performance.
here's a xfx 7600gs for $131:  and here's a bfg 6800gs for $176:  another alternative would be an ati x800xt all-in-wonder for about $185.
the 6800gs and x800xt will need a good 350w/400w power supply so add that to your budget if you're unsure about your current power supply.
