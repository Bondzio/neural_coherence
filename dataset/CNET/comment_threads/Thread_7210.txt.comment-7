Thank you all for your contributions, but I feel I need to clarify my situation, so here are my components, or what I hope they will be: - CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 955 or higher processor ($120-$140) - Motherboard: MSI 880GM-E43 ($80 -$20 MIR) or MSI 870U-G55 ($90 -$20 MIR) - RAM: Corsair 6GB Tri channel XMS3 DDR3 RAM ($53) - GPU: have an EVGA Geforce 8400GS 1GB card already, and once I upgrade, I'm pretty sure I can get my hands on a Nvidia Geforce GT420 for a small sum of money - HDD: planning on using my old 120 GB hard drive until its served as long as it will.
- OS: opting to use a copy of Windows XP Professional, as I am more than hesitant to upgrade to Vista or 7.
- Case: If an upgrade to the PSU is necessary, I will probably spring for a Thermaltake V3 Black Edition ($45 - $10 MIR) - PSU: If necessary, something like an Antec Basiq 500W would probably do the trick ($50 -$10 MIR) (that is, assuming 500W will adequately supply my components.
* Total:$348-$378, before a total of $40 in rebates.
Again, this computer will be used for only a light to moderate amount of gaming and 3D modeling, mainly to get me started on a more high-performing computer setup.
Tell me what you think, and thanks again for all the advice.
