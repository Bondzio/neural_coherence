<s> I want to buy a computer that I can use for gaming, photos, internet...I am considering an HP pavillion a1730n: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor 4600+ 2.4GHZ, 512KB+512KB L2 Cache 2GB PC2-4200 DDR2 SDRAM 320GB 7200RPM Serial ATA hard drive NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE Graphics with 128MB dedicated graphics memory Genuine Windows Vista Home Premium I understand the video card would probaly need to be upgraded and have heard this could mean upgrading the power supply too, I would appreciate any comments about using this system for gaming. </s>

<s> I got a 7640 model with the same specs and x2-5000. </s>
<s> Works great. </s>
<s> The only thing I will do eventually is put in a $100 video card with like the one of the 7600 nvidia's. </s>
<s> ive read its only a tiny 300w but im not absolutely certain... anyways its not over 400w for sure </s>
<s> Watch those posting dates. </s>
<s> I bought an HP a1730n just over a year ago. </s>
<s> It was great at first. </s>
<s> ONE day after the one year warranty expired, it completely crashed. </s>
<s> The hard drive and motherboard had to be replaced. </s>
<s> HP pre-loads and locks down the operating system to prevent theft or something, so the recovery disks made with the original don't work on the new hard drive. </s>
<s> They sent me replacement disks at my cost and those didn't work either. </s>
<s> After several frustrating calls to HP, they assured me they would send the correct disks (overnight delivery which was going to take 3 days - figure that one out!). </s>
<s> I never did receive those disks. </s>
<s> So, I marched right back to where I bought it, and after almost 5 hours (yes, five hours) of their tech service talking to many HP techs, HP couldn't figure out why the operating system wouldn't load. </s>
<s> HP never even offered to reimburse me for the disks that didn't work and told me that &quot;customer compensation&quot; is not covered under the warranty (which had expired by one day). </s>
<s> I sent a certified, return receipt letter to the President, who simply handed it off to a customer service rep that was empowered to do nothing more than apologize. </s>
<s> DO NOT BUY AN HP PRODUCT. </s>
<s> THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE AFTER-THE-SALE SERVICING AND DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. </s>
