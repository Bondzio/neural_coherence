Thank you Bob, The os Win xp Pro service pack2 with all the updates installed.
I am sure this is a software problem.
But I verified with spybot, microsoft anti spyware and some other anti spy ware as well.
I am currently testing WinSock XP Fix.
Could a device can be unrecognize due to this kind of a bug?
I will post again if that won't solve the problem.
Thank you Assaf OS: Windows XP Service pack 2
