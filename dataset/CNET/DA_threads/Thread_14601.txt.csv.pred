1.1.1	Hi I am a computer programmer and I would like to buy a Big Screen TV for a computer monitor .	St
1.1.2	The question I have is this a good idea and if so which kind should I get an LCD or Plasma .	St
1.1.3	What should the specs of the tv should be ie ... resolution , 1080 , 720 .	St
1.1.4	I would really like to hear from anyone that has done this .	St
1.1.5	I do n't want to pay $ 3000 on a 1080i 50 & quot ; plazma tv only to find that it does not work as a computer monitor .	St
1.1.6	Please help Thank you	Sug
1.2.1	If your graphics card has a VGA output and you have an adapter and the proper cables the hook into a TV you should be ok .	St
1.2.2	If this is true what graphics card do you have .	St
1.2.3	Some older ones have VGA output and wo n't be able to support that awesome 1080 p resolution .	St
1.2.4	and also i think all TV 's can support as a screen .	St
1.2.5	don ; t quote me on that because i might depend on your operating system and system specs , but your a computer programmer so i suspect that you have a pretty nice system .	St
1.3.1	Then any resolution will do .	St
1.3.2	I once had a plasma ( 480p ) and it looks great .	St
1.3.3	If the tv does n't have a VGA connection , then you want you the highest resolution you can afford ( 1080p would be nice ) and the video output connection that matches the tv , ideally because you do n't want to mess with adapter ( just my thought ) .	St
1.4.1	he needs the adaptor to connect his computers display to his TV 's display , thats the only way i know of doing it .	St
1.4.2	the graphics card usually has a VGA output and it almost always comes with a VGA adaptor .	St
1.4.3	He 'll be fine .	Polite
1.4.4	1080 p is also very nice of he can afford it .	St
1.5.1	Sure , pretty much any of the Biggies have a VGA hook up also DVI but that would require a DVI capable Vid card in your puter .	St
1.5.2	Just go with VGA and you should be fine .	St
1.5.3	A really good one is a Samsung and I would stick with LCD instead of Plasma for your purposes plus a bit less expensive .	St
1.5.4	Good luck and have fun ! !	Polite
1.5.5	!	St
1.6.1	Sorry , it was not my intention to make a comment about your reply .	St
1.6.2	I was just trying to do it as simply as possible ... and that would be just a cable between the devices .	St
1.6.3	I do n't know what connection the person has on the computer , other than vga for sure and we certainly do n't know what TV the he/she going to get yet .	St
