<s> Hi there, I have a compaq armada laptop. </s>
<s> The battery will not charge and I am unable to switch on the computer even if the power supply is plugged in. </s>
<s> It happened before once but then started working again. </s>
<s> It is fine once there is power into it. </s>
<s> Please help? </s>
<s> Carolyn. </s>
<s> that sounds like a bad conector on the motherboard time for a service shop to look at it </s>
<s> http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HD-108 That and a desktop and we save the files that the owner didn't. </s>
<s> Cheap. </s>
<s> As to the laptop. </s>
<s> Remove all removable parts, put it all back together and try again. </s>
<s> Try without the battery. </s>
<s> No? </s>
<s> Time for the repair shop. </s>
<s> Just my fair warning -&gt; Don't take a laptop in such a condition to the corner PC repair shop. </s>
<s> They do desktops well, but not this one. </s>

<s> If you have warranty still, use it. </s>
<s> If not, remove battery and clean contacts on both, the laptop and battery. </s>
<s> Make sure of no collapsed contacts and retry. </s>
<s> If you had the battery more than 12-18mos. </s>
<s> already consider a replacement. </s>
<s> Batteries are fickle items so follow any recovery hints/tips that Compaq offers at thier support website. </s>
<s> There's nothing more to do for the end-user other than take to repair center or such. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> &gt;Don't take a laptop in such a condition to the corner PC repair shop I agree, under warranty or not.. if you need to repair it send it back to Compaq, there are some cowboys out there who will trash your laptop (from experience). </s>
<s> Is the power adapter good? </s>
<s> Compaq had a recall on certain versions of these and they do go bad. </s>
<s> I know I am reviving a thread that is 18 months old, but I recently purchased a Compaq Armada M700 giving the exact same problems described here! </s>
<s> It just starts working again if you leave the laptop for a while. </s>
<s> I have found no sollutions yet, but a few explanations came after a few hours of googling. </s>
<s> The battery is fine - the LEDs on the battery shows it is fully charged, battery monitoring tools pick up the battery as normal. </s>
<s> Dignostics shows all the information that you could possibly want to know about the battery, yet it is as dead as a doornail if you pull the AC adapter! </s>
<s> Apparently there is a problem with the micro controller inside the battery. </s>
<s> It crashes and doesn't want to discharge the battery because the battery thinks it is still charging. </s>
<s> The cells are still fine. </s>
<s> If this is true or not, I don't know - but it is the *only* explanation I could find... </s>
<s> I hope someone can help out with this! </s>
<s> There's quite a bit of Armada parts out on ebay. </s>
<s> You can try another mainboard or battery to see which it is. </s>
