i have an amd x2 4400 in a thermaltake xaser iii v2000a aluminum case with an asus a8n-sli motherboard.
i have an amd certified opteron/64/fx heatsink fan (it was inexpensive) and currently idle at a temp 40-47c.
my warning goes off when it reaches 60.8c.
when i play some games, such as call of duty 2, i reach the warning temp and i shut the comp off.
would a better heatsink fan eliminate this and reduce idle temp?
if so, which one do you recomend?
this doesnt happen often and the case has 7 fans.
