Everything seems ok but I have the 24 pin power connector on. but dont have the 12v 4 pin coming from the power supply. there was a 6 pin connector off the power supply which i plugged in, and the system booted ok.is this ok to use as is. its a thermaltake v2 case with a 450 watt PSU.

This is like you asking if some unknown thing may or may not be OK with or without a connection. I can't see how any answer would be possible so let's go with common sense. The seller must answer basic questions or suffer returns. Bob
