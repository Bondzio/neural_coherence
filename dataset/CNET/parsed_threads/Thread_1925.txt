<s> this is the strangest problem ive had with a computer. </s>
<s> my father in law bought us a new harddrive to go in a computer, he bought a western digital 320gb eide (enhanced IDE) harddrive. </s>
<s> The problem with it is, it will only work on the slave side of the cable. </s>
<s> i have the jumper on the hard drive set to master, and planed on using the old hardriver that was in this pc as the slave. </s>
<s> if i put the new western digital on the master part of the cable, it will say something like invalad boot disk or something like that. </s>
<s> i forget what it says. </s>
<s> but when i put it back on the slave part of the cable, it will boot up like it suppose too. </s>
<s> has anyone ever heard of that kind of problem with a hardrive? </s>
<s> oh, my pc is a hp pavilion 533w , i have 1gb of memory in it. </s>
<s> Is it 80 conductor and is anything else connected? </s>
<s> You should be using an 80 conductor cable. </s>
<s> The default for these is the blue end goes to the MB, the black to the master and gray to the slave device. </s>
<s> But, what you do is set all connected devices to &quot;cable select&quot; or CS. </s>
<s> You don't set master/slave when using these. </s>
<s> Change to CS and, if you're using an 80 conductor cable, it should work with either black or gray. </s>
<s> The days of setting it with master and slave passed about a decade ago with the arrival of 80 conductor cables. </s>
<s> Try the new method of CABLE SELECT or CS and the end of the cable is master and the center is slave. </s>
