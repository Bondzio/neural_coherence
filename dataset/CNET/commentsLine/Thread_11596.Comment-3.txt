thank's for reply toni.i put report in this morning to dell and am waiting for reply.i would really hope not to have to box it back up for shipping.maybe the sound is harmless.i recently had two ear procedures done and ears may be too sensitive.maybe id better ask a few people to come in and listen to it for opinion.thank's again for reply.
