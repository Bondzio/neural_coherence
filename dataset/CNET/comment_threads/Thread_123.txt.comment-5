It's really quite simple.
You shouldn't have to change anything in the BIOS.
I had a Dell with a 40GB hard drive and I added a 120GB with no problem.
The only thing to watch is how you actually connect the second drive.
On my drive, the jumper pins were set for the &quot;cable select&quot; method.
In fact, I don't think I even had to change the pins on the new drive since most use the cable select method now.
