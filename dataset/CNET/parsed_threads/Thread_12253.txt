<s> Can anyone give me advice as to which home user or SOHO level hardware firewall device has the best firewall and IDS (intrusion detection system) logging capabilities. </s>
<s> I know the low-end Netgear routers have a very limited logging system. </s>
<s> I've never used any of the Netgear Prosafe models. </s>
<s> But I don't know how they compare to the Linksys models, for example Linksys BEFSX41. </s>
<s> I'd love to get some advice on this withouth me going out and buying each brand and having to try each one out. </s>
<s> Since no firewall can tell the difference from proper access and an intrusion, there are no products that will fit your requirements. </s>
