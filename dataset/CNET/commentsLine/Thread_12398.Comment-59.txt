ccaputo7, or anyone else using the xerox 8560 ... you said that it feeds the envelopes great.
i cannot get a single envelope of any size through mine without it jamming up.
have any tricks to share?
i just got mine out of the box and love how it printed on the stardream cardstock.
also need it to print on the matching envelopes, to see about the smudging problem you talked about, but can't even get them to go through!
