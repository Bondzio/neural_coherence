Does anyone know if this is true? Thanks.

Sunlight is accepted to deteriate plastics, insulation, heat up devices and in short decrease the lifespan of what you set in the sunlight. This is not specific to monitors and why some building add UV filters to the glass or install shades. As to brightness, it's all relative. That's a nuclear powered light source to compete with. Bob

Overall, it shortens the life span of any electronics, to include a CRT. Plus, if sunlight effects the viewing, typically the user will adjust for better display which usually is a higher output and again decrease the overall ideal properties of the CRT. enuff said, hope this helps... tada -----Willy
