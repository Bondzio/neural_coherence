hardwired wins out over wireless where latency is concerned even with great reception, especially for the xbox360.
max distance for cat 5 cable is 100m, so you still have 100ft or so to play with on top of the 200ft you are planning.
if you aren't concerned with latency, than wireless is by far the easier solution.
