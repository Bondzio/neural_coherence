<s> I finally tried to build my first computer today with the parts listed below, but when I try to turn on the computer, nothing happens. </s>
<s> I disconnected all the peripherals from the PSU to eliminate that as a problem, but it still won't start. </s>
<s> When I initially flip the switch for the PSU, the lights on my keyboard (Caps lock and the like) flash for a second, but then when I hit the power button on the case, it doesn't turn on. </s>
<s> The PSU never makes a noise and the fan doesn't move. </s>
<s> I thought this might be because I only used 2 out of the 3 cables that you can't detach from the PSU (the website says that all &quot;non-vital&quot; cables are detachable, so maybe I need to use all 3 of these &quot;vital&quot; cables?). </s>
<s> I used the 8 pin CPU connector and the 24 pin main power connector, but am not using the 4 pin CPU connector since there is nowhere on the motherboard to put it. </s>
<s> Do the lights on the keyboard mean the PSU works and I'm just doing something wrong or is the PSU dead? </s>
<s> Or is it something else entirely, like the motherboard being dead? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> If proper connections are made it should work. </s>
<s> Its important to review the manual and verify the connections are going to where they need to go. </s>
<s> Also, the frt. </s>
<s> panel power-ON/OFF harness si proper. </s>
<s> You can remove the harness and using a small screwdriver or metal contact, short the contact for a split sec. </s>
<s> and see if it powers-ON. </s>
<s> That way yu know at least the proper contact was active. </s>
<s> Next, check the video connection, if not on video car or on-board is connected, that way at least a flash may appear or not bit indicates power again is present. </s>
<s> The monetarily flash you see1st powering-ON is only the surge and means only power is present BUT not active(ON?OFF) status. </s>
<s> Alas, not cables/harness need be connected, if all that are required are connected. </s>
<s> New PSUs come ready for various setups and thus not all are needed. </s>
<s> Check and verify all is fully seated and OK, take your time. </s>
<s> You need to make a simple(basic) system, only enough to power-ON the system. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, again some connection isn't pressnt or misconnected. </s>
<s> Of course, if all else fails, you can then though the status of components being OK, swap and replace. </s>
<s> Google for bad caps or such and look for exmaples at www.badcaps.com. </s>
<s> -OR- a troubleshooting chart giving ideas to check following the chart. </s>
<s> You can't take anything for granted. </s>
<s> If possible test compnets elsewhere. </s>
<s> You didn't mention what wattage PSU was, is it better than 400W and a decent name brand? </s>
