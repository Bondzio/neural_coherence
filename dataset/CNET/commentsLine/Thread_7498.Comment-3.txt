my preference is to use the smaller drive for the os and applications.
80gigs will hold a ton of these.
your 80gig shows quicker specs but i am not certain that is correct with a 2meg cache, however.
you do want your main drive to perform well.
the larger drives are well suited for storage and can be used as backups for other data.
i have mine done this way and use imaging software to backup my entire hard drive as a compressed image on larger secondary drives as part of my distaster recovery scheme.
in the end, however, your opinion and needs outweigh all outside advice.
good luck with your project.
