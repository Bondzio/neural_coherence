You do make valid points.
It is important to know how long a business has been runing, especially when they are offering warrenty information.
If you visited archive.org, you would notice that in 2007, that Visualdreamers was a movie selling company.
In 2009, it started selling computers.
If you feel like shellinng out 2000+ dollars to them, be my guest.
I don't like seeing people get sucked into these.
I was a victim before, luckily it only costed me 30 dollars.
