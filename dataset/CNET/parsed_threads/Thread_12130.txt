<s> I have a old computer that I ran the Network setup wizard before but I DID NOT do anything with it. </s>
<s> I now have a new computer. </s>
<s> I ran the Network Setwork Wizard on it. </s>
<s> I then ran the setup on my son's wireless laptop and I can see his shared folders and vice versa. </s>
<s> I guess the new computer is the host? </s>
<s> I tried doing the same for my old computer (as client?). </s>
<s> The setup said it was OK but I could not see the shared files from either the new or old computer. </s>
<s> Is this because I had the old computer set up as Host before and never did use it? </s>
<s> Can I somehow remove this old computer as the host and then do the wizard thing again? </s>
<s> Or what do I have to do? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help. </s>
<s> My set up is like this. </s>
<s> All thre computers running Xp. </s>
<s> My internet connection is wall to DSL Modem to Router and then to the three computers. </s>
<s> Only the Laptop is wireless. </s>
<s> You should have set it up as a workgroup ( all computers equal no host or clients). </s>
<s> Did you try running the network setup wizard again. </s>
