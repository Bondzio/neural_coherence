<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8200 series desktop with 512 MB PC800 RDRAM memory, Pentium 4 processor at 2.0 GHz and Windows XP home OS. </s>
<s> I have a 64 MB NVIDIA Geforce MX graphics card but I have access to a 256 MB one that I could install instead. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade this for my grandson to use to play &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. </s>
<s> Would it be worth it to upgrade the memory? </s>
<s> What about the processer speed? </s>
<s> I wouldn't need a new mother board, would I? </s>
<s> And why would you need a new motherboard, anyway? </s>
<s> Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Kathy K. </s>
<s> rdram is relative expensive ($30 for 256mb) and cpu-wise you'd have to search for a used processor in the 2.2-2.4ghz range ($30) and *hope* it works. </s>
<s> add a decent 256mb agp card ($70) and you've spent $120 (and a lot of effort) or so on a PC that is still way behind the curve and far slower than any new dual-core $400 PC. </s>
<s> Here are the specs for your system: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim8200/specs.htm#1101572 On ram increase you must install in &quot;pair&quot; the RIMM type ram. </s>
<s> This is getting harder to find, but maybe the best bet to help the system along. </s>
<s> Since, you mention you have 512mb installed, more than likely 2x256mb sticks of ram. </s>
<s> That leaves to 2 more slots to fill, so another 2x256mb will do. </s>
<s> Otherwise, the bad scenario is you have 4x128mb install, meaning 4 sticks of ram, you have to sacrifice at least 1pair to be lost when you install the new ram. </s>
<s> I'm not there, so you need to figure what you actually have. </s>
<s> Follow the link, but the info/details are provided via the Dell support website. </s>
