<s> About a year ago I bought and tried a variety of wireless interface &quot;devices&quot; for my desktop, including a Netgear WG111 USB adaptor, and lately an inexpensive D-Link PCI card with antenna. </s>
<s> Even with one wall between the desktop and the router, with a total space of about 20 ft., my connection would occasionally cut out and be generally unreliable. </s>
<s> I just moved my desktop within line-of-sight of the router with the Netgear adaptor from about 50ft away and I can only manage 36-48Mbps. </s>
<s> I've also tried different routers with similar results. </s>
<s> What's more frustrating is my laptop with onboard wireless never loses the signal no matter where I am. </s>
<s> So my question is would it be worth it to spend more money on higher quality network hardware? </s>
<s> I've held off because it seems like most of the claims on the boxes of the $100 routers and $75 desktop cards are dubious at best. </s>
<s> Or if I'm going through walls am I out of luck regardless of the product? </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Updated firmware in the router? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Interference from other networks or 2.4 GHz devices? </s>
<s> These are common problems with wifi and not solved by replacements. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> My adapter is picking up about 6 other networks in the area, all of which are on channel 6. </s>
<s> I switched to channel 11 which seemed to help; would that of helped, or am I just imagining things? </s>
<s> I'll check for a firmware update for the router. </s>
