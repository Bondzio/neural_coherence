I want to buy a laser printer, and my final choices are Samsung ML 2010 and HP 1020. I saw the reviews on the Web, so I know that the performances of ML 2010 are better than of those of HP 1200. On the other hand, users rating of HP 1020 is higher. The price here, in Montenegro, is 135$ + tax, for ML 2010, and 127$ + tax, for HP 2010. That is not the significant difference, but my main concern is the quality of printing, as well as the reliability of the printers. No one spoke of malfunctions, so I do not know, in that way, which of these two printers is better choice. I hope you can help me with this iossue.

The LaserJet plus was 13 years old and I gave it away but they tell me it still works. At those prices why not? As to print quality, unless you are looking for engraved litho output these are just fine for legal papers and more. Bob
