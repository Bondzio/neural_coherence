Some folk &quot;know&quot; they want some feature of ATI or Nvidia so it's not what I can pick for folk. These are high end cards and you see them swap positions on the charts depending on the game or benchmark. Today there is another piece of advice for new builders. -&gt; Get a single rail power supply so you don't have to check Amperes on the rails or &quot;balance the rails.&quot; Bob

Whoever is offering the products should quote the exact parts.... the component name (i.e. 'Case'), the manufacturer Ii.e. 'Cooler Master') and the model number (i.e. 'Elite 430 Black RC-430-KWN1'). Most cases come with no power supply however some mfgs sell the exact same case WITH power supplies. It's a much better practice to know exactly what you're getting before you commit to a purchase. Both of those video cards pull a fair amount of power and an el-cheapo 700W PSU may not be sufficient to support the system under continuous load. VAPCMD

If you compromise on the GPU you may be upset. If you don't compromise on the GPU you are still well above the requirements for using the internet. Bob

8338	14	551825	5254329	5254300	VAPCMD	1/1/12 4:06 PM	1.32543396E12	Looks good.....here's a link for power supplies	between 600W and 700Ws. You probably don't need 700Ws but its better to have the capacity and not need it versus need it and not have it. The other thing...all 700W PSUs are NOT created equal ....as some have the watts but are not efficient and use more electricity to provide the power needed, the warranty is much shorter, and the watts/AMPs aren't where they're needed. As with most things...you generally get what you pay for. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007657%20600014022&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;bop=And&amp;Pagesize=100 Another source for info about power supplies is http://www.jonnyguru.com Let us know how it turns out.
