My old laptop is basically kaput.
If I try to boot my comp, it may crash the hard drive.
I'd like to remove my old laptop's hard drive and somehow use it as a secondary hard drive on my newer laptop (so that my old hard drive won't crash and so that I can transfer files off it).
What do I need to make this a reality?
