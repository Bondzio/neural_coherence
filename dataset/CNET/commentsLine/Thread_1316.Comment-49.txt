i first hooked up my computer to a stereo almost 20 years ago using rca jacks.
now, i have a toslink connection to my surround sound receiver.
i don't have a traditional tv, but i do have an hdmi connection from my video card to a hi-def projector with a 7 foot screen.
i also have a tuner card, so i can watch tv in a window on my desktop while i do other things on the pc, or go full screen on the projector.
my broadband connection, while not as good as i get in japan, is good enough for me to stream movies from netflix with a very short, maybe 2 minute, download time.
i'm very happy with this setup.
including the pc, receiver, and projector, i have about $2500 invested.
