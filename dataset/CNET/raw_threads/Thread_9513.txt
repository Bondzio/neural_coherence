14786	0	24615	271212	NR	jamesebaker	6/2/04 2:43 PM	1.08618738E12	Full Capacity of HDD Not Recognised	I have an additional 200Gb HDD and only 31.4Gb is showing up. It was showing the full 200Gb but all of a sudden it is not. I know there is a problem with XP OS's without SP1 but I have SP1 and all updates that have been released so it can't be that. My set-up: Athlon XP 2100 512Mb RAM HDD 1 = 80Gb HDD 2 = 200GB XP SP1

I have a theory brewing that a new piece of MALWARE could remove the 48-bit registry entry noted at http://www.48bitlba.com/enablebiglbatool.htm and cause users too much grief. I'm sharing that this is only a theory in that I've only presented it for testing to &quot;someone&quot; and the pest, parasite and malware issue seems to be getting worse. It's so bad that a common piece of advice I hand out daily is to not use IE when you can use anything else. Why stand in the line of fire? Check that registry entry and let us know. If you are doing 'anything' dangerous with your PC such as P2P, using IE/OE, then you may want to move to 137GB drives. Bob

I offered the 48bit test as a test and not a &quot;solution.&quot; Sadly, the solution is to use the disk partitioning tool (Disk Management) to delete, create, format the new space again and then restore from your last backup. I don't have a spare machine to see what effect flipping the 48bit registry on and off will do, but hope the malware fighters that I noted this to will look into it. Bob

If your motherboard doesnt support large HDD's then you will need to flash update it, check that out at the MB's homesite....

You must use NTFS to get the full 200GB with XP. Since you are only getting 32GB it sounds like you are trying to use FAT32.

Is there a way of partitioning the rest of the HDD as NTFS and have one part FAT32 and one part NTFS to save reformating the whole drive or is this not possible?
