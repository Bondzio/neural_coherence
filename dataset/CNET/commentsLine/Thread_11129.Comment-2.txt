hi everyone, i just realized that in theory a std should set the specs and therefore all routers should have the same a) download/upload speeds and b) coverage strength/distance.. however, antennas, radio rx/tx, maybe even packet management and other matters may differentiate a) & b)... so, i'm back at having to read all the reviews... has anyone had to buy an n std, dual band router recently?
did anyone have to read all the reviews concerning a) & b)?
can anyone cut my research time and give me the reply?
thanks to anyone who did the research and is willing to share it.
ciao, tommaso
