<s> I have just installed a 400 GHD to be used strictly for backup. </s>
<s> My computer sees the HD, but when I try to utilize it for a backup, I kept getting the message, &quot;unreadable&quot;. </s>
<s> I went ahead and formatted it, (NTFS) and tried again. </s>
<s> It will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bill </s>
<s> You might want to supply this information. </s>
<s> As well, you could test the ability to access the drive by manually copying some of your data from your primary drive to the new one. </s>
<s> Steve, thanks so much. </s>
<s> I thought that I would &quot;play&quot; with the backup, (WIN) this morning and everything worked like a charm. </s>
<s> Again, thanks, Bill </s>
