<s> Ok here goes. </s>
<s> I have tried everything thing I know from True Image to new mobo, PSU, RAM, CPU etc. </s>
<s> Even got a new SATA HDD to image over and it didn't work either. </s>
<s> Originally I had a Epox 8KTA3+ motherboard with RAID 1 and 2 80 GB Western Digitals. </s>
<s> They are working fine, I can access them through a USB on 2.0 but need them to boot up on the new mobo if possible so I don't have to migrate to Vista just yet. </s>
<s> My new mobo is a Gigabyte GA-MA7GM-S2H. </s>
<s> It has RAID on board with SATA too but not working right with these old HDD's. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be apprecaited. </s>
<s> Try the old method of install the OS proper then installing your applications and finally your files from backup? </s>
<s> Changing an existing Windows installation from motherboard to motherboard is not a sure thing. </s>
<s> Why not do this proper? </s>

<s> Bob, Really would like some expert advice on keeping the HDD's the way they are. </s>
<s> I know I can rebuild but don't have the time, or want to. </s>
<s> Furthermore, I want to try to wait on a complete rebuild when I'm ready to move to Vista, not now! </s>
<s> Thanks for your input though. </s>

<s> I know about the XP SP2 REPAIR INSTALL (see google) where I can press the f6 button at the right time to install the needed raid or sata drivers but I don't duplicate web pages about that. </s>
<s> Tell me you have looked into that. </s>
<s> We also have a dead end issue which is where the RAID is setup via some onboard BIOS. </s>
<s> These are usually incompatible from board to board so any expert will point that out to you and suggest we look again at our disaster recovery plans. </s>
