i recently bought 1gb of ram to install in my pc.
i wasn't noticing any difference in the system performance after installing.
so i decided to check and verify that the pc was seeing the newly installed ram.
when i checked, it showed that the only installed ram was the original 512mb.
i ran a few tests, one having just the new ram stick installed and taking out the others.
when the pc started, it just kept making a beeping noise and nothing came up on the monitor.
when i check the bios (i think that's what it is called)it shows the 2-256mb sticks installed but not the 1gb stick.
is this just a case of a bad ram stick or is there a way i can fix it.
(also, i already check to verify i have the correct type of ram)
