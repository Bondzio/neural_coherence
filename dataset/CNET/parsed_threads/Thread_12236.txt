<s> I have a Dell XPS M1530 laptop and it's hooked to my 40 inch lcd tv via HDMI, and I need a nice wireless keyboard with a integrated mouse for surfing and working from home. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to go broke but looking for something solid and handy. </s>
<s> Anyone know of any good wireless keyboard with integrated mouse? </s>
<s> Go to NEWEGG.COM and see what is available, there should be several. </s>
<s> If your L/T has a BLUETOOTH antenna built in, would suggest going that route, see if there are any Logitech units that suit your fancy they generally work very well. </s>
