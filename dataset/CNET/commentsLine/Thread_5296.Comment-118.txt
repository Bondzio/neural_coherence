i purchased a sony with an intel i-3 in february that had the 256mb video card.
this week i took delivery of a lenovo with the intel i-7 and a 1gb video card.
there was a $550 price difference.
instead of worrying about how much you're getting, i'd reconsider the brand of choice first.
look up how many people are complaining about this problem or that because they shopped with dollar amount/price being their first concern.
you'll always get burned in the end when that's your biggest concern.
guess what, quality still counts and when the price is to good to beat, it might be just because that's the only way that brand can sell them in the first place.
only you can decide if you think quality is worth more.
i firmly believe in it.
the 256mb card is just fine for normal internet type applications and i'm having nothing but pure joy with it, but when i found a new machine just 4 months later that had 4 times the amount, i jumped at it.
hold off till you can get a bit higher end machine and you'll always get longer use out of it in the end.
another consideration is weight.
the reason i got the sony was because it only weighs 4 1/2 pounds so i can carry it anywhere, but my desktop replacement is a lot more machine that i'll pretty much leave set up and leave it alone.
no machine does it all.
instead ask yourself how you're going to use it the most, and then decide how much you care about how long it will last without it breaking down or wearing out.
while i normally don't get this stupid with my money, i know that both machines i've purchased this year will still be meeting 90% of all my needs in 3 years and in all likelihood still be decent machines.
to me the higher up front costs are worth the longer usage i'll get out of them overall.
trust me, there are decent values on higher quality machines out there so this time i'd either pay a bit more or hold off till i could afford it.
