1.1.1	Just to let everyone know , I 've yet to find one .	St
1.1.2	Unless you count the s/w bundle you may get with a new drive or system , do n't expect to a freebie out there .	St
1.1.3	I looked high and low with negative results .	St
1.1.4	I wanted to head-off so-called complaints of PowerDVD players install for new blu-ray players just was n't good enough or reliable ( upgrades ) .	St
1.1.5	While my new player will have PowerDVD it seems others just did n't like it and made bad reviews for it , I hope mine is OK .	St
1.1.6	Please advise if you locate one .	Sug
1.1.7	Thanks -- -- -Willy	St
1.2.1	There has been a chilling effect on a free software BR or BD player because of the DMCA and more .	St
1.2.2	If you want to play BD content , I suggest you use the PowerDVD or other software and PLEASE get it with your hardware to save the cost of the standalone software .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Robert , one reason I posted was to no show results of & quot ; no freebie & quot ; out there .	St
1.3.2	Further , since PowerDVD seems to be the typical player packaged with new drives , reviews have been heavily negative .	St
1.3.3	So far , my exposure to PC type drives is small only because many users just have n't gotten aboard with it yet .	St
1.3.4	Now , that the pricing seems to be lower than before , the questions are starting to pop-up for my techie response .	St
1.3.5	the good news is that other players ( paid for ) seem to do a better job than PowerDVD or at least seems that way .	St
1.3.6	Not to push any s/w or point to what is good , but since the typical freebies have done such a great job , I wondered why they are n't available .	St
1.3.7	Already , there 's clambering for VLC to get it done , but & quot ; no go & quot ; for now .	St
1.3.8	I think that will change but not soon enough for most of us new BD owners .	St
1.3.9	-- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Of the DMCA and the BR/BD software consortium is the primary reason why .	St
1.4.2	Since almost all BR/BD content is protected and the software to play it requires the decoder and there is no open source decoder and the DMCA chills the developers you may be waiting a very long time .	St
1.4.3	There 's also no reason to stick to BR/BD .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	is getting bum raps .	St
1.5.2	The hw bundled v7 plays BD fine and like later versions , only decodes stereo , not multichannel .	St
1.5.3	For latter you have to pay .	St
1.5.4	Also trial versions can not be patched with released fixes so evaluators are left wanting .	Sug
1.5.5	v10 Mark 2 has played new discs for me so far without hiccup .	St
1.5.6	And do n't forget to update reader firmware from mfr if you expect it to work for new discs .	Ques
