just what is a emachine?
stop advertising for crapola computers... -_- seriously, it doesn't matter.
the gap between processors isn't nearly as much as some of these hardcore gamers would like you to think.
if it's top performance you want, either amd or pentium is fine.
if it's value, get celeron.
compared to amd and pentium processors running at the same speed, it's much cheaper.
