One runs at 400 mHz fsb the other at 533. My motherboard is at 400 mHz. I do not even get into bios, simply see that the PC is on, but it does not display anything.

If you find it does, it may lack needing a &quot;bios update&quot;. Which in many cases should support newer cpus or accept new cpus that weren't available when the mtrbd. first came out. Visit the mtrbd. or vendor support website and find the specs for your model mtrbd. or system. Follow whatever instructions if a bios update is required and &quot;to the letter&quot;! Before doing any of the above, you should at least try a CMOS clearing of setting to return to default setting of the bios. The CMOS clearing pins/pads are located on your mtrbd. find them and monetarily short them during a power-UP. Unshort(unjumper) the same CMOS pins and allow a reboot to finish the process. Shutdown after such a power_UP &quot;properly&quot; if it does with new cpu appear to work after that, if not then inspect for new bios update. If NO bios update is present or allows to accept your new cpu, verify the jumpers are properly set for the new cpu, provided it does support the new cpu. On some mtrbds. that is &quot;automatically&quot; but you didn't mention what the heck you have. That's where I would start. good luck -----Willy
