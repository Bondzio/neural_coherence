<s> Hi, I have an 06' Dell b110 and it came with a god-awful integrated graphics card. </s>
<s> I wanted to upgrade it, no big deal just dissable the old one right? </s>
<s> I called into dell and the guy said that a new graphics card could never be installed. </s>
<s> That sounded ridiculous to me. </s>
<s> Does anyone know why my computer would not be upgradable? </s>
<s> given I will probably have to upgrade my power supply as well (250wt) </s>
<s> What slots on the motherboard would support that new card? </s>
<s> There isn't an AGP or PCI-E slot I think based on a little Googling I did about that Dell model. </s>
<s> Why would you assume there is such a slot in on entry level system? </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> so I can't do anything shy of a new motheroard? </s>
<s> how feasable is that as opposed to a new computer thanks for the help </s>
<s> Yes, though if you get a new motherboard then you have to see what can be transferred over as well as the limits of the case as some cards are known for being rather big. </s>
<s> My suggestion would be to consider getting a new computer that can be easily upgraded. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> While you won't be playing Bioshock, there are still fx5200 and better PCI cards. </s>
<s> See newegg.com Bob </s>
<s> ok, that was really my question. </s>
<s> the guy made it sound like there was no way without buying a new computer. </s>
<s> thanks a million </s>
<s> how expensive would a pci card be vs. how much better would it be than my integrated? </s>
<s> I thought I noted a link where such could be found. </s>
<s> Is that showing or not? </s>
<s> If not, please tell us so I can report a forum bug. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> my fault i did find the site, thanks for the help </s>
