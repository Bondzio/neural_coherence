motherboards with onboard video are great for the average user.
but for a gamer, not so much.
the motherboard still has to do 60% of the work.
and in your case if you had 2gb of ram, one eighth of that (250mb)is reserved for video use.
it's not quite that simple because that shared memory is dynamically assigned but something has to keep track and move stuff around when needed.
so you are putting an additional load on the system as a whole when you have integrated anything (lan, audio, video).
that load equates to less resources to display video.
but the motherboard mfg'ers trend is unmistakable, less pci expansion slots and more onboard goodies.
back to video.
putting in a pci-e video card will free up the shared memory, overall lowering the system load and giving you better, faster refresh video than ever before.
you can select how much video memory you want when you buy the card.
and another thing, does your new computer have a nice big monitor?
i have never seen an onboard video system do justice to a good monitor.
so here's the short, short recap.
if you will only be a casual user then the onboard video will be just fine for you but if somewhere deep inside there is a gamer looking to get a taste... fyi even google earth will look sooo much different.
