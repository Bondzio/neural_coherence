I just wanted to followup with another query.
I am also setting up a network at home and plan to have modem&gt;router&gt;switch.
However, is it possible to connect some computers and devices to the router's extra ports and the rest of the home's devices to the router?
This is mainly because of geographical constraints (the router has to be in my office room which has only one drop)\ Many Thanks.
