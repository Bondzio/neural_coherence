1.1.1	My wife purchased a Dell desktop system from Best Buy last year ( May 2009 ) .	St
1.1.2	The monitor died on it earlier this summer .	St
1.1.3	Apparently , Dell 's & quot ; 3-year warrantee & quot ; on monitors does not extend to monitors purchased with entire systems , they only carry the one year warrantee that the tower has .	St
1.1.4	First of all , a one year life expectancy on a monitor is a tad short .	St
1.1.5	Second , not honoring the typical warrantee extended to monitors purchased separately is poor business practice .	St
1.1.6	Lastly , if this is the sort of support I can expect from Dell , I 'll likely not be purchasing another computer through them ... either for personal use , or through the university at which I 'm employed .	St
1.2.1	Consider that you can buy an external hard drive with a one year warranty but the drive inside the case may be the same one that carries a three year warranty if you buy it separately .	St
1.2.2	Bundling is about making the total price look more attractive but it does come with a downside .	St
1.2.3	Warranties are not free either .	St
1.2.4	The probability of failure and the cost to cover such is computed in the same way insurance actuaries work and that cost is built into your purchase price .	St
