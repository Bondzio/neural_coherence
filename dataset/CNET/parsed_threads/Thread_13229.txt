<s> I have a USB to PATA IDE adapter for 2.5 and 3.5 size hard drives (similar to one seen at newegg http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812156101 I need to connect a 2.5 laptop hard drive to my desktop through the desktop PATA IDE port, not through the USB port. </s>
<s> I was wondering if it could be used as an IDE converter, to go from 2.5 type to 3.5 cable type (since the end of the cable was the 2.5 plug on one side, and the 3.5 plug on the other side, will the data be correctly assigned though any possible connections within the adapter?). </s>
<s> I was hoping to get an opinion on this before I just plug it in and try it so I don't risk frying the HDD. </s>
<s> Thanks (to get around the male/female match on the adapter and the IDE ribbon cables, I could just plug the 3.5 side of the adapter into the Motherboard PATA IDE port itself. </s>

<s> It works great when making the quick USB connection. </s>

<s> Provided you select the right enclosure, you can connect it to a USB, Firewire, or eSATA port </s>
