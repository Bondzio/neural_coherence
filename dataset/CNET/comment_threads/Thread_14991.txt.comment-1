I did a fresh reinstallation of windows XP and I need to find files that are hidden.
I have about 15 gigs worth of music and I cannot access them.
I know they're in there because the same amount of space is used up on the hard drive.
The pie chart and &quot;free space&quot; are nearly the same as before I reinstalled windows.
Thanks, Clint
