i have been trying to get information on the computers in my network (software installed, os,things like that) by using programs utilizing snmp.
not quite sure what that is, but it was getting me the information i needed, but not on all of my computers.
the software that i was using would do somting like ping, but looking for smnp and said that it couldnt make the connection, but it could get the ip.
anyway.. my question is there a way to turn on snmp?
or is there some way i can find all of these computer's information(they are all on a lan) using somthing else.. thanks!
