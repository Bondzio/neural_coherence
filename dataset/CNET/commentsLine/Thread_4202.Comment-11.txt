i'm about to give up with this unless there's anything else i can try, it's really difficult to diagnose what might be the problem when it will only start once a day and then that's it, no more until the next day.
i've got it running now with just memory, floppy, graphics and keyboard and it booted fine from the floppy........ daren't shut it down now though.. minskin
