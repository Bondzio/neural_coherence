IBM (oops, no more) then Dell, HP etc.
The big problem is that while most makers have fine hardware you might be installing Windows and have issues with Windows, or other software issue.
This is where it all breaks down and you find little support.
If you look at Apple you find a lot less in the virus, trojan, etc so that issue is not a big deal.
Support is better since you deal with just one company for the OS and hardware.
And you pay for what you get... Bob
