This is attempted by a few only to learn that you can't put your ADSL/Cable modem on some &quot;switch&quot; and have a LAN.
It's an INVALID and DANGEROUS configuration and much like directions on how to enter a minefield, I will not help such themselves up for disaster.
To make it work, you get what is called a ROUTER.
The DSL/cable modem goes to the router, the router to your network switch and it works.
