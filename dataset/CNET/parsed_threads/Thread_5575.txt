<s> I need to buy a new power supply for my PC. </s>
<s> I have found a Raidmax and Thermaltake power supply, Is any one brand better than the other? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> http://www.jonnyguru.com/ and then I'd go to Newegg.com and see the PSUs I was interested in and read the buyer reviews. </s>
<s> From there....it's up to you. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Visit: http://www.pcpowerrandcooling.com for the very best psu offerings, period. </s>
<s> Then look for SLI rating or 80% rating proof and/or at least review the specs. </s>
<s> Then pick the largest wattage you can afford(you want to do this once). </s>
<s> I do recommend at least getting a dual fan setup. </s>
<s> Try to get away from gimmick features like LEDs, cabling, fan control, etc., just the basics and then pick those features after that. </s>
<s> Understand most branded(labeled) psu are better than generic offering but even that can be lacking. </s>
<s> Fancy psus do better than most, but if you're demanding alot then spend more, you will be rewarded with stable and dependable outputs and not be a problem later. </s>
<s> I offer no name other than above as it has proven itself more often than not. </s>
<s> Though, you may want to check out Antec and Vantec brands. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> raidmax uses low-end power supplies. </s>
<s> thermaltakes are much better across the board. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
