1.1.1	Would a ''DVD Burner '' such as the http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16827152052 be able to read any type of media and data ?	Ques
1.1.2	I want to be able to use the drive as a regular , CD-ROM game-playing and software-installing drive , a drive which would play music CDs and be able to burn them as well .	St
1.1.3	And can you use DVD-R discs such as http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16827152052 to burn music files and play them in stereos and your computer ?	Ques
1.2.1	DVD-RW drives function exactly like any CD drive .	St
1.2.2	The burners just do more .	St
1.2.3	Good price BTW .	St
1.2.4	Media ?	Ques
1.2.5	Stick with name brands .	St
1.2.6	One problem may be with DVD movies that you may create may not play in a standard DVD player .	St
1.2.7	Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day ; teach that person to use the Internet and they wo n't bother you for weeks .	St
1.2.8	Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about telephones , internet connections , spyware removal , and data , and download free software .	St
1.3.1	But can those CDs be burned with music ?	Ques
1.3.2	Music that I can play on the stereo , CD player and the computer ?	Ques
1.3.3	Its strange because those CDs are 4+ GB , while traditional music CDs are 700 MB .	St
1.3.4	How many minutes would those 4+ GB CDs hold in music ( if they burn music , that is ) ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thank you .	St
1.4.1	So these drives are also burners , right ?	Ques
1.5.1	standard CD 's and 80 minute CD 's for music .	St
1.5.2	Simply look at the link that you sent for the drive .	St
1.5.3	Look closely at the top line , it lists all of the things that the drive will read , will burn , and gives the max speed of each .	St
1.5.4	A year or so ago that drive would have been $ 150 .	St
1.6.1	that it also burns Dual Layer DVD 's .	St
1.6.2	The blank media is rather expensive , over $ 3 per disk and may have many compatibily with other readers .	St
1.7.1	& gt ; Its strange because those CDs are 4+ GB , & gt ; while traditional music CDs are 700 MB .	St
1.7.2	That 's because they 're not CD 's .	St
1.7.3	They 're DVD 's .	St
1.7.4	They may look the same , and even work somewhat the same , but they 're not the same .	St
1.7.5	I never thought about trying to put CD-type audio on a DVD until you brought it up , but according to what I just read , that wo n't work .	St
1.7.6	There are audio DVD 's , but apparently the format is different , so you ca n't just copy the audio from CD 's to a DVD .	St
1.7.7	Even if that 's true , there 's probably a way around that ( a conversion process or something ) .	St
1.7.8	But if you create an audio DVD , a regular CD player would n't be able to play it , because a DVD is just different .	St
1.7.9	A CD drive ( CD player , CD-ROM or CD-RW ) just ca n't read a DVD disc .	St
1.7.10	You may be able to play it on a DVD player or a DVD drive in a computer , but that may depend on the format of the audio , DVD , etc .	St
1.7.11	As for how many minutes of audio a DVD would hold , for CD quality audio you can just & quot ; do the math & quot ; .	St
1.7.12	Let 's say 4.2 GB / 700 MB * 80 minutes on a CD .	St
1.7.13	That should give you an approximation , assuming that you can put CD quality audio on a DVD .	St
1.7.14	You might also be able to ( or have to ) use higher quality audio ( like the audio DVD 's that are out now with enhanced audio ) , which would decrease the amount of audio you could fit on a disc .	St
1.7.15	It seems like you do n't know much about DVD 's , in which case you might try the FAQ at : http : //www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html There 's a lot of info there , but you could start by looking at specific questions that are of interest to you , like & quot ; [ 1.1 ] What is DVD ? & quot ; and & quot ; [ 2.4.1 ] Is CD audio ( CD-DA ) compatible with DVD ? & quot ; .

1.8.1	& gt ; I want to be able to use the drive as & gt ; a regular , CD-ROM game-playing and & gt ; software-installing drive , a drive which & gt ; would play music CDs and be able to burn & gt ; them as well .	St
1.8.2	Theoretically you can do all that , but ... 1 ) Copy-protected CD 's ( like those used for some games ) seem to work best in CD-ROM drives .	St
1.8.3	Sometimes other types of drive can have problems reading those CD 's correctly .	St
1.8.4	I do n't know if DVD-RW drives ever have that kind of problem .	St
1.8.5	IAC , I would n't worry about it too much at this point .	St
1.8.6	It 's just something to be aware of .	St
1.8.7	If you ever have trouble installing or running copy-protected software from a DVD-RW drive , that might be the problem , in which case I 'd suggest trying a CD-ROM drive instead .	St
1.8.8	2 ) Regular audio CD 's should play just fine , but you may have trouble playing a Dual Disc ( CD on one side and DVD on the other ) .	St
1.8.9	I had a lot of trouble getting my DVD-ROM drive to recognize the CD side of a Dual Disc I bought recently .	St
1.8.10	It did n't even see that a disc was loaded .	St
1.8.11	Some research on the 'Net showed that this was not an uncommon problem .	St
1.8.12	After putting the disc in probably 5 - 10 times the DVD-ROM drive finally recognized it .	St
1.8.13	A DVD-RW drive might have similar problems .	St
1.8.14	I do n't know .	St
1.8.15	Again , just something to be aware of .	St
