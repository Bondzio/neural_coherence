Also not an expert, I too have a new Inspiron E1505 with the same Intel Pro Wireless 3945 and I just connected to this router: Linksys SRX200 Wireless-G Broadband Routers with SRX (WRT54GX2) and then networked with an older laptop Dell Latitude C600 (wired).
I currently have PowerLink highspeed internet that is 100 Mbps via WIRED connection.
Is there anyway to get higher speed than 54 Mbps WIRELESS????
Also I find when running on battery power my Inspiron has a very hard time maintaining the wireless connection.
Is there a configuration I need to change?
Could my cordless phone be effecting connectivity???
?
