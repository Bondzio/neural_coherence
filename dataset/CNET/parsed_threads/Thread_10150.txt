<s> Hello there! </s>
<s> I just got a wireless router, and when i play a game and left it and go Away from Keyboard for the night I always disconnect cause the router is shutting itself off cause it thinks that i dont use the net anymore, so it shut itself off to save power and such. </s>
<s> Ive putted &quot;Idle Timeout&quot; to 0. </s>
<s> Heres the discription of idle timout: &quot;An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period. </s>
<s> If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be &quot;kept alive&quot; by re-connecting immediately whenever the connection is lost.&quot; But when it reconnect, ive already disconnected from the game. </s>
<s> So its useless. </s>
<s> I have oxo marked &quot;Connect automatically, as requied&quot; Heres what the connect automatically description says: &quot;Connect Automatically, as Required Normally, this option should be enabled. </s>
<s> An Internet connection will be made automatically after each timeout, whenever Internet-bound traffic is detected. </s>
<s> This provides connection on demand and is potentially cost-saving. </s>
<s> If disabled, you must connect manually, using the &quot;Connection Status&quot; button on the Router Status screen. </s>
<s> This manual connection will stay up all the time without timeouts.&quot; And yes, ive contacted my ISP and they said it wasnt any problems with their stuff and my modem. </s>
<s> But they said it was my router. </s>
<s> Iam using a NetGear RangeMax WPN824 v2. </s>
<s> I didn't check the version but I have firmware version V1.0_51 NA which helped a few items. </s>
<s> It does not shutoff like you note. </s>
<s> Ever. </s>
<s> I wonder if you are connecting with WIFI? </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> WPA, SSID enabled and all other settings at stock save the item you noted. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I got the newest firmware o_O Which is V2.0.10_1.2.17 SSID and WPA is enabled, it was enable before too. </s>
<s> If it is as you say it is, the router is broken. </s>
<s> Mine does not disconnect with the settings noted. </s>
<s> Your post is still light. </s>
<s> But that's good enough for me. </s>
<s> I won't ask if you are checking the router's status page to see if it's truly disconnected from the internet or it's just your machine... Bob </s>
<s> Iam really new at this stuff, so i really dunno. </s>
<s> I will go to the shop where i bought it and ask about the router. </s>
<s> The router is very new, i bought it with my laptop. </s>

<s> That's telling. </s>
<s> Some ISP's chop off users at set times. </s>
<s> Drives the users nuts. </s>
<s> Your ISP should tell you this but some won't. </s>
<s> Again, your status given looks fine. </s>
<s> What does it look like when the router (as you claim) has disconnected? </s>
<s> In closing, one member posted over a dozen posts before they revealed all the details. </s>
<s> The problem was an incompatible setup on their DSL modem. </s>
<s> Again, always the member's choice to share details. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I got ADSL, so i really dont want to get/have my net shutted off in some specific time. </s>
<s> Its really annoying. </s>
<s> And, i dunno how the router status looks like when the router DCs or disconnect. </s>
<s> I will try to check that out next time my router gets disconnected. </s>
<s> I hope i can fix it ASAP. </s>
<s> And Thanks for helping me R. Proffitt ^^ Still posting more information later when ive seen how the router status looks like when it gets disconnected. </s>
<s> Sorry my bad english </s>
<s> DSL, ADSL, etc is &quot;close enough&quot; at the level of discussion. </s>
<s> Let me be very blunt here so I apologize if it seems not well written. </s>
<s> You stated the router is doing the disconnect but didn't look at the router status page. </s>
<s> I have to guess you are looking at some LED or other indication or something else. </s>
<s> That scrap of detail is sorely needed to gain some traction on your issue. </s>
<s> So let be be even more blunt. </s>
<s> Nail it down. </s>
<s> When it's disconnected, look at the router's status page. </s>
<s> Also check that lease time. </s>
<s> It could be &quot;one of those ISP's&quot; that hand out 1 hour leases. </s>
<s> Sorry if it appears you have to become a network IT guru but it's tough to sort out without these items. </s>
<s> Hang in there! </s>
<s> -&gt; In closing there was a nice one the tech fixed recently. </s>
<s> The owner was on DSL and complained of similar after checking email. </s>
<s> It was the old setting in Outlook Express called &quot;Hang up after checking email.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Ive tracked it and it seems not to disconnect anymore, and it might be the game i play. </s>
<s> Since the game servers are in california @USA. </s>
<s> And iam in Oslo @Norway. </s>
<s> But other ppls and my friends does not have that problem, so i wonder...Hmm </s>
<s> I putted the game on and went to sleep tonight, and when i woke up i got shocked. </s>
<s> The game hadnt disconnected. </s>
<s> But it was might luck. </s>
<s> I will try tonight too. </s>
<s> I caught the router shutting down, but this shutdown was for very long so i think its not like those other shutdowns i had before. </s>
<s> I unplugged my modem and the routers power to fix the net again, but heres the router status. </s>
<s> Router Status Account Name WPN824 Hardware Version V2H1 Firmware Version V2.0.10_1.2.17 Internet Port MAC Address 00:18:4D:8A:E3:CF IP Address 0.0.0.0 DHCP PPPoE IP Subnet Mask 0.0.0.0 Domain Name Server </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes i do =o Its standing like..4-5meters from the router and the modem </s>
<s> the same frequencies as the routers. </s>
<s> You can try disconnecting the cordless phone to see if this stops you from disconnecting. </s>
<s> If the problem is gone, then you need to get a cordless phone that is 5gh. </s>
<s> Better yet, while you're connected, turn on the cordless phone and see if you get disconnected. </s>
<s> If you phone allows you to change it's channel, it may or may NOT help. </s>
<s> This is one of the big culprits. </s>
<s> The second one is, when you view the wireless networks in your area, do you see others? </s>
<s> What channel sre they using(right click and left click details)? </s>
<s> They may be using the same channel that you are or one close to yours. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> I will try to check the phone, but i cant see others wireless ch. </s>
<s> I only see 3 other wireless stations (routers) but i cant see which ch their're using. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if this is related, but, under wireless settings you may try changing from &quot;108Mbps&quot; garb to &quot;both b and g&quot;, then changing to channel 1 or 11. these channels do not normally recieve interference from phones and whatnot. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
