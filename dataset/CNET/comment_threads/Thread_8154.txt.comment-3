I have 30gbs of music that I can't afford to lose whereas the other 30gbs of pics and vids are easily replaceable, so I'll follow thru on your disc backup suggestion on the music.
I never realized how huge the disc capacity is for Bluray.
You probably know this already, in my research I've found a lot of folks buy these drives to not just back up their PC's primary drive but to back up another external drive in the event it fails.
What doesn't make sense is that people will support these lemon drives by buying more of the same to backup their backup.
If you don't mind, could you clarify what you meant in the first sentence?
Thanks, Bob.
I'll still look out for a good ext drive.
