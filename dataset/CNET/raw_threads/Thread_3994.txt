How do i get the machine to install the drivers for this new motherboard? It just boots up to a screen that says bootup was interupted and will never boot up on the driver disk. Or I guess even recognize the board. Any suggestions?

Proffitt	9/14/06 6:33 PM	1.15825878E12	Which is why I use the Repair Install method for XP.	99% of time it will correct the OS and save the owner's files they didn't backup. I don't duplicate the instructions here since it's best you pick the instructions that make sense to you. Bob

1270	8	206041	2205456	2205386	R. Proffitt	9/14/06 7:44 PM	1.15826304E12	Never seen that work with XP. Multiple reasons why.	1. Windows XP activation kicks in and since the OS is not on a Emachines board, fails. No big surprise here. The license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more. 2. The repairs for XP I noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of XP. In the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress. I think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here. Bob
