recently, my mouse began to frequently require that i relocate its plug from its current usb port to another.
iow, i often start up or reboot my desktop pc to find no mouse pointer until i move the mouse plug to a different port.
its only a standard 2-key scrolling-wheel usb mouse and my desktop has 2 onboard usb 2.0 ports and a 4-port usb 2.0 pci card.
the mouse seems to work ok with all 6 of these ports, but must often be switched over from 1 port to another.
btw, my pc is a home-built desktop with an amd athlon xp 2200+ and 2gb ddr ram, and my os is win2k-pro that runs on ntfs format.
