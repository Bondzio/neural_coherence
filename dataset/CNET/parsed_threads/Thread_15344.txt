<s> I'm looking to get a new computer soon and I have a lot of files I want to move between my old and new computer (about 60+ GB worth). </s>
<s> I was looking into ways to do that and found out about Crossover cables but then found out there's a lot of set up involved (i.e., &quot;You can't just connect two computers and expect them to share files right away.&quot;). </s>
<s> I'm wondering if the Belkin EasyTransfer cable is better because it does have a plug-and-play aspect to it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I no longer use the ETHERNET CROSSOVER CABLE as most new machines have AUTO MDX (see google). </s>
<s> Setup and use of Windows Easy Transfer has no involved or &quot;lot of&quot; set up. </s>
<s> We plug a cable from the old to the new machine, run Easy Transfer on each machine and enter some 6 digit number and then check off the items we want moved. </s>
<s> What could be easier? </s>

<s> You will now have two PCs? </s>
<s> Never gonna use that old one again? </s>
<s> Never want to get &quot;on line&quot; with it? </s>
<s> Get a router. </s>
<s> Connect the two to the router and turn on file and printer sharing on the PCs. </s>
<s> You can do everything you want and have two surfing PCs. </s>
