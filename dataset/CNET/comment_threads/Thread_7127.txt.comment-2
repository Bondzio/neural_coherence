The common dead Socket A machine is a familiar sight at the repair counter.
We know from experience these are beyond their service life and repairs include replacing motherboard and often the CPU so we know not to touch them as even after the replacement these are still too unstable and result in call backs by the owners about crashes.
If you are in a bind, go find your local FREECYCLE (see google) and watch for someone to give away some Pentium 4 machine.
