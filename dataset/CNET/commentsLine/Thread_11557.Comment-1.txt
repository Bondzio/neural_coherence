so far until today, i've had good luck being a cheapskate and buying expired genuine epson ink cartridges up to a year past the &quot;use before&quot; date.
today though, i tried two black ink cartridges that have a &quot;use before&quot; 7/2004 date and no black ink comes out of them.
the black ink light though does not illuminate on my epson stylus color 600 printer.
i used the cleaning feature 2 times and still no black ink coming out.
i wonder why the black ink light doesn't come on?
it always does when there is no ink left.
will running the cleaning cycle 10 times help or did the ink dry up in the hermetically sealed cartridge?
what has been your luck with expired ink cartridges?
