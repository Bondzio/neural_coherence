1.1.1	Hi, I,m just planning on buying a computer and i wonder if a sound card really makes any difference?	St
1.1.2	I would gladly accept recommendations about different sound cards which have got good test results and are worth the money.	St
1.2.1	(listening to music and sound with movies) the sound built in motherboards is quite good enough.	St
1.2.2	But maybe you've got some special requirements you don't mention?	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	Unless you're an audiophile or require a specific audio need, what comes with a typical system now will do fine.	St
1.3.2	Of course, you can usually upgrade after the purchase later.	Ques

1.4.1	The one lackluster area of onboard I've found is the occasional lack of stereo inputs.	St
1.4.2	The next is the analog inputs tend to be noisy compared to any Creative Labs card made in the past decade.	St
1.4.3	Beyond that I'd try the onboard sound first.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	If you're thinking of a ready-made computer (assembled in a factory, ala HP or Dell), it's gonna have audio on the motherboard, and is going to be quite good sounding, surround-sound capable and all that jazz.	St
1.5.2	I'd encourage you to try the built-in before investing in an add-on.	St
