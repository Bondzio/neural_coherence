you also might want to get pqmagic - it can make partitions and is fairly easy to do.
i have had it for many years so dont know if it can be had as download from cnet.
another - regseeker.
it is a free download from cnet and i use it regularly.
this is its specific name - not to be confused with regrepair or any of the others that cnet has that will allow download and run but only find the problems and not fix any till u pay up.
plus - ccleaner - this is a fast pgm that will get rid of spy cookies and will partially clean the register.
a free download.
i have never used pc relocator so i dont know what its capabilities are - actually - never heard of it either hahahaha guess i will have to check it out.
the biggest question (just thought of this) what type of hard drive does your motherboard support.
?
?
standard ide or is it sata capable??
you will need to know that when u order an internal drive.
the difference is visable by what type cabel is connected to it.
ide has a flat wide cable about 2 inches wide and the sata has a smaller cable about a half inch wide.
lastly - on the start/all programs/accessories/ menu - down near the bottom is 'windows explorer' right click and create a shorcut - then drag the shortcut to your desktop.
we will use it a lot when we get going again.
cant think of anything else right now.
hahaha that - - gets harder every year these days hahaha ted
