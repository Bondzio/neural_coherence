i am using windows 7 and i couldn't use the windows tool because i wanted to create 2 partitions, one with like 100gb in fat32 so i could use it to backup my ps3 data while the rest of the hdd in ntfs.
since there are limitations for fat32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software.
