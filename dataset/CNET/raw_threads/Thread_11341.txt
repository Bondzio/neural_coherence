When loading applications from a single disk, application installs. When loading applications on multiple disks, the software starts to load, then when prompted to insert the second disk, sometimes I can get as far as the 3rd disk, but at some stage, either on the 2nd 3rd or return to first disk to complete the loading, my computer locks up. The only way to clear it is by rebooting. If I forget to remove a disk from this drive, when I boot up the lock up occurs again, only by removing the disk and rebooting can I get the computer up and running. So far the drive has been replaced, along with the cable. Uninstalled drive, reinstalled, contacted manufacturer and received update of drivers, but still the problem exists. I have a purpose built computer with an ASUS P4S800D motherboard, Intel Pentium 4 3.20 Ghz processor. Running Windows XP home. Drive is a Lite-on DVD SOHD-167T. I can sucessfully load multi-disk applications, via my CDRW drive made by the same company. Worked when first purchased, only modification is I installed XP service pack 2. Manufacturer discounts this as they pre-tested computer installing XP with service pack 2 before erasing and dispatching to me Any advice/suggestions/solutions would be much appreciated.
