finally got the new ram, popped it in and all was good, installed windows, etc.
only game i tested so far is bf bad company 2, but it runs great on max 2xaa 4xaf, no visible lag.
the components are: msi g31tm-p21 evga geforce gtx 260 216 pentium dual-core e6700 3.2ghz g.skill 4gb ddr2-800 creative x-fi xg built this pc for my bro, tried to recycle some parts from my old pc that died, but ended up replacing everything but the case and sound card.
i was hoping the old ram would work, it was $80 for the new one.
i have a better one with an i7, 8gb ram, ati 5770, and xonar essence st myself.
i was too impatient when my old pc died i went for a pre-built from my local best buy.
