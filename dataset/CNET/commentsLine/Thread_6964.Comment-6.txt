it is currently priced at $179 at newegg and i now you asked for $160 but you'll want the 256mb (the other cards were 128mb) the 256mb will help also if you are willing to go up to the $210 area i would suggest  both cards i have posted have a minimum requirement of a 350 watt power supply (which you have although if the card doesnt work you might need to upgrade to 400 watts) also make sure you have a 4-pin molex connector (both require it need to be plugged into the card for power)
