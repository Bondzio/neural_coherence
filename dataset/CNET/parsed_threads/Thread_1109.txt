<s> Hi there, I'm getting a strange sound from my CPU and it seems to becoming more frequent. </s>
<s> I'll give my system info and then try and describe the sound. </s>
<s> Hp Pavillion 754n, 2.53GHz Pentium 4, 1GB DDR SDRAM, 80GB Ultra DMA Hard Drive, 200GB Maxtor One Touch External Hard Drive, DVD+RW/CD-RW Drive, CD-ROM, HP PhotoSmart 7350 Printer, Epson Perfection 2580 Photo Scanner. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP Home-SP2 as my OS. </s>
<s> I regularly run Spybot S&D, Ad-Aware Personal, RegCleaner and eTrust-EZAntivirus. </s>
<s> The sound is like that of a VCR rewinding, very high pitched. </s>
<s> It sounds like it's out of control.My mouse freezes and the only way to shut down is to push the power button,(I hate doing that) I'll reboot and it runs fine. </s>
<s> For a while. </s>
<s> It's probally happened about 5-6 times in the past few months. </s>
<s> But twice in the past week. </s>
<s> The last time it happened (last night) a blue screen appeared when I rebooted saying that it has to do a system check or disk check, something like that. </s>
<s> Sorry I can't be more specific with it. </s>
<s> It did a scan, said all was ok then it continued to reboot. </s>
<s> I'm a little concerned and I hoping it isn't anything really serious. </s>
<s> Any advice would be appreciated big time. </s>
<s> Gary, </s>
<s> hard drives dont last forever and it seems like urs is reaching its end...however i may be wrong and it may be something else...see what other ppl post. </s>
<s> could be something stuck in a fan and causing overheat...again see what other ppl may say </s>
<s> Open the case & see if you can pinpoint the location of the sound. </s>
<s> If the cooling fan goes bad lots of bad things can happen. </s>
<s> Operate the PC without the side panel or cover. </s>
<s> When you hear the sound, manually stop the fan mounted on the processor for a split second to see if the sound goes away (should be a 3&quot; square on the motherboard on top of an aluminum radiator). </s>
<s> If that's not it, look to the power supply cooler or chassis fan(s). </s>
<s> A good prophylactic measure is to clean out your fans w/ canned air, but use short, half-second bursts. </s>
<s> And do this outside. </s>
<s> I have this exact rig and the proc. </s>
<s> fan was WAY too loud, I swapped it out for a noiseless Zalman Flower Cooler and I run it at its noiseless setting, very happy. </s>
<s> If you have any on-board diagnostics (SMART, temp probe etc) run them. </s>
<s> Could also be HDD going bad, back up like a maniac! </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> Is two years considered old for a Hard Drive or Processor? </s>
<s> I can see where a fan might wear out or begin to, but a Hard Drive? </s>
<s> Anyway, I'll take your advice and try and get an exact location of the sound. </s>
<s> By the way, if it happens to be the HD or the Pocessor, I'm gonna be back here needing help installing the new one. </s>
<s> Is it hard to transfer everything from one Hard Drive to a new one? </s>
<s> Is hard to install a new Processor? </s>
<s> Just thinking out loud. </s>
<s> Gary, </s>
<s> You really need to open case and check those fans. </s>
<s> Any fan when it fails cause less &quot;ait circualation&quot; and thus more heat build-up. </s>
<s> If allowed to continue whatever it was trying to cool will become stressed and at least become flaky or start to fail itself. </s>
<s> Thus, a case fan cause &quot;a;;&quot; componets to be stressed and a cpu fan a more direct reslut for cpu shutdown or similar as the system bios will kick-in its safety temp feature(hi-temp) and sgutdown or reboot. </s>
<s> Seriously, check the fans. </s>
<s> An &quot;iffy&quot; fan is stop&go or not fully free to move isn't worth saving, just replace, ASAP. </s>
<s> Rememeber, that a case fan if not working 100% may cause the HD to be over heated and sooner or later will fail or become corrupted. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I took the cover off my computer and was just checking it out before I shut it down for dusting. </s>
<s> (It definitely needed to be dusted.) </s>
<s> I heard a bit of a winding/squeaking sound coming from one of the fans on the back, I believe this is the case fan. </s>
<s> I have another fan next to it but that has a duct that leads to the top the large heat sink. </s>
<s> I moved the case around to get a better look and then the high pitched/winding sound started. </s>
<s> I tapped on the fan and it stopped. </s>
<s> Looks like I need a new fan. </s>
<s> Should I replace the other one too? </s>
<s> Also, any suggestions on a brand of fan I should buy? </s>
<s> I would like to get the best one for preformance and durability. </s>
<s> Gary. </s>
<s> are my favorites, might as well get the quietest one you can: www.endpcnoise.com has lots of good choices, but not the cheapest. </s>
<s> You can order online, but I prefer locally as I get it now and install it and quality is pretty good. </s>
<s> Depending on your locale, Besy Buy, Fry's, and/or Circuit City should carry fans and gosh, RadioShaft . </s>
<s> Buy a &quot;ball bearing or magnetic type&quot; fan, avoid any &quot;sleeve bearing&quot;, brand is up to you. </s>
<s> Google for online source, I beleive FrozenCPU and NewEgg are decent vendors. </s>
<s> happy USA -----Willy </s>
