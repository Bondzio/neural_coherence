Downloaded from here http://www.lexmark.com/lexmark/sequentialem/home/0,6959,204816596_1019285789_0_en,00.html You installed the Lexmark x1250 into the desktop and have it set to be able to share printing. So what I'm seeing here is the problem that was put in the Forum Sticky , about Printer Sharing on XP Vista Network(post 12). Let me know how you make out. Rick

I have tried the Vista drivers downloaded from Lexmark, still the same problem

The print adapter is hooked up to the Printer using a usb cable. It uses the wireless network and I have three laptops hooked up to this network. Installed the drivers in each laptop. Each one can print wirelessly to the printer. No host computer needs to be connected. You could get a wireless print adapter and connect it to the printer, if you really like the printer you have. You can also change printers down the road with the setup I use. Sorry to hear about your dealings with Lexmark. Rick
