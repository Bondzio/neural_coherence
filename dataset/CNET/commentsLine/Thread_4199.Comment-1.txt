help me anyone, i recently had to reformat my computer due to a serious virus and in the process of re-installing my systems i put my hp printer disc into the system.
it used to work, or should i say, respond as soon as you wanted anything to print.but since i`ve got things back and running ok the printer takes about 20 mins to print anything off.
it says it`s printing when i check the status but i can`t wait that long for stuff, seeing as it was ok before hand.
i have downloaded hp software, drivers and stuff to make it as it was but still no luck.. any ideas???
i`m desperate.. the disc i have with the software doesn`t make any difference.
both inks are low and in need of refilling, will that make it slow down?
or is it another issue?
please help wolfey
