i did consider it might be a driver issue but did not feel comfortable trolling the web looking for a needle in a haystack-correct driver.
i did check out the windows 7 compatibility center.
they listed 2039 monitors/tv's that are compatible with windows 7. they listed only 3 emachines monitors.
my emachines monitor wasn't listed.
i don't have the money to take it to a tech and have them fix the problem.
so i think i will live with the black bar on my screen since it is not really a distraction.
just thought i'd try and fix it if i could.
