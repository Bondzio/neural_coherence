make sure all the pcs are identified with the same workgroup name.
if the printer is connected to a pc (versus a print server port on the router/switch), you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected.
i used to have a router/switch with a printer port on it which meant any pc on the network could print to it at any time.
i replaced the printer and my new one only connects by usb to the pc.
i had to replace the r/s, and now the main pc has to be on for the others to be able to print.
