1.1.1	This is what first happened , I was using it and it just suddenly powered off and tried to power back on , but would only do so for a few seconds before starting the whole process again .	St
1.1.2	It started POST , but never lasted long enough to load windows .	St
1.1.3	I did some research and disconnected all RAM , hard drive , dvd rom , card reader , and tried to boot again .	St
1.1.4	Now , I get a series of long beeps and the power cycling .	St
1.1.5	Nothing on the screen .	St
1.1.6	Help .	St
1.2.1	The beeps are proper for the removed parts so do n't panic .	St
1.2.2	Since it still power cycles my diagnosis given the story so far is it 's the motherboard or the power supply with a 60/40 chance it 's the PSU ( power supply unit . )	St
1.2.3	Again , no screen and beeps is proper with those parts removed so all I can ask is for the make , model , age of the machine to help diagnose it further .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	It 's only a two or three years old - Dell XPS 410 .	St
1.3.2	So how do I figure out which part it is - I can replace either myself .	St
1.3.3	The power supply was replaced 13 months after purchase ( and after warranty ha ! ) .	St
1.3.4	At that time , it simply did n't power on at all so the diagnosis was simple .	St
1.4.1	While it 's possible it 's the motherboard the chances of a PSU is still higher in my opinion .	St
1.4.2	At the shop we would have tried another PSU in about 5 minutes as we do n't install the PSU but simply connect it up .	St
1.4.3	A tip .	St
1.4.4	If you do replace the PSU , add 100 Watts to the rating to help support what 's in the PC .	St
1.4.5	AND INSPECT the boards for BAD CAPS .	St
1.4.6	To see what to look for , google BAD CAPS .	St

1.5.1	I 'll have to convince my 64 year old mother ( who is - you wo n't believe it - a World of Warcraft addict ) to let me cannibalize her computer for her power supply for an afternoon .	St
1.5.2	Any tips on the least amount of work for me ?	Ques
1.5.3	I wonder if the cable to power the motherboard could reach into my box without me physically removing it entirely from her box ...	St
1.5.4	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.5.5	I already ordered the motherboard just in case .	St
1.5.6	If it turns out I do n't need it , I 'll just return it .	St
1.6.1	Some take me to task if I guess wrong .	Sug
1.6.2	You know why this must be a guess .	St
1.6.3	My guess is the PSU .	St
1.6.4	The least amount of work is to get one that fits , has the connectors ( do n't fret if it has ones you do n't use ) and 100 or more Watts than the PSU that 's in there .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Your system seems so typical of a failing PSU .	St
1.7.2	I agree , to swap it out as std .	St
1.7.3	procedure .	St
1.7.4	If anything else , then cost quickly comes into play , being a Dell system .	St
1.7.5	Even though it has already been done in the past , a PSU can be tasked and from wear & tear , die .	St
1.7.6	I offer this link to help : http : //en.community.dell.com/support-forums/desktop/f/3514/p/19241256/19367990.aspx As suggested adding a new PSU with greater watts than before is a must .	St
1.7.7	Most PSU 's should work if they do n't have a physical sizing problem .	St
1.7.8	I found some Dell systems are made in such a way to defeat std .	St
1.7.9	PSU 's by fit alone .	St
1.7.10	There are direct Dell replacements as well , just google for Dell PSUs , etc for hits .	St
1.7.11	But , I 'm sure a generic PSU with proper connections will do +100W more .	St
1.7.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	My computer would incessantly restart over and over again , I took mine to a nearby comp-shop and he told me the motherboard was done , something about my capacitors being blown ...	St
1.8.2	If you notice on the inside of your computer that some parts are leakage a mysterious red powder , BEWARE .	St

1.11.1	What a silly name .	St
1.11.2	But yes , that 's exactly what I had .	Res
1.11.3	The comp guys told me it would cost more to get it fixed than it would for me to get a new computer .	St
1.12.1	I bought a new PSU .	St
1.12.2	I forgot to check the specs of my original , and got 1000 watts to be on the safe side .	St
1.12.3	Turned out my original was 500 watts .	St
1.12.4	So , plenty of power I hope .	St
1.12.5	However , it 's not booting .	St
1.12.6	The fans come on for a split second , then nothing .	St
1.12.7	So , anything else I should try or do we look at the motherboard now ?	Ques
1.13.1	New PSU installed , now it tries to power on ( fans come on ) for a split second then ... nothing .	St
1.14.1	That short spin up has many causes .	St
1.14.2	Such as forgetting the ATX12V connection or an IDE drive that has failed or is plugged in wrong .	St
1.14.3	Bob	St
1.15.1	Yep , missed one of the connections .	St
1.15.2	Thought I had been so thorough , but I double checked the photos I took before undoing everything and there it was , clear as day .	St
1.15.3	I 'm all booted and typing on the now working computer .	St
1.15.4	You were right , and I appreciate all your help !	St
1.16.1	Actually , if you know anyone who was involved in TV repair or any electronics for years , I 'm sure they could tell you a thousand leaky capacitor stories .	St
1.16.2	It 's not that uncommon and I fixed radios or other electronics when I was younger , long before I ever worked on a computer and have seen many myself .	St
1.16.3	I recall being 5 or 6 and my father was a TV repair man , showing me what a leaky capacitor was , although I admit I was more interested freezing my finger with cold spray .	St
1.17.1	See post 11 and glad it 's working .	St
1.17.2	Open a new post to continue if need be .	St
