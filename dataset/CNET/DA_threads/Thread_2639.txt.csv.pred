1.2.1	http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/223993 notes where to download the driver.	St

1.3.1	i don' have any cds, which is why i'm stuck.	St
1.3.2	i've came across the drivers and they don't do anything unless i have the program installed.	St
1.3.3	giga pocket is a dead end, unless i find a torrent which i can't find.	St
1.3.4	i just need an alternative program that can do the same thing giga pocket does, which is have the program record from the AV/Component cables in my video card onto the desktop.	St
1.4.1	Try this one.	St
1.4.2	I only has one seed so I don't know if it will work -good luck.	St
