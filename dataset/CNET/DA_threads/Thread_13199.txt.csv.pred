1.1.1	I have Charter internet and I have been losing internet connectivity so I decided to go with Bellsouth DSL thinking it was Charters problem.	St
1.1.2	Well when I was ordering Bellsouth DSL online they have a tool to see if your computer meets the requirements.	St
1.1.3	My computer passed everything except networking.	St
1.1.4	I got this message (malfunctioning nic found.)	St
1.1.5	What does this mean?	St
1.1.6	Is this why I am having internet trouble?	St
1.1.7	It is a Gateway computer running windows xp service pack 2.	St
1.1.8	The computer is about 2 years old.	St
1.2.1	Why not replace it?	St
1.2.2	http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=FA331-BULK-R&cat=NET is 4 bucks.	St
1.2.3	I see them on the shelf at not much more.	St
1.2.4	Finding out why will likely take a few hundred buck trip to a repair counter.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I like to add to what Robert mentioned, if you have a build-in nic, buy a nic card then install it.	St
1.3.2	Just disable the build-in nic before so.	St
1.3.3	It's easier to replace and as it was called a bad unit, it pretty much suggests what problem you had before as that's your link to the outside world.	St
1.3.4	Rerun the test after the install and check results.	St
1.3.5	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	The technician said in order to replace the nic the motherboard has to be replaced!	St
1.4.2	They told me to back up anything I don't want to lose and they said I will most likely have to reinstall the operating system.	St
1.4.3	How do I do all of this?	Ques
1.4.4	They are coming Tuesday and I can't figure out how to backup anything!	St
1.4.5	As for reinstalling the operating system, are they talking about the recovery disks you make when you first run your new computer?	St
1.4.6	That is all I have, recovery disks.	St
1.5.1	I have a Gateway 5310s	St
1.6.1	For the 4 dollar fix you get into the BIOS, disable the onboard NIC, install the new NIC and drivers.	St
1.6.2	No one I know replaces a motherboard due to a bad NIC.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Look at these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2050400027+1162810711&Subcategory=27&description=&Ntk=&srchInDesc=	St
1.8.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2050400027%201162810711&bop=And&Order=PRICE It's the one with the 4 buck cards at the top.	St
1.9.1	I thought I was posting a link with the lowest price listed first, but now I realize that my browser cookie was determining that and not the search criteria I used.	St
1.9.2	Thanks, Bob!	St
1.9.3	Inexpensive and a relatively easy install.	St
1.9.4	Hard to beat that fix.	St
1.10.1	I know this is a late reply, but needed to as for the &quot;tech response&quot; you got.	St
1.10.2	Unless, there's some magical nic involved(i don't think so), that tech is way off on replacing nic via the mtrbd..	St
1.10.3	In most cases you can disable the onboard nic, install a new nic and go from there.	St
1.10.4	As for recovery or any back-up it just worth the money to buy a decent back-up s/w and proceed to do so.	St
1.10.5	Visit any local or online vendor and buy one.	Ques
1.10.6	Good s/w will back-up to just about any media, like CD, DVD, tape, and/or other HD or NAS drive(if applicable).	St
1.10.7	The recovery itself usually refers to the OS re-install disks, sometimes called restore disks.	St
1.10.8	tada -----Willy	St
