ok, so i am trying to figure out whether to set my internet connection through my linksys router as &quot;keep alive&quot; or &quot;connect on demand&quot;.
i had it on connect on demand but during an online game it kept thinking the connection was idle, so it would disconnect messing up the game.
so i set it up on keep alive, well it would keep the connection, but everytime it wasnt used for a few hours it would disconnect and i have to go into router settings and reconnect manually.
what should i do?
