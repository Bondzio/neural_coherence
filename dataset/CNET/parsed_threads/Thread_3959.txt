<s> I have just completed my installation of an Intel Pentium D 940 processor on a BIOSTAR P4M900M7 SE motherboard. </s>
<s> The box of the CPU shows the CPU as Intel PD 940 3.2GHZ OEM. </s>
<s> However my WINXP system info (settings/Control panel/system) shows Intel(R) Pentium(R) D CPU 3.2GHZ 1.60GHZ 1.93 GB of RAM Physical Address Extension Is this correct? </s>
<s> Is my CPU running at 1.6GHz or 3.2GHz? </s>
<s> If I am only running my CPU at half speed, what can I do to change it? </s>
<s> well i got a dual core CPu so it works at 3.2GHz yeh but it says that its 1.6 GHz so if u got a dual core cpu dont worry about it if you dont i dont know whats wrong </s>
<s> Thanks, I found the fix. </s>
<s> There is an option in the BIOS called &quot;load the optimised defaults&quot;. </s>
<s> After I click it, control panel/systems now show 3.2 GHz. </s>
<s> I guess it was set at a lower rate when it first installed and started up. </s>
<s> This may be the &quot;normal default&quot; of the BIOS. </s>
