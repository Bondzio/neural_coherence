People say Audigy 2.. but when I google for audigy 2 several different ones show up and I don't know which one exaclty would best suit me. I want it for listening to music and watching dvds mostly, but there will be gaming in there too.. Anyone have any suggestions? I need all the help I can get, I'm totally confused Thanks! Thanks!

The 3 models (retail models..)	http://www.soundblaster.com/products/Audigy2ZS_platinum_pro/ Only 3 boxes to choose from. All great stuff. Alternative with 5.1 output (IMHO) is the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz at http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/specs.asp Bob
