david, unfortunately you have run into a problem that ati refuses to deal with (or admit to).
there is an energy spike that occurs with this card during bootup that causes many newer mobo's to auto shut down.
i went thru the whole bit with an abit as8 v board and finally had to buy a different video card to fix the problem.
there is nothing wrong with your mobo.
the only fix i have heard (which isn't really a very good one) is to disconnect the secondary power cable to the video card for about 2 seconds at the start of booting up and then plug it in.
what a pain every time you start your system!!
until ati deals with the problem your 9800 aiw is going to be useless.
my best advice is to get a new tv tuner (an hd one) and avoid ati.
it sucks that i paid almost $400 for my aiw when it was newly released and like you i rebuilt my new system around the darned thing (instead of a newer pci-e system and core 2 duo cpus which my as8 v can't support).
