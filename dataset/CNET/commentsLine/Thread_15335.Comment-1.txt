i've had dell's for years and have been generally happy, but after 3 or 4 years it gets verrrrrrry slooooooow.
knowledeable friends tell me it's because the computer came with so much junk - trial softwares, ads, etc - that load everytime i start my computer and slow everything down.
i've contacted both dell and gateway and asked them if they offer a &quot;clean&quot; computer option - i'd even be willing to pay a couple of bucks for this - and they both say no, not available.
i don't get it, dell wants over $6k for the h2c and won't even provide the minimal of personalization effort to offer a clean computer.
how much do they actually make from these trial software offers from realnetworks and the rest?
it can't be much.
very dissapointing as i'll have to spend about $2k more for a overdrive or falcon, who do ship clean units.
the dell salesguy actually suggested that i erase a new h2c's hardrive and reload the os from disk to avoid these nagging and unwelcome things.
some hutspah.
just venting.
