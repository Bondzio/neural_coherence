i am currently attending school to obtain an associates degree in computer networking.
i have been asked to design a home wireless network.
here is my situation i use hughesnet for my internet service provider not by choice, as i live in the boonies and it is my only option.
we do not even have a dial-up option.
so my question is what is the best scenario to use for my home wireless network?
