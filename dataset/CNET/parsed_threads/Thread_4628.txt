<s> I installed a new hard disk and wanted to go with a clean install of everything due to a couple of simple program problems, so I did not just copy everything from my old disk over to the new disk. </s>
<s> I copied my window 98 folder (which had a copy of my 98se in it over) from my old disk to the new disk and then ran setup, this way both disks have the exact same operating system. </s>
<s> When I boot from my old disk everything is just fine, modem works great, but when I boot from my new disk everything is great except for my modem. </s>
<s> I have a Creative Labs Modem Blaster Flash 56 PCI DI5 (DI15630-3). </s>
<s> The instll new modem does not find the modem, I have copied files from old disk to new one, down loaded new drivers but I still can not get the modem to work. </s>
<s> On the old disk the modem is set on Comm 2 but I can not get the new disk to search for a comm 2 on my computer. </s>
<s> I have searched all files and settings that I know of on my old disk to copy to the new disk but nothing works. </s>
<s> I am completly lost. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out. </s>
<s> No mention of the make/model of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Some require motherboard drivers that ... Microsoft will never do for you. </s>
<s> And I can't comment further since you ignored the forum tip. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You said that you can not comment further since I ignored the forum tip. </s>
<s> Which tip are you talking about and where is the tip. </s>
<s> Sorry ! </s>
<s> I have read over the other messeges and things were just a little different. </s>
<s> My thought is that there should be a way to copy the driver and setting for the modem from the old disk to the new disk. </s>
<s> Is it possible to find these somewhere or is this a situation that I have to install a new driver and have it detect the modem. </s>
<s> It is strange that using the old disk the modem works fine but using the new disk it just does not work. </s>
<s> I do not think it is a motherboard problem but I may be wrong. </s>
<s> Any idea's ? </s>
<s> or if my thinking is wrong let me know that too. </s>
<s> I will get the motherboard info. </s>
<s> and post it as soon as I can. </s>
<s> There are connections plugged into both the comm1 and comm2 ports on the motherboard but under the device drivers it shows comm1 and lpt(printer) ports. </s>
<s> This is the same when using either disk to boot from. </s>
<s> I have been changing the Master/slave jumpers to switch back and forth to boot from one disk or the other. </s>
<s> Using the old disk the correct modem shows up and shows it is on comm2 under device manager. </s>
<s> I used the install new modem when I set this up about 4 years ago. </s>
<s> Now when I try to use install new modem it will only look at Comm1. </s>
<s> I hope that you can follow what I am saying if not I will rewrite it. </s>
<s> I have tried to install a different modem but that did not work either. </s>
<s> I have also looked for the modem.sys file but can not find it. </s>
<s> I finially got things to work. </s>
<s> It only took a little over a week. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
