This is how you would use an alternative board. If the video chipset has become defective and no other problems are noted, you should still attempt to disable the function in the BIOS. Then, you will be limited to what's available in the way of PCI video cards. If this is an old board, you might be able to pick up a used video card to save a bit. Good luck.
