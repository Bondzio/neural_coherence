Remove the old one first in Control Panel, System, click the Hardware tab, Device Manager, Click the + sign next to Modems, right click your modem and click Uninstall. Power off the PC and remove the modem. Power back up and make sure it boots ok. If so, follow the new modem installation instructions.
