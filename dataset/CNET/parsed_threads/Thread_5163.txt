<s> Ok so I was wiping 2 drives on 2 different computers Both 7 passes, I have another 3-4 hard drives I have to do My question is what if I were to do 1 pass SEVEN times, will that be considered &quot;7 passes&quot;?! </s>
<s> What if I were to do TWO 3 passes, would that equal 6 passes? </s>
<s> I don't see any error. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Even a single pass is more than sufficient unless you have access to a billion dollar forensics lab. </s>
<s> Why so many? </s>
<s> I have always done 1 pass and it did the job. </s>
<s> On top of that repeated passes on large HDs do take time. </s>
<s> The military(DoD) spec is 5 passes, FYI. </s>
<s> There maybe others suggesting more, but intense 1/0 writing can tax a HD so be careful, you may actually break the HD under intense usage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thanks for the reply guys, I let it finish and it said Did it actually finish or did it fail? </s>
<s> what does the error mean? </s>
<s> Dban succeeded All selected disks have been wiped. </s>
<s> -pass scsi disks 465gb -error /dev/sda (pocess crash) press any key to continue then it goes to that usual red and white page </s>
<s> I see open discussions on that at https://www.google.com/search?as_q=error+process+crash&as_epq=dev+sda </s>
<s> If I remember right, I've always done DBAN on 1-HD installed in the system. </s>
<s> Disconnect all others and if this is the actual 2nd HD, make solo as if only on port 1, etc.. </s>
<s> Doing so, helps defeat the error popping-up but I urge trying this before trying anything else. </s>
<s> Plus, the error probably is more of a procedural one than a h/w fault. </s>
