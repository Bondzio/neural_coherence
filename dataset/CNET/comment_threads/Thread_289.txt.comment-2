Presumably you are fighting your way through XP's Add A Network Place enigma.
Sometimes it works instantly even without the complete computer name, sometimes it just refuses to work unless everything is just so.
How Microsoft imagined that the average consumer could use this is beyond me.
I would suggest that you check that all firewalls are off (especially if your have 3rd party ones).
Don't attempt to set up wirelessly -- use ethernet cable between the computers until things are working.
Try running the Network Wizard on the new machine.
Other than that just stick at it and eventually it will work.
