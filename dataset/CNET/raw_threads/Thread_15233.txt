If plugged into the MB on a special connection for controlling speed based on CPU temperature the fan speed can increase or decrease depending upon what processes are taking place. Is this what's happening?

Without that .... it's really difficult to tell what component or components are generating the noise. It could be the CPU heatsink fan itself, the video card fan, the power supply fan or a case fan.

4336	6	378861	3225495	3225462	Steven Haninger	1/18/10 12:53 PM	1.26381918E12	Start by describing the noise	and exactly where you hear it coming from. A CPU has no mechanical parts and no transducers that would make noise. Actual noise from a CPU could only be its death knell while crackling and hissing from heat. You could be hearing heat threshold warnings from the MB which are often BIOS configurable.

4336	8	378861	3225559	3225499	Steven Haninger	1/18/10 2:51 PM	1.26382626E12	Ok, maybe we have a terminology issue here	A CPU is the &quot;central processing unit&quot; which is a usually a small flat square sandwiched between its motherboard mounting and the heatsink/fan assembly. I've heard folks use CPU to mean the entire box to which mouse, keyboard, monitor, etc., is attached to. Is that whole box what you are calling the CPU? If so, I could guess the noise comes from your hard drive but they generally are not that loud. When you run a program, the hard drive is being accessed and will make some noise. I'm presuming you've already opened the case and stuck an ear to the interior to listen for the noise. I could offer that I've sometimes used a cardboard tube such as from an empty roll of paper towels or such to help me isolate a noise. Stick it up to your ear and listen around in the case but don't let anyone see you doing this.

Noises generated at temperatures cross thermal thresholds are well documented. These noises will come from a transducer on the motherboard or maybe even monitoring software through your speakers. Such noise is triggered by and not made by a device that's too hot. You'd first look for such in your BIOS and then check to see if you have software monitoring temperature. If your temp is ok, the threshold might just be set low. That's about all I can offer.
