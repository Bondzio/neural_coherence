review the audio driver at  (v6.0)&menuid=35&lanid=0 then see if there is a speaker type on the audio control panel.
also that all settings are pushed up and not muted.
if that fails, disable the onboard sound and install a pci sound card.
sorry, i'll skip noting trying other speakers or which plug to put the speakers into.
also will skip noting about using amplified speakers.
