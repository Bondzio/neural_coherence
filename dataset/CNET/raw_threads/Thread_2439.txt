What I would like to do it get Blue Ray dvd's onto my computer and then stream them onto the television with an hdmi cable not the vga. The only upgrade I think I would need is a new graphics card with an hdmi out port I believe. What is a good card that will get the job done without breaking my bank. I do play games as well but I am not worried too much about an awesome card just one that will get the job done. Right now I am using a Nivdia Geforce 7600 GS: http://www.nvidia.com/page/geforce_7600.html Would this card work in my system?: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4843015&csid=ITD&body=MAIN#detailspecs I know it is PCIe 2.0 but would that still work even though my old card is PCIe? Also can anyone clarify what an input on the tv means. It says HDMI1/DVI and right above that there is a DVI Audio L/R

I'll keep to to short &quot;there should be no issues.&quot; But I'm a little concerned in that you may be going down in GPU performance. If you were looking at the GT 220 or GT 240 you would be stepping up and getting HDMI too without running into power supply upgrades. Bob

Proffitt I have looked into the GT220 and 240's and have found this card: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5507336&CatId=3669 It looks good and the price of it seems right, would this card be capable of running 720p movies on my 32&quot; screen without a problem?

Proffitt	2/18/10 3:37 PM	1.26650742E12	I just installed this GT 240 2 days ago.	http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-nVidia-Express-Graphic-ZT-20404-20L/dp/B002X7A6N4 It's a little less than your GT 220 and why I picked is for the fanless design. It's silent. I also put my HP d4999t on the P3 WATT METER and the entire system tops out at 120 Watts so this means the stock 325 Watt power supply is not stressed. Hope this helps. Bob PS. I run 1080p pictures on mine.
