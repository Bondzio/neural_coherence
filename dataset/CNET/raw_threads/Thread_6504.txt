I had to install win 2000 for job purpose. Now I cannot find the driver for the Ethernet controller (Marvell Yukon 88E8036 PCE-E fast Ethernet Controller) anywhere. Called Toshiba and they don't support it for win2k. Checked on Marvell website and they don't seem to have it either. Laptop also has 1394 Net Adapter which is also without driver. Could anyone pleas direct me to the right path...Thank you..

TWhen a new device is developed, they do not always write drivers for older OSs. You should be able to find a PCMCIA ethernet adapter for which there is a Win2k driver -- if you have that slot available. I would expect, however, that a driver could be found for your firewire. After all, that was around when Win2k was a pup. Hope this helps Frank

I put an old 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot and the network came up correctly the first time still using the xp home edition. It took me about 3 hours of searching the net for the driver before finding this formun entry. Now if I can only get Ghost to work using the 3COM card in the PCMCIA slot (different problem), I will be happy and can migrate back to W2K. Even if I do lose a couple of ports... Al
