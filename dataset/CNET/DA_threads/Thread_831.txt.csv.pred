1.1.1	Not sure what causes this.	St
1.1.2	I have an abit nf7s2.0 mb, 512mb 2 hard drives, xp 2500 processor.	St
1.1.3	350W antec psu.	St
1.1.4	A couple weeks ago, the computer started making weird noises, like clunking sounds, after it shut down windows xp.	St
1.1.5	I haven't made any hardware changes, no lightning storms recently or any real obvious changes to the machine.	St
1.1.6	Its worked fine the past 3 years.	St
1.1.7	I was thinking it's the psu, but all the voltages look acceptable when checking the bios.	St
1.1.8	Boots ok, will go to s1 standby ok and wake up, checked the smart on the drives, they both passed.	St
1.1.9	looked at the mb no leaking caps.	St
1.1.10	All the connections seem ok.	St
1.1.11	The thing behaves as if power was bleeding off the psu to the mb and &quot;pulsing&quot; the drives and the fans until it bleeds down low enough to stop (the hd lights continue to flicker and i get a faint &quot;clicking&quot; on the pc speakers.)	St
1.1.12	Any suggestions on where to start troubleshooting?	St
1.1.13	I don't want to fry something unnecessarily!	St
1.1.14	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Get your flashlight and start here.... http://www.badcaps.net/ VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	The system when shutting down does &quot;house keeping&quot; chores in order to better keep track and *cleanly* shutdown pgms..	St
1.3.2	If you never did use any pgms.	St
1.3.3	that in general do all this while system is in use or you manually, then expect a longer shutdown even if no logo is shown.	St
1.3.4	This does however exclude any possible h/w fault.	Ques
1.3.5	If the HD itself is starting to falter it maybe in early stages and recovering from soft errors but finally gets the shutdown done.	St
1.3.6	The fan simply is running because power is still present and cooling is required.	St
1.3.7	In 3yrs.	St
1.3.8	if you hadn't already clean the system of dust bunnies.	St
1.3.9	Use the HD makers own diags.	St
1.3.10	to test it, get at support website for your model HD.	St
1.3.11	As for standby and hiberation modes you may want to disable so no XP setting effect that at least during your testing.	St
1.3.12	The sounds, just follow your ear, maybe a fan is getting flaky or starting to fail.	St
1.3.13	As always, do a back-up while you can or at least for important data.	Ques
1.3.14	Again, 3yrs.	St
1.3.15	is a wear%tear period when something may falter, so leave open case and see if heat is an issue too and problems seems to go away during that time.	St
1.3.16	Look into that... tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	Thanks, Definitely not housekeeping, its easy to tell when its doing that, and this is not shutdown program cleanup stuff.	St
1.4.2	When you flip the switch off and then on on the psu, it runs the fans/drives for like 30 sec!!	St
1.4.3	When I first built the thing, it would kick the fans for about 1/2 second, 30 seconds is not normal.	St
1.4.4	Now, the mobo leds blink, the lan lights blink, everything looks like its getting repeated momentary power.	St
1.4.5	I looked at the caps, they all look ok. no bulging or tilting or leaking, even on the video card, modem (yup, good for faxing).	St
1.4.6	When the computer is shut down, it just pulses power.	St
1.4.7	I started disconnecting power to each hard drive and turned the hard switch on the back on to see if it bled/pulsed power.	St
1.4.8	Then the dvd drives, then the floppy, then pulled the graphics card then the modem and then the case fan.	St
1.4.9	All that was left was a psu, mobo, and processor.	St
1.4.10	powered up and the led's on the board flickered and the fan on the processor/psu spun and slowly (60 seconds) came to a stop.	St
1.4.11	I pulled the power connections off the mobo (figured I've been beating the crap out of it enough) and flipped the psu on.	St
1.4.12	The fans spun and slowly came to a stop (60 to 90 sec).	St
1.4.13	Hmm, bad psu?	Polite
1.4.14	I checked the 12v going to the board with an auto circuit tester (just a 12 v lamp and a couple of probes.	St
1.4.15	The power going to the board would flicker about 2-3 times/second!!	St
1.4.16	Guess its a bad psu.	St
1.4.17	Anyone ever have one die like this?	St
1.4.18	Works fine as long as its NOT shut off??!!??	St
1.4.19	Anyways, going to get a new one and start there.	St
1.4.20	Thanks for your time	St
1.5.1	The ATX type psu is a &quot;logical&quot; power circuit loop.	St
1.5.2	That simply means there's no direct on/off to direct power as would have been for older AT type psus.	St
1.5.3	Swapping the psu is the next step but beware that a 2nd half of the problem maybe the mtrbd.	St
1.5.4	as well.	St
1.5.5	The start ckt.	St
1.5.6	for on/off cycle may have been damaged for whatever reason.	St
1.5.7	I would however, reseat the actual on/off harness for the frt.	St
1.5.8	panel.	St
1.5.9	I have found bad frt.	St
1.5.10	panel on/off sw.(rare it seems) that have weaken contacts and/or broken int.	St
1.5.11	contacts.	St
1.5.12	Remove the harness to on/off pins at mtrbd.	St
1.5.13	and see if problem changes.	St
1.5.14	Only a monetary contact with same pins provide the initial on/off start/shutdown.	St
1.5.15	Look around closely the immediate area of the pins the componets for obvious damage that suggest the start ckt.. Last, in your bios, if applicable there maybe a &quot;time frame&quot; of on/off action, most default to 5-6sec.	St
1.5.16	but can be longer(verify it), changed somehow?	St
1.5.17	I hope this helps.	St
1.5.18	tada -----Willy	St
1.6.1	Yeah, I pulled the pins for the front panel switch, flipped the ps on and had same behavior.	St
1.6.2	There's nothing around the pins to suggest damage.	St
1.6.3	Its a normally open contact i imagine, so if it was that switch getting &quot;stuck&quot; on, it should have behaved properly.	St
1.6.4	I still think the PS ate itself	St
1.7.1	Well, I replaced the PSU (a lot more involved than just 4 screws and some cables) and that seems to have done the trick.	St
1.7.2	I guess the on/off logic on the old one went kaput after 3.5 yrs of service.	St
1.7.3	Thanks for the help though.	Ques
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	I've had the same problem happen to me, but the pulsing lasts much longer, (generally would pulse all day and all night after shutdown if I didn't shut off the PS's power switch.)	St
1.9.2	I too had not changed the PC's configuration and checked to see if a cap had blown or if something else was amiss with the MoBo.	St
1.9.3	I found nothing.	St
1.9.4	I have an AMD 3200+ w/ a Soltek MoBo, 2GB of memory, two WD IDE HDs, NEC DVD/RW drive, ATI AGP graphics card, Soundblaster live PCI card and a USRobotics 56k modem card.	St
1.9.5	It has held it's own for several years now without an issue, until a month and a half ago when the pulsing started.	St
1.9.6	All diagnostics show there is no problem with the CPU or it's components.	St
1.9.7	The one thing you and I have in common is an Antec 350W PS (model:SL350S) which came standard with my Antec Solution Series SLK3700-BQE case.	St
1.9.8	After reading this thread, I'm going to follow through with my initial thought and replace the Power Supply and see if that fixes the problem.	St
1.9.9	I hope you have continued success after replacing your Antec 350W power supply which solved your problem.	St
