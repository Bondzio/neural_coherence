hi i'm looking into doing precisely the same thing ... trying to get a dvd burner into my mac mini.
it's not difficult!
1. ebay has lots of the right dvd burners for sale ... they are new ... just do a search (i'm tracking several of these right now and will probably go for the pioneer since i've got pioneer dvd burners in all my macs and they work beautifully).
2. make sure you're comfortable with opening the mini and working in tight spaces (i cut my teeth on mac se's and se/30's so i'm quite comfy with this).
to prepare myself for this, i took it apart and replaced the ram in my mac mini core solo.
this is different from the mac mini powerpc version ... the ram is more difficult to get to in the intel mini's!
there is plenty of help available on the internet on how to open the mini and how to get to the various parts.
the optical drive has an interface card attached directly to the back.
this interface card plugs into a slot on the motherboard.
as long as you take care when taking the machine apart and putting it together again, it is not difficult to replace the optical drive.
just take your time and don't be distracted by anything else.
good luck!
