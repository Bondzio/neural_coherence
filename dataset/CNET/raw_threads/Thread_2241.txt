I have been researching on the internet; I have an iPod touch 5g, and was looking at some ipad models, but they are too expensive. I see the blackberry playbook is under $150, and looks to have favorable reviews. I would be a casual user, using it for web browsing, etc., so 16gb would be fine for me. Besides performance, apps running smooth, etc., the most important feature to me is battery life. I hear the playbook may not have the best.
