I did a one for one swap. The motherboard had a 24-pin slot so I used all 24 (old PSU only had 20). I put in the 4-pin cpu connector on the MB too. I put an 8-pin PCI-e connector in the PSU for when the card comes tomorrow. I also put 2 connectors into the HDD/SATA ports that had the molex adapters. I plugged one into the hard drive and one into the CD Drive. I turn on the computer and the hard drive works fine. However, there is now a protected Q: drive that says it is loaded with Microsoft Office Click-to-run 2010 and is 0 bytes in the properties summary. There is no CD Drive now even though the drive physically opens and closes, and the HDD light flickers when I put in a CD. The problem is, no optical drives can be found on my computer, and I have this pesky Q: drive that isn't real.

If so, then use it is connected or swap to yet another one test out on the PC. It should work, there shouldn't any conflicts that I know of, unless that adapter is diferemnt from what intended. Nowe the connectors that ypu used to the mtrbd. should all done right, in other words no extra one until the video is instaklled. I suggest you unplu azny unneeded ones even if a place is present for its use. That way you eliminate the use of any until needed or presents a problem, just plug one in att ime. I aslso refrain from any guesses here, be sure what is required at each plug-in.Teh CD drive shouldn't have jumpedfrom a Q one as the change was only a PSU as I understand it. Check out that out and report back. tada -----Willy
