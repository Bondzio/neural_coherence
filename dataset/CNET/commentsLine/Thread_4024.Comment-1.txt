it has been a while since last i bought a new desktop computer.
i have started researching, and found there have been a lot of changes in technology since my last purchase.
i am pretty well settled on an intel e6600 cpu with a gigabyte ga-965p-ds4 motherboard.
this board has pretty well everything i want already onboard, except a graphics card.
this is where i am bogging down in my search.
i had intended to keep my nec 1800 lcd monitor, and just upgrade the processor box.
however, now i am having second thoughts.
the ga-965p-ds4 motherboard has these newer pcie slots, which to my understanding are a replacement for the older agp slots and cards.
but i am not sure which pcie video card to get - and i am not sure if they are available to feed my old analog lcd monitor, or if they only come with a digital interface (which will force me to also buy a new digital interfaced monitor).
i am not a gamer, but i do want one of the fastest systems for digital photo and video editing, as well as running adobe's creative suite of applications; i find that my current system just does not have the horsepower to drive these programs efficiently.
i also want a system that will be ready for windows vista when it eventually ships; my understanding is that it will need considerable horsepower and also a strong video card with 'pixel shading'.
so, my question is: what would be a good recommendation for a video card for my new system, and do i need to get a digital monitor, or is there a pcie card that has analog output?
or should i go with a digital card and new monitor - is there an advantage?
btw.. i notice many of these newer video cards support dual monitors.. this is not a feature that i require, and don't wish to pay extra for it.
finally, i would also appreciate some links to sites on video cards - reviews, recommendations, etc.
thanks!
