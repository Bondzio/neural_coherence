Thanks alot.
I just had my first day of High School here and I'm in the IB program there.
Some real big program.
And from what my teachers said today, we'll have plenty of writing things to do.
So I'm trying to decide if a laptop would be better or not.
What ever I buy is going to last for about 3 years, until I get out of High School, so for now the iMac might be better, then a few years from now get the laptop.
I trying to think of a way to earn something like $200 a month, so buy the time I get out of High School and into summer I'll have enough money to buy my new Mac, or maybe even before then.
Thanks and keep the info coming.
