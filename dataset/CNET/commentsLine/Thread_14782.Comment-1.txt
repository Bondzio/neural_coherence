need suggestions.
have a friend who's in love with the apple 30&quot; display, but hates the mac.
looking for a new off-the-shelf wintel system that can run that monitor.
he does a lot of video stuff, and really likes sonys.
would prefer not to buy dell.
i'm having problems finding any windows boxes that come with a capable video card.
need help with options.
again, can't build custom, need to just buy it and fire it up.
cost really isn't much of an issue - the monitor's around $3k so i'm sure he can afford the same on the pc.
oh, to have these kinds of problems... thanks for the help.
