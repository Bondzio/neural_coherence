the internal sound on my g4 sawtooth is inadequate (in fact, almost inaudible) now.
i have a couple of little aiwa speakers that my daughter left behind when she went into the wide world, and they can plug into the computer, but they don't always work very well, and i was thinking of getting some new ones.
my needs are modest: i want to be able to hear the sound on videos and the rest of normal computer sounds (such as voices).
it would be lovely to listen to music, but since i have a nice couple of speakers on my stereo and no ipod (and i haven't yet listened to music on the computer), i think that something pretty basic in the speaker line would do for me.
i am very willing to try to find such speakers myself, but i tried the peripherals forum, and it all seemed to be about pcs; also cnet's speaker reviews and found only one that explicitly said it was mac-compatible.
can someone either recommend speakers to me or lead me to the terms i need to use to search the reviews and the peripherals forum?
i seem not to have hit on the right way to search for the speakers that would suit my purposes and my ancient computer.
i don't want junk but don't need the very best, either.
i had been hoping to catch the sales on computer equipment happening at a few stores tomorrow (monday), but i'm sure it's more important to me to do some research and get what will work well than to rush into the purchase.
thanks for any tips, jenny
