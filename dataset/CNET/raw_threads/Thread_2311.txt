Address: Buckley's Road and Linwood Ave, Christchurch, Canterbury New Zealand Look carefully, there is not even a house number. Then, their USA address at LA is also not real. 122 W. Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, CA If you GOOGLE map it, you will find both are not real store or company, just cross section of roads. In addition, people have problem with them for PAYMENT !!! Once they obtained your credit card, they use it to threat you to send money as GIFT via PayPal. NEVER NEVER NEVER send money via PayPal as GIFT. If it is GIFT, it means you are giving it away for FREE. Then, you will get NOTHING back.
