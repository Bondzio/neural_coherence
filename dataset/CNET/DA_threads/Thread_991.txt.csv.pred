1.1.1	I have a 250 GB Lacie external HDD that has died and I would like to replace the dead hard drive with a new 320 GB HDD.	St
1.1.2	I removed the dead drive from the enclosure and connected the new EIDE WD Caviar hard drive (same brand and model as the original 250 GB drive), but the computer isn't recognizing the drive in the Computer window.	St
1.1.3	One time (after adding the little thing to the slave setting I believe) the computer recognized it and installed drivers, but still didn't show up in the Explorer.	St
1.1.4	I doubt this is an issue, but I also have a 500 GB Lacie external hooked up as well, which is working.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	No I did not.	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the help, it's working now.	St
