i can promise you john, you will not find the processors used by mass producers on the processor manufacture's website.
they are produced at a certain price for a certain mass production pc manufacturer and often lack standard performance features.
i am trying to buy a new computer right now, but the mass vendor always seems to have their own version , made for them, of any amd processor (and intel).
you have to look real close!
