The 2 cards I was trying to show are a Sapphire 590L or a Powercolor R38-PD3C.
Both are ATI Radeon X600 Pro, 256MB DDR, 128 Bit Cards from Newegg.
The Sapphire Card is $128 and the PowerColor Card is $144.
A PCI Express is much better than a Standard PCI card or even better than AGP cards, so they say.
