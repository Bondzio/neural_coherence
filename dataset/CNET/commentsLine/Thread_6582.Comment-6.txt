and if you can wait 'til january 07 for the new system ... you could get a dual core 64 bit cpu and windows vista..the ms 64 bit os.
by then there's a good chance adobe will have a 64 bit ver of photoshop too.
and you won't need to spend $3k to get a well configured, robust, high performance system unless you go to the bleeding edge with the latest and greatest.
