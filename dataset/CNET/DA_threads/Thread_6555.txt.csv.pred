1.1.1	I have 3 Macs connected wirelessly to an Airport Express .	St
1.1.2	In the past few days the wireless signal to all 3 Macs has dropped twice .	St
1.1.3	In other words , although there was a steady green light on the Airport Express , there was no signal indicated on any of the Macs .	St
1.1.4	After power cycling the Airport Express & restarting the Macs , the signal was re-established .	St
1.1.5	Please excuse the lengthy explanation , but I am trying to see if I am on the right path to resolving this .	St
1.1.6	A tech at my broadband ISP confirmed that there was no problem with either the incoming internet line nor my cable modem .	St
1.1.7	So the problem seems to likely reside downstream from the cable modem to the Airport Express .	St
1.1.8	I have a VOIP phone device connected between the cable modem & the Airport Express via ethernet cable .	St
1.1.9	However , I have been advised by a knowledgeable person that even if the VOIP device was faulty , the Airport Express should nevertheless still transmit a wireless signal ( of course there would be no internet connection ) .	St
1.1.10	If this is true , it would suggest that the problem stems from the Airport Express itself .	St
1.1.11	Is this reasoning make sense ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thank you for your patience & any help .	St
1.2.1	We are dealing with wifi which can be interfered with by external sources .	St
1.2.2	To expect it to never drop means that the discussion about what wifi is needs to start .	St
1.2.3	And , I ca n't find your router settings .	St
1.2.4	Please try the forum suggestions .	Sug

1.3.1	I am simply trying to validate the following suggestion : Since an Airport Express transmits a wireless signal , regardless of whether the VOIP device or any other device upstream in the chain is faulty , the Airport Express will continue to transmit .	St
1.3.2	Of course if there is an interruption in the incoming internet pathway , the transmitted Airport Express signal will not allow the computer to connect to the internet .	St
1.3.3	If this is reasonable , it would suggest that since my computers are sporatically not receiving a wifi signal at all , the problem would reside in the Airport Express itself .	St
1.3.4	Bob , you mentioned trying the forum suggestions .	St
1.3.5	Could you please point me in that direction ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thank you .	St
1.4.1	Is in the top posts called stickies in this forum .	St
1.4.2	I think you have a good handle on the problem .	St
1.4.3	If you ca n't connect to the wifi router ( this one is an airport ) with any machine then it 's the airport with some 98 % certainty .	St
1.4.4	I take out my spare router for the final test as sometimes you find the owner has repeated the same mistake on all machines ( too many to list here . )	St
1.4.5	The old HIDE THE SSID issue is coming back to haunt owners again .	St
1.4.6	This old advice is making my friends lots of money as they make house calls to unhide the SSID .	St
1.4.7	Sometimes you wonder if there is a reason for the bad security advice .	St
