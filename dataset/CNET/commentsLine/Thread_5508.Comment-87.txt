i tried to open mine after not using it for a while.
it did not prompt me for a password or anything and acted much like yours, in essence blank... i right clicked on the icon in the system tray for the wd smartware and it offered an unlock option, thinking i may have locked it, i tried it, and the drive was perfect.
not a problem... all 1.5tb was ok.... so, just a thought.
