<s> Actually this is the second modem I've tried to put in this machine (an Acer Aspire). </s>
<s> Both times I get the same thing, &quot;not Digitally Signed&quot; &quot;Device cannot start Error 10&quot;. </s>
<s> I have tried installing in both PCI slots, both COM ports, a Diamond and a U.S. Robotics modems. </s>
<s> I've installed the driver from the CD and installed a downloaded driver from the USR site. </s>
<s> Nothing works. </s>
<s> Both modems claim on the box to be XP compatible, but I cannot find a modem in any store with the &quot;official&quot; XP logo on it. </s>
<s> I have installed several modems in other computers before without a problem. </s>
<s> I have NOT yet called the support number (I hate that) and I do have the option of having the tech people at my wife's work do it (she works for a large computer reseller) but it is killing me that I can't get this thing to work. </s>
<s> It's just a modem for gosh sakes! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The motherboard drivers were not installed. </s>
<s> Your post is incomplete without notes about the host machine so I can't write if this is a concern or not. </s>

<s> Open device manager and click the driver signing button and set to ignore the windows signing radio button. </s>
<s> no good. </s>
<s> Hmm, where should I get that info, RP? </s>
<s> I have System Information on my HP but it doesn't seem to be there on the Acer. </s>
<s> There's a lot. </s>
<s> what do you need to see? </s>

<s> I don't want to get in beyond my depth. </s>
<s> If it were my computer instead of my son's I'd attempt it. </s>
<s> I'll make a note to them about it though. </s>
<s> The computer came back from the techs with the modem working properly. </s>
<s> They said that I had simply not pushed the modem far enough into the slot. </s>
<s> I found this hard to believe, since I inserted it into both slots repeatedly and did the same with the previous modem. </s>
<s> It realy felt like it was in there and everything looked lined up. </s>
<s> And, as I said, I have installed modems in a few other computers without problems. </s>
<s> But, there it is. </s>
