However if you want an extremly silent computer, sometimes these can be a little noisy when loading extreme amounts of data. Not too loud, because i can tolerate it. Try this one and see if it is what you are looking for: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-106-961&depa=1 Tyler
