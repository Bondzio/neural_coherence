I have the SCSI card that came with it.
So installing it isn't a problem.
I just thought the new systems came with an SCSI port.
Guess I was wrong.
When we updated the old computer from Win98se to ME I had to go to UMAX and order a new version of their software.
At that time they said they would not be updating to XP compatable.
I looked again the other day and found that they did update to XP and they have new software that should work with the scanner.
I hate to get rid of it.
It has such a high resolution (9800 x 9800) and it copies legal size documents.
