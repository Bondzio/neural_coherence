<s> Hello, I'm not sure if this the right forum, but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. </s>
<s> I work for a company that produces and refurbishes parts for a large printer company. </s>
<s> Some of our jobs involve flashing codes onto printer cpu boards. </s>
<s> This usually requires installing and uninstalling several hundred boards. </s>
<s> As you can imagine, the cables become worn out rather quickly, so we are constantly replacing machines. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables? </s>
<s> Most of the connectors are side by side (instead of stacked) varying from 4 pin to 12 pin. </s>
<s> I think replacing cables would be a much simpler solution as opposed to the hacked up splicing we've been trying. </s>
<s> All thoughts and ideas are appreciated. </s>
<s> The connectors are basically like what you find on CPU fans. </s>
<s> There are some 2, 3 and 4 pins. </s>
<s> A 12 pin resembles three 4 pins layed side by side. </s>
<s> I hope that makes sense. </s>
<s> Here's where we found POGO PINS to be kink on our test fixtures. </s>
<s> Maybe you just need your engineers to make up a better system. </s>
<s> Q. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables? </s>
<s> A. </s>
<s> Sorry, no. </s>
<s> In our world we craft such things as we are a maker of such things. </s>
<s> And no, don't ask how much. </s>
<s> We only do this for in house projects. </s>

<s> Is it possible to replace/repair the actual ends themselves? </s>
<s> Basically, the wires kink and break at the connector from all the pushing and pulling. </s>
<s> If we could remove the ends and reattach them 1/2&quot; up the wire, that might at least make the machines last a bit longer. </s>
<s> But the answer is simply yes. </s>
<s> Any engineer or tech can do this. </s>
<s> It's just a cable. </s>
<s> Make your own? </s>
