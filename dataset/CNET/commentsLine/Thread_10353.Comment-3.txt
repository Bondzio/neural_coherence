boy, how things have changed; i can't remember ever needing a laptop all through high school, and i'm only 19 now.
but yeah, if you need an inexpensive laptop then dell would probably be in your budget.
since you're not using it for gaming then 1000 should be more than enough.
you may be looking for a mac though, since you posted in the mac section, but an ibook is slightly under 1000 before tax, and will most definitly meet your needs.
