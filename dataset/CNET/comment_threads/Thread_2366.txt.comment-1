I just replaced all the ink cartridges and did all the various check-ups (head alignment, head cleaning, nozzle check) but the quality of the printouts are poor and there are many streaks throughout the page.
I keep redoing all the tests but nothing seems to fix the problems.
I just brought it home from college and it worked perfectly fine there.
I'm not sure how transporting it could have affected it but is that a possibility?
I've had this printer for two years and have moved a couple of time since and never had this problem before.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
