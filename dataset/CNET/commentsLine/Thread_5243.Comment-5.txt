while a nice video card there are much faster now.
it's only my opinion that 1gb is plenty for today.
about your hard disk.
500gb maxline pro 500 sata 3.0gb internal hard drive internal hard drive with 500gb capacity, 7200rpm spindle speed, 16mb cache buffer, 8.5ms average seek time.
beats the one you have on seek time and if your board supports it has twice the transfer rate in bursts.
