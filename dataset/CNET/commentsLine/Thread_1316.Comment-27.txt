i come from the age of separates.now days it seems there is no middle ground in the traditional audio component world.when it comes to surround sound it seems i have two choices for under $1000.00, tiny pathetic distortion generators,(miniature speakers with class 't' amplifiers) or multiple $1000.00 processors.whereas asus, for example, has a 7.1 card with extremely good specs,on paper, for under $300.00,this also applies to blue ray with pioner and lg offering offering not just playback but recording as well for well under $500.00.let's not forget hd web sites such as viemo which have a wide variety of stuff in 720p.these sites represent the future of hd and could spell doom for medium(dvd's) based distribution just as the net and mp3 is changing music distribution.
