I am attempting to connect them through a dlink switch. I can't get the computers to see or access the other computers. I have run the network set-up wizard many times. I have tried creating a new connection. I have tried with static IP and dynamic. I have gone in and enabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP in the connection properties. I have setup several other networks sucessfully and have no idea what I am doing wrong. Any help will be appreciated. Mike

Without you implementing an IP PLAN such as setting the addresses or having a router with DHCP, the networking should be less than happy. Try assigning 192.168.0.10 to the first machine, 192.168.0.11 to the next and so on. -&gt; I don't duplicate web content on how to set this. Bob

However,I thought the process of running the network set-up wizard was supposed to set the firewall properly. As fo the IP setup I have it set this way..Am I correct? Main system: IP: 192.168.0.2 Subnet 255.255.255.0 Default gateway: 192.168.0.2 Preferred DNS: 192.168.0.2 Second Machine; IP: 192.168.0.3 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.0.2 Preferred DNS: 192.3168.0.2 I have also enabled NetBIOS over IP. I am connecting the computers through a DLink switch Model DES1105. Note that this is a new Switch being used to connect the computers. Thanks for the help, Mike

Is there some router software on it? Also, I noted to start at 192.168.0.10 While I can't write everything in this small space, the reason is that if you installed some router later, starting at 10 could avoid some headaches. Your choice here. Bob

Now if the default IP address of the switch is 10.90.90.90; Should I use that as the gateway and DNS address. Also, should I use IP's in the range of say 10.90.90.* If so, should the subnet be 255.0.0.0 ?? I seem to have just enough knowlege to have gotten myself into troube here and can't seem to get out. Thanks for the Help, Mike

Trying to connect 2 computers (ultimately 5 computers)through a DLink switch Computer ''A'' is XP Pro Staic IP: 192.168.0.10 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Computer ''B'' is also XP Pro static IP: 192.168.0.11 Subnet mask: 255.255.255.o I have run the windows network setup wizard on both machines. If I open ''My Network Places'' on computer ''A'' I am able to see Computer ''B''. I am also able to access the folders and files in the shared files folder of computer ''B'' from computer ''A''. However.. When I open ''MY Network Places'' on computer ''B'', I do not see computer ''A''. If I click on ''View Workgroup Computers'' I am able to see Computer ''A''. But when I click on the Icon for Computer ''A'' I receive an error that states ''\\Computer A is not accessible....'' I don't understand why I can access one computer but not the other. Any help is again greatly appreciated, Mike

It seems you need to think more about why you put in a DNS and GATEWAY setting. Nothing in your posts suggests these are proper. Bob
