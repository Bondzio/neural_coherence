No signal on monitor	I just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, LEDs, you name it. I connected the monitor to the graphics card using HDMI to DVI respectively, and I get no signal on the monitor. The CPU LED is also constantly on red. I'm 100% certain the CPU is put in right. It is an AMD Phenom II X4 3.4ghz. Is the BIOS on the motherboard compatible with the cpu? Do I need a new motherboard? The motherboard and cpu are both socket AM3+. I'm also using an SSD, which I know is working because of the LED inside.

I can't tell but it sounds like you put it all together rather than using the bare minimum parts to get a beep or a display. Start smaller. If no display, remove parts to get just a beep. LED's mean nothing. You learn this after a few rounds.
