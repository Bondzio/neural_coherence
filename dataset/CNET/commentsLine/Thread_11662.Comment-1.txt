i am planning to buy this netgear router netgear n600 wireless dual band router wndr3400 the description of this route says i can get a combined thruput of 300 + 300 because it is a dual band now my laptop has got an intel centrino advanced-n 6200 wi-fi adapter.
the description of adapter says it works in dual band and will give me 300 max throughput.
question: can i configure this adapter in laptop to work in dual band and get 300+300 max throughput ?
