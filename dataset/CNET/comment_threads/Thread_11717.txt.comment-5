then are you suggesting that the only solution is to replace the hardware?
The connection is very stable when the computer is stationary, and continues to work again after using 'repair'.
Because of this, I was wondering if there's a software issue where the computer or wireless card doesn't manage to automatically update its connection after a shift in location, resulting in me having to do it manually.
Is there anything that I can check on to confirm with the problem is?
Such as opening the laptop etc.
