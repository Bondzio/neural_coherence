<s> My wife and I both have Win XP laptops. </s>
<s> For some reason, one day we both lost our wireless connection. </s>
<s> However, my wife's machine later was able to reconnect - mine wasn't. </s>
<s> My machine sees the wireless network, sends the key, and tries to acquire the ip from the router. </s>
<s> That's where it gets stuck. </s>
<s> The ip address never gets updated. </s>
<s> Is typical of WEP protected networks. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Change to WPA. </s>
<s> I checked the properties, it says WPA-PSK. </s>
<s> But I hadn't changed anything, and my wife's computer gets on fine. </s>
<s> Sorry if we repeat prior advice or give advice to how it is setup. </s>
<s> I can't see much detail in the posts. </s>
