I got the fact that Dell's parts are same with any other OEM computers, but how about compare with &quot;Building my own computer.&quot; If prices are equal, for sure, quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer, but how much different?
Because I also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop.
What you guys think?
