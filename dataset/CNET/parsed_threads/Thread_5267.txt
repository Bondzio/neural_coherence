<s> I have an Asus P5LD2, with a DualCore 3.4Ghz processor. </s>
<s> I bought 4x1GB PC-6400 800Mhz DDR2 ram, and a used Core2Duo E6600 2.4Ghz processor. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, turns out that my motherboard only supports this CPU, if it's rev2.0 and up, mine was rev1.02. </s>
<s> Plus, the BIOS reads the 4GB ram as PC-5300 400Mhz (HWINFO32 does show the proper info though). </s>
<s> So... not wanting to waste the new ram, and the processor was pretty cheap so, found a used ASUS P5Q board for sale. </s>
<s> Before I run into any other problems... can anyone see any potential issues? </s>
<s> Like will the Power Supply I have for the P5LD2 work on a P5Q? </s>
<s> Should the ram read at full speed? </s>
<s> Anything? </s>
<s> Just wanting to avoid a headache before it happens. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I don't know how much performance gain with the E6600 (it maybe core2duo but it's also at lower speed). </s>
<s> I probably would just save it for the next computer (using ddr3...much cheaper than ddr2). </s>
<s> Just my thinking on this. </s>
<s> Well, as per the OP... </s>
<s> I have the CPU/Fan ($25) and already bought the RAM ($30) so more just looking for potential issues. </s>
<s> Next computer will be an 8-Core Mac Pro that I'm saving up for, hence wanting a cheap upgrade vs buying a barebone Core i5 system. </s>
<s> I'll dual boot it wil OSX and Win7. </s>
<s> Right now, I'm using my PC as both a computer and running XBMC as a media centre. </s>
<s> Once I have the MAC, this will get dumped into a nicer desktop case and used for XBMC only, so, don't really need a $500 upgrade, was hoping $50 and done. </s>
<s> Just, didn't know about the motherboard needing to be rev2.0 and up, that was a kick in the pants. </s>
<s> If another $50 for an ASUS P5Q is all I need, I'll be happy. </s>
<s> That being said, I can't find info about things like power supply connectors... not sure if the P5LD2 and P5Q have the same plugs or not. </s>
<s> I benchmarked a DELL 745 which showed a good increase in performance over my PC which runs the E6600... and mine has a much better video card and ram. </s>
<s> My theory is that I'll see a decent amount of speed increase... - My video card is a PCI-e v2.0 card running in a v1.0 slot - My ram is PC6400 800mhz, reading at PC5300 400mhz - Switching DualCore 3.4, to a Core2Duo 2.4 So, hoping that there will be some increase in performance for all 3 factors. </s>
<s> Enough to hold me over until the MAC comes anyway. </s>
<s> Which may be another 6 months or so... since about $2500 used. </s>
<s> :S </s>
<s> We can't discuss OSX on non-Apple hardware. </s>
<s> Those discussions get an instant lock. </s>
<s> Love to work the other angles so start again but it's verboten (see forum policies.) </s>
