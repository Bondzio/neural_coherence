This is true however let us not forget other competitiors like IBM and VIA technologies that also make processors and have been way before AMD's time.
Yes a competitve marketplace breeds innovation at lower prices yet it also derails Research & Developement through creating a resource shift to Marketing which is typically becomes half of cost of the product.
In addition, Intel didn't need competition to drive its innovation as it was already dedicated to exponential improvements through its commitment to Moore's Law.
A mere 25 percent marketshare consisting of niche segments (ie.
gamers) is hardly a driverseat as much as a stowaway.
