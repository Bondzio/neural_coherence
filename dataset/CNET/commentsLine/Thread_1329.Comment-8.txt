experience is where the answers will be found!
so sharing is key.
it's definitely helpful for me, since rma is not an option b/c i've exceeded 30days, so i have no choice but to do everything possible to get it up and running.
based on your experience, i think i can rule out a defective mobo as the problem and focus on configuring the settings.
thanks again.
