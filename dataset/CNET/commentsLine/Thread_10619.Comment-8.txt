i ended up building a custom rig for my drives.
while it's not the most attractive thing (the drives are screwed into metal strapping that holds them in a tower) it get the job done.
if i had the time and patience, i would have built a custom wooden enclosure, complete with enough space to hide the power supplies and usb hub.
