1.1.1	Hey Hey , & lt ; div & gt ; I just want to get quick advise .	St
1.1.2	I have an old computer with the following : & lt ; div & gt ; Gigabyte GA P35 DS3 something like that 2,6 GHz Core 2 Duo Intel XFX Geforce 8800 GTS 2GB Memory & lt ; /div & gt ; to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part , so I thought I could replace the video card by maybe a GTX 260 or a GTX 460 or something like that .	St
1.1.3	What do you think ?	Ques
1.1.4	Ah , my goal is to have a few more fps in games and I do n't want to spend the money on a complete new computer .	St
1.1.5	Thanks already Tobi & lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	Video cards were asked about and the last 2 discussion appear to favor the 460 .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Your 8800 , is that a 1GB , or a 512MB ?	Ques
1.3.2	..just curious .	St
1.3.3	I do n't know , but i CAN share some experience .	St
1.3.4	I had a 400mhz , a 1.2mhz , and 2.4mhz PCs on my LAN a few yrs ago ... all were maxed with ram.I have alot of dated nvdia video cards laying around , so i eperimented.I was curious if a slow machine would benefit from a fast video card.I started with a 32MB in the 400 , then 64,128 , and finally a 256 ( all cards used the same nvidia driver so it was easy.THANKS NVIDIA !	St
1.3.5	I installed tiger woods 2003 and went to work.I figured anything above a 32 or 64 would be useless overkill on that ancient 400 , but i was wrong.The game ran smoother , and smoother untill i reached my 256 ceiling .	St
1.3.6	I still have that 1.2 , and just installed lord of the rings on it.The game demands a 1.8 cpu min , yet my 1.2 runs it smooth with a 7600GS ( 512mb ) installed .	St
1.3.7	( even though the 7600 wants a 8x AGP slot , and the 1.2 only supports a 4x ) Experiment results say fast video cards are worth it , in ANY machine.CPU 's are a distant second in comparison .	St
