<s> I'm using a Western Digital My Passport Essentials SE 1TB HDD and right now it's formatted in Fat32. </s>
<s> Before it was formatted in NTFS. </s>
<s> Both types of formatting didn't work when I plugged it into my 360. </s>
<s> The portable USB just stays gray and acts like it doesn't even see my hard drive. </s>
<s> My buddy has the exact same HDD but it's formatted for Mac and my xbox sees his right away. </s>
<s> Is it my hard drive? </s>
<s> Maybe I formatted it wrong? </s>
<s> Any ideas would be helpful. </s>
<s> Remove all the partitions from it and then create one new FAT32 partition and format it FAT32. </s>
<s> It's possible there was some remnant left over from the NTFS system. </s>

<s> Profit. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> I don't know why I didn't think to completely wipe the hard drive. </s>
<s> I had just kept reformatting it. </s>
<s> Works great now. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> And you have to wonder why the industry is still in the dark ages about this. </s>
<s> After a few decades you would think this stuff would be easy on the consumers. </s>
