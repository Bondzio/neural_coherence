replaced several psu with different wattage before and the most important is the main board power pins.
second will be the drives.
sparks that you gotten would probably be and unwanted plugging in of a line to the plug which is actually not meant for power (but rather a peripheral).
any new board will have a manual to guide you on which plug really needs to be plugged, especially, ensuring the main 16/20 pin is completely plugged.
