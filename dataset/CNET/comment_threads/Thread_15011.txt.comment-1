Using XP Pro, I installed a Seagate 160gb Sata hard drive.
When setting it up i chose dynamic disk and began format.
After formating a a single simple dynamic disk, I would like to create partitions like a basic disk but haven't been able to figure out hoe to do this using disk management.
My hope is to have three drive letters on this disk with roughly equal size.
I've read the M/S article and it still didn't help.
A straight forward how to would be appreciated.
Thanks
