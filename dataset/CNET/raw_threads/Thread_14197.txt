I am sure that we have different SSID and WEP. I am using a USB Linksys Wireless Adaptor on my Toshiba notebook and a built-in wireless network card on my Acer notebook. I have tried all different routers, such as SMC, Netgear and D-Link 624. I still can't access to my wireless network when my neighbor is up. Why can it be and What should I do? Thanks
