<s> I had an old computer that finally bit the dust. </s>
<s> The motherboard went on it and since it was an old asus, to replace it was more than enough to spur me into buying a new computer. </s>
<s> The guys down at the store I purchased it at wore kind enough to connect my old hard drive to the new computer and get Vista to recognize it. </s>
<s> My old operating system was XP SP2. </s>
<s> Anyways, I got the computer all hooked up now and can see the old hard drive with a drive letter J assigned to it. </s>
<s> I can access it and see old program files, old windows files, etc. </s>
<s> Only thing is I can not find my pictures, videos and music. </s>
<s> Under documents and settings there are &quot;all users&quot; &quot;incomplete&quot; &quot;My wifes name&quot; but not mine (which had everything on it). </s>
<s> Where did it go??? </s>
<s> Any and all help would be appreciated as there are valuable pics that I need to recover. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The Lost and Found post (link at the end) covers from free to demo to data recovery methods. </s>
<s> But all the moderators know this -&gt; &quot;We only lose what we don't backup.&quot; Where is the backup copy? </s>

<s> Did you have it as a username before the PC crashed? </s>
<s> If not, it could be your user account directory. </s>
<s> Did you check its contents? </s>
<s> Anyhow, connecting an old drive with Windows system files to a new PC via IDE or SATA is a bad idea. </s>
<s> Better to connect thru a USB converter or external USB enclosure. </s>
<s> Your files might all be gone now, or they might not. </s>
<s> Before you do more harm to the old files, try connecting the drive with a USB converter. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>

<s> Backup backup backup. </s>
<s> To be honest, probably 1/4 of the pics are backed up on my PS3 and ofcourse I was meaning to finish them..... </s>
<s> But this morning I tried something for the hell of it....and it worked! </s>
<s> I set the attributes of the whole drive to hidden and then changed it back.....VOILA! </s>
<s> There was my name, with all the subfolders inside. </s>
<s> Weird. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the replies....guess you know what I will be doing this weekend. </s>
