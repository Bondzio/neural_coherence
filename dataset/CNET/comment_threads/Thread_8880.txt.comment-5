Today your consumer machines are five year designs.
Once you get over that you understand you need to think of this as rent and act accordingly as well as maintain backups of what you can't lose.
To go beyond 5 years we'll have to implement a maintenance system that the maker cycles parts out as they approach the usual MTBF hours.
Sadly this means the cost tends to go up about 10x of what you could spend with a normal replace a machine when it breaks cycle.
