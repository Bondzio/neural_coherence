the desktop utilitie is how i monitor my temperatures as i said before, i suspect i have a sensor problem.
the temperature is not been over 63c since i installed the fan, the heatsink did nothing to reduce the temperature any further.
hopefully i'm not looking at failure down the road.
i am looking into replacement temperature sensors, just to be sure i appreciate all your help, thanks again
