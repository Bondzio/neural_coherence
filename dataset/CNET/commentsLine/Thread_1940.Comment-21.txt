i am sorry to hear that lexmark is poor quality - but that was my gut feel already.
sadly i read that lexmark got the contract to build all the dell printers.
i think i am going to send an inquiry to dell asking if they have addressed well known quality problems with lexmark printers and see what happens.
i'll look at the epsom rx models - never have tried one and have no bias at this point.
still seeking any input from folks who know!
cheers paul berry
