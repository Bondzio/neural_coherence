How you need one driver to play one game, and another to get another to work properly. Not a fun situation.

(I would prefer the 5600 since it costs less, and has VIVO)

Listing of latest AGP Video (Graphics) Cards specs as of Dec 29: http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/index.html For performance on how they rate scroll on down to near the end of the page for Benchmarks, then check out how each card comes out comparatively with the 10 different games tested with them. Like the Moderator I personally prefer Nvidia cards after reading about problems even with the newest ATI cards. JR
