<s> Hi i have just installed OCZ 2GB Kit (2x1GB) DDR2 800Mhz/PC2-6400 Memory CL4 Unbuffered ATI Certfified Dual Channel Kit And works fine but im thinking of putting another 2 gb in but ive heard that a 32bit operating system will only reconise a max of 3 gb im running vista 32bit home edition will they work or will i have to get 2x 512mb dual channel kits insted thanks chris </s>
<s> it will, to an extent. </s>
<s> You won't get 4 gigs though. </s>
<s> The system resources are why. </s>
<s> PCI memory addressing will take up a portion of what the 4 gigs will use leaving much ram with only around 3.4 or less, depending in actual use. </s>
<s> So in theory, yah, in actuality, no. </s>
<s> Vista starter is only like, 1 gig I believe but don't quote me, the rest on 32 bit should support it. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> So payoff is minimal past that point (Vista). </s>
<s> You can look up the /3GB BOOT.INI switch but this only works if the application was compiled using a very special compile switch. </s>
<s> Try it with 2GB and only go more if you can stand no payback. </s>

<s> I've got 4 MB of RAM on my Vista 32-bit Home Premium setup (a friend had 2 MB left over after a rebuild of his machine, so I figured there's nothing to lose by adding them to the 2 MB that came with the HP Pavilion m8100y). </s>
<s> The system recognizes 3.25 MB of that 4 MB, so that means 0.75 MB is not being used for anything that I can tell. </s>
<s> If it weren't free, I wouldn't have added the last MB. </s>
<s> Does the extra 1.25 MB make a difference? </s>
<s> YES!! </s>
<s> I run MS Flight Simulator X on this machine, which is well-documented memory hog. </s>
<s> The extra RAM allows me to turn up many of the reality settings, which make the simulation much more realistic. </s>
<s> I don't know what else the extra RAM can do, but it helps this game a great deal. </s>
<s> I'm sure you meant GB. </s>
<s> It's a common mistake as well as an easy typo. </s>
<s> As far as the memory goes, I would recommend 3GB of RAM for any Vista machine. </s>
<s> This way, you have plenty of breathing room for the operating system and the software. </s>
<s> Remember, you can always turn off some stuff in Vista and reclaim some of that memory. </s>
<s> Yeah, sorry. </s>
<s> I meant to use GB instead of MB. </s>
<s> And I forgot to add that I wouldn't recommend that last GB unless you can get it free, or at least REALLY cheap! </s>
<s> Getting only 1/4 of what you pay for isn't much of a deal. </s>
<s> I haven't removed the 4th RAM memory unit, but I'd bet there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between 3 GB and 4 GB. </s>
<s> I have a Dell XPS laptop with 1 GBRam. </s>
<s> Being an XPS, I am surprised at how slow it is. </s>
<s> Is this because it needs more RAM or does the system nened more capacity? </s>
<s> The 4GB limit on 32bit machines includes your RAM, video RAM and your virtual memory. </s>
<s> The .75 missing is prob 256 for your video and 512 virtual memory. </s>
<s> Vista will work with 4gb installed cause i dont think they do my memory in dual channel mode on the 512mb version or will i not notice much difference form 2gb. </s>
<s> Cheers chris </s>
<s> Since &quot;out of the box&quot; XP, Vista will only hand any application 2GB there has been little to no payoff past 2GB. </s>
<s> On top of that, even if you discover the /3GB switch it still required the application be compiled with a SPECIAL switch. </s>
<s> Your money, your choice here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Exactly! </s>
<s> 32-bit OSes like WinXP and Vista 32 are capable of allocating maximum of 2GB of RAM to an application. </s>
<s> If you need more than 2GB of RAM per app, the best solution would probably be 64-bit OS like Vista 64. </s>
<s> BTW, this thread's posts confirm previous observations of 32-bit-OS-'in-practice'-total-RAM-limit of somewhat 3.5GB. </s>
<s> It's enough to drive a programmer mad. </s>
<s> The switch is called when you link your program with the linker flag /LARGEADDRESSAWARE. </s>
<s> You betcha you better use some Microsoft tools to get that to work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There were some useful tips at CNET on how to make your machine run faster (try the 'search forums' search feature for detailed info). </s>
<s> In a nutshell, your computer 'slowliness' is not necessarily connected with its physical RAM size. </s>
<s> The first thing I check (or recommend to check) when I receive a distress call about 'slow machine' is the system's contamination with unnecessary data and the size of Windows' swap-file (aka 'virtual memory size'). </s>
<s> The former is done, for example, in Windows Explorer via clicking on your system logical disk (the one where OS is installed) with the right-button of your mouse, selecting the 'Properties' item in the list then 'Disk Cleanup' then 'More Options'. </s>
<s> It's up to you to decide what options you'd like to use cleaning your drive but personally I don't go beyond the deletion of 'System Restore' old files and those selectable at the 'Disk Cleanup' tab. </s>
<s> As for the swap-file size, you might want to attend to other CNET members' advice but I have it set to 1.5GB. </s>
<s> The result? </s>
<s> Well, it's always there! </s>
<s> The only thing my 'ol'-good-PIII-1.4GHz/0.5GB' gives me a hard time is processing FullHD streaming video files. </s>
<s> All other tasks like inet, DVD playback, office apps, DVD burning, TV etc. </s>
<s> run smoothly. </s>
<s> Of course, you can always spend some premium 'to add muscle on the machine' but why don't you try to use in full the muscle it already has? </s>
<s> Efficiency is not necessarily attained with additional money spendings. </s>
<s> Try 'system-fine-tuning' first - only if that doesn't help - go for 'muscle build-up'. </s>
<s> Obviously one app can't use all of your memory. </s>
<s> 3 GB would definitely be beneficial because Windows and background processes can use a gigabyte while letting your big app use its full 2 GB. </s>
