<s> I recently installed an old Epson 580series printer as indicated by the manufacturer's CD, where clearly states that it should be used instead the Windows wizard for new hardware. </s>
<s> Well, my PC (Win XP Pro) &quot;accepted&quot; both the drivers and the hardware and everything seemed OK, but now, whwenever I start my PC, it shows the &quot;New HArdware....&quot; window and asks for its installation. </s>
<s> I simply click on &quot;Cancel&quot; and things go normal...printer is still there and working! </s>
<s> But how can i tell XP -for good- that there's already a printer? </s>
<s> &quot;the&quot; days have gone when you install manufacturer's driver's instead of windows driver's unless they have been certified - those cd's you have probably were written with win9X in mind. </s>
<s> In short delete the driver you have - reboot and see what winxp installs for you - if you are not happy with the winXP version go to &quot;device manager&quot; and ask to update the winxp driver - then say have disk and search the cd for the *.inf files - and then force XP to accept the one from the cd (ignore it if you are told the driver was not written for your printer). </s>
<s> any problems let me know peter </s>
<s> Uninstall printer. </s>
<s> then reboot, and let Windows look for a driver. </s>
<s> If it's an older printer, chances are Windows won't find a driver for it, and will ask you if you want to install from disk, or other. </s>
<s> Then use your CD, and tell Windows to install from there. </s>
<s> This should do it for you, and Windows may be happy that it has done it's job of bugging you </s>
<s> Think you said the same thing, but better than I did. </s>
<s> Just too close to call for this &quot;G&quot; rated forum. </s>
<s> No offense please, just too close to call so I deleted it. </s>
