about all i plan to salvage from my old compaq is the case and even that will need some sheet metal work.
ever time i try and start a build (price it out) i find that buying a new os (must be real and complete) causes the price to go up to the point i can buy for cheaper then i can build it.
i usally stop and decide to live with what i have.
try here for more general info  look at my reply &quot;basic things to watch for when buying&quot;
