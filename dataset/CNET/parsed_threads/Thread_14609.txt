<s> I have an older pentium 4 computer with windows XP Pro w/SP 2, 2 ghz and 512 ram. </s>
<s> It currently has two dvd drives installed. </s>
<s> I wanted to change out one of the dvd drives for a different one. </s>
<s> So I opened he computer box, changed one dvd drive for one I had been given. </s>
<s> Closed the box, started the comptuer and did not find any dvd drives at all. </s>
<s> Thinking it would be best to put the old one back, I removed the one I had changed and put the old one back. </s>
<s> Upon rebooting the computer, I still do not have either of the dvd drives in my computer nor in the device manager! </s>
<s> I put everything back the way it was in it's origianl form, etc. </s>
<s> Can anyone help and tell me what I should do next. </s>
<s> Thank you so kindly, C </s>
<s> when you installed it ?? </s>
<s> They only work together if the jumpers are right. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> and not afterwards, it's usually something I did. </s>
<s> If returning the drives to their original positions on the cable....and shall we presume IDE?...did not work, I'd first try to check and reseat the cable(s) including the power connectors. </s>
<s> You can also try replacing them. </s>
<s> Setting the jumpers for cable select and using an 80 conductor IDE cable works best. </s>
<s> As well, interrupt the POST and see if they show in the BIOS. </s>
<s> If they don't show there, they probably won't show in Windows either. </s>
<s> to just swap one dvd drive for another. </s>
<s> Have never done this before so will need specific instructions, if you please. </s>
<s> Is there a specic order that you plug the cables in? </s>
<s> I made sure I put the cables back the same way I had unplugged them when I put the dvd drive back in. </s>
<s> There are two dvd drives sitting one on top of the other. </s>
<s> The one I wanted to swap out was the bottom one. </s>
<s> I did not change the IDE (don't know how to do that) so shouldn't the original dvd drive work when put back where it was? </s>
<s> What is the POST? </s>
<s> And could you explain how to check the BIOS? </s>
<s> If I put a dvd into either of the drives, the light blinks in the front of the drive, but nothing shows up on the computer. </s>
<s> I can hear the spinning of the dvd also. </s>
<s> There has to be something simple that I just screw up when I tried to replace one of the drives for a different one. </s>
<s> But don't understand why the same dvd drive that was in the computer to begin with won't work after being put back in it's same place? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your information, C </s>
<s> Can you see the drives in Windows Explorer? </s>
<s> If so, it's possible they aren't configured to autorun. </s>
<s> If you can't see the drives but can hear them spin, they are getting power. </s>
<s> That's a good start. </s>
<s> You said you put the old drive back in (presuming it was working) exactly the way you took it out. </s>
<s> So, what has changed is the cable was removed from the drive and plugged back in. </s>
<s> It's possible the cable got damaged in that process. </s>
<s> Replacing a cable is easy if you have or can get one. </s>
<s> I've had some problems with ATAPI devices in the past that aren't easy to explain. </s>
<s> They do have jumpers and most can be configured as either Master, Slave, or Cable Select. </s>
<s> If you are using an 80 conductor cable it's best to set the jumpers for Cable Select. </s>
<s> An 80 conductor cable will have different colored plug ends....generally blue, black and gray. </s>
<s> The blue one goes into the motherboard. </s>
<s> The black one will be for the master if the jumpers are set that way and the gray one for the slave. </s>
<s> Again, jumpers set to cable select will do that for you. </s>
<s> As for POST, that's the screen you see before Windows starts. </s>
<s> The BIOS contains your basic hardware configuration and Windows works through it to access hardware. </s>
<s> Sometimes during POST (which means Power On Self Test) you can see references to hardware such as drives. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you can interrupt the process during while it's booting and view a set of menus that allow you to see information about the hardware including hard drives and CD ROMs. </s>
<s> Generally it can even display the name and model of the drive as well. </s>
<s> It's a good place to look to see if the drive has been found and configured. </s>
<s> You may see an option during POST to press a key to enter Setup. </s>
<s> It's generally Del, or F1 but some use other keys. </s>
<s> If you can get to that, you might be able to see if the drives show. </s>
<s> If on the applicable IDE port it shows nothing configured, then Windows isn't going to see it either. </s>
<s> Anyway, my first thought is that you may have a damaged cable. </s>
<s> You've tried everything else. </s>
<s> It wouldn't hurt to replace it. </s>
<s> Got into the bios setup and am trying to do IDE configuration. </s>
<s> I have Primary IDE Master which shows - Maxtor 5T040H4 (must be the hard drive?) </s>
<s> Then Secondary IDE Master and Secondary IDE Slave, both not installed. </s>
<s> Am thinking I should enable those two with CD Rom - for the two DVD drives?? </s>
<s> Don't think it's a damaged cable (according to the cable information) it's a 40 pin. </s>
<s> You gotta know this is an older system, but it was custom built to last several years. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for the information, I really appreciate it. </s>
<s> Am I on the right track?? </s>

<s> When connecting two IDE drives (CDs, HDDs, etc.) </s>
<s> on the same IDE cable they should both be set to Cable Select (&quot;CS&quot;). </s>
<s> When using Cable Select . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> whichever drive is at the 'end of the cable' is treated as 'Master'. </s>
<s> One alternative when connecting two IDE drives on the same cable is jumpering one drive as 'Master' and the other as 'Slave'. </s>
<s> In your case, you should have looked at the jumpers on the CD you removed and jumpered the one you replaced it with the same way. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>

<s> All I did was take out one dvd drive, swap it with one that used to be in the computer (but a much slower dvd drive). </s>
<s> Boot the computer and neither drive was there. </s>
<s> Thinking I messed up, I turned off the computer, unplugged it, opened the case and put the dvd drive that was originally in there back, right to the same place with the same connections. </s>
<s> There is a power plug for each of the two dvd drives, ribbon cable for each of the two dvd drives (one ribbon goes to one dvd and then to the other), and one audio plug to the dvd drive that I was taking in and out which then goes to the motherboard? </s>
<s> Since I didn't do anything else, I thought putting everything back the way it originally was would work just fine. </s>
<s> Stupid me..... </s>
<s> I did not change any settings on either dvd drive, just unplugged the one I was swapping. </s>
<s> But when that didn't work, I put the original dvd drive back where it was, so everything was the same as before I even messed with it. </s>
<s> Any ideas here?? </s>
<s> Thanks so much, C </s>
<s> Because your BIOS said nothing was installed on the secondary IDE port, you're 1/2 way there. </s>
<s> This explains why it's not working in Windows. </s>
<s> Now we need to get the drives detected in the BIOS. </s>
<s> It could still be a cable issue. </s>
<s> First, make sure the cable is securely attached to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Carefully remove it and reinsert it until it's snug. </s>
<s> Now, because you said yours is a 40 conductor cable, we're not going to worry about the cable select jumper. </s>
<s> Plug only one DVD drive into any port on the cable. </s>
<s> Start the machine and enter the BIOS. </s>
<s> See if it detects the drive. </s>
<s> Since it's an older machine, you may find an option to prompt the BIOS to detect rather than do it automatically. </s>
<s> If it won't detect the drive, turn it off and connect to the other port on the cable and retry. </s>
<s> If still no go, change the jumper. </s>
<s> If it was master, change it to slave, etc. </s>
<s> and try again. </s>
<s> You'll need to turn the PC on and off each time. </s>
<s> If no go still, grab another drive and repeat the steps above. </s>
<s> You have 3 drives and 2 ports to play with. </s>
<s> If no combination works, I'd say you have a bad cable or have lost an IDE controller. </s>
<s> You can also disconnect the cable from the hard drive and attach a DVD device to that to see if the BIOS will detect it. </s>
<s> This will just be a matter of ruling out by trial and error. </s>
<s> I have seen plenty of cables go bad or not be properly seated. </s>
<s> I'd guess that's the case before thinking 3 drives were bad. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help and information. </s>
<s> As always everyone is great at the forums! </s>
<s> Good news, I went into the bios and set the secondary master and slave to auto. </s>
<s> Rebooted and up popped my two dvd drives!! </s>
<s> C </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> For the future please keep in mind that what I stated previously still applies...that is about jumpering IDE drives on the same IDE cable. </s>
<s> So even if you set the BIOS correctly for both drives as &quot;AUTO&quot; ...the drives would not be detected UNLESS the drives are jumpered correctly. </s>
<s> Think of it as baseball where there are two runners on SECOND BASE .... wait you can't have two runners on second base. </s>
<s> Same with IDE HDDs on same cable... they cannot function correctly when both are jumpered as Master OR Slave. </s>
<s> So for IDE drives jumpering using the same cable... both drives can be jumpered as &quot;CS&quot; OR one drive as Master and the other Slave. </s>

<s> and will keep it in mind. </s>
<s> Had read that in the booklet about the dvd drive. </s>
<s> Thanks, C </s>
