hey willy - thanks for the advice.
i grabbed a can of air from work and blew it all over the 3 pc fans and the video card.
system still runs hot (144 f right now), but 20 degrees below alarm level.
i have an alienware area-51 5100 system built in january 2004 with dual pentium 4 3.4gh processors and an nvidia geforce 6800 ultra video card.
i think it has always run a bit hot.
i am not familiar with arctic silver.
i am an old hand at replacing video cards and ram, and even a hard drive or two, but i don't know quite what a &quot;cpu glob&quot; is.
sorry for being a dork!
any advice/tips would be most welcome.
thanks, lisa
