Proffitt	7/26/04 7:44 AM	1.09082784E12	Re: hp scanjet 2300c	From memory, HP had some software to wipe out the installed scanning software and drivers so you could reinstall it as if it was a new install. They don't &quot;fix&quot; an error, but just wipe and reinstall. Unplug the scanner and do the work. bob

I offered it as a clue to try. &quot;Could you please explain the exact order of steps. &quot; No, I give guidance and direction. No &quot;steps.&quot; Steps are likely for paid support services. &quot;Should I uninstall present software?&quot; In my first reply, I noted that. Maybe I was unclear? But hopefully this time you will unplug the scanner USB connection, look to an uninstall in Add/Remove, put in the CD add it as if it was new and see if it helps. Bob

I'm still at step one, that is in Windows ME I get msxml.dll not regestered whereas in X.P. the scanner works ok. Any suggestions? I even tried to install an update for msxml and the dialogue box said That it's already installed and it wouldn't let me install.

I also noted that HP often has a &quot;cleaner&quot; software to remove the traces of the scanner software so you can start over. I leave it to you to find it. Just FYI, again, this is just someone thats done this many times and doesn't get a dime for offering direction to the issue. Sorry, no step by step. Bob

Link provided. Somewhere on HP.COM is an uninstaller if you can't do this with the add/remove tool. It's elusive, but HP does have it. Call them. Bob

When you click Find Album Info, you may receive a script error message that is similar to the following: ! An error has occurred in the script on this page. Line: 879 Char: 7 Error: 'XMLOriginalMDQ.getElementsByTagName(...)(...)' is null or not an object Code: 0 URL: http://metaservices.windowsmedia.com/CDWizardCoronaJInfo.asp?RequestId=B0EFDEDF-8620-4FD5-87A2-A7DB5219DF83&WMPFriendly=True CAUSE This problem may occur with any type of file that contains unknown file information. For example, this issue may occur in Windows Media Audio (WMA) files or MP3 files. RESOLUTION To resolve this problem, re-register the Msxml32.dll file. To do this, follow these steps: Quit Windows Media Player. Click Start, and then click Run. In the Open box, type regsvr32 msxml3.dll, and then click OK. Click OK when you receive the following message: DllRegisterServer in msxml3.dll succeeded. In short my scanner works again.
