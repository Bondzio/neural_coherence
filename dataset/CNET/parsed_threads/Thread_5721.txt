<s> Hi What's the advantage of having TV Tuner in PC? </s>
<s> I think, I would still need to subscribe to Comcast TV or DishTV to get the signals and channels I need. </s>
<s> Is this right? </s>
<s> Only thing maybe, I will not need a DVR and can use the PC as a DVR to record/pause TV programs. </s>
<s> PC does not have a wireless card, so this means TV needs to be plugged to PC directly and PC turned on each time I want to see TV or use record/pause DVR features. </s>
<s> Is all the above correct? </s>
<s> Anyone heard of Satellite TV on PC. </s>
<s> Here's the url: http://www.the-free-tv.com/index3.html They say we can watch 100's of channels for free ($67 initial fee) on PC, provided there's internet connection. </s>
<s> Is this a hoax? </s>
<s> anyone using this service? </s>
<s> How is the reception/service? </s>
<s> Thanks Rajat </s>
<s> a pc tv tuner card will pick up your analog/basic cable channels but it won't tune satellite at all. </s>
<s> some tv tuner cards can plug into your directv/dish box to control its channel selection and record from the s-video output. </s>
<s> ati has released a tv tuner product that utilizes a CableCard but it is for system builders only (not available in retail) and somewhat problematic. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2959&p=5 the-free-tv.com is not &quot;real&quot; US channels. </s>
<s> most are from european feeds and you won't find the content you expect from cable or directv (espn, usa, disney, etc). </s>
<s> If you would like to know more about Satellite and PC satellite tv, you can go to FTA which is a free to air satellite website, read the forums there. </s>
<s> You can install a PCI tv satellite card and receive satellite tv on your computer monitor. </s>
<s> The reception is extremely clean as it's digital and your monitor will make the picture better than a tv but not as good as HDTV. </s>
<s> You can find any additional help on the forums there and no question goes unanswered and is generally answered in a matter of hours, seldom more than a day or two. </s>
<s> go to newegg and search SLING thats your answear. </s>
<s> if you want to record shows Digital and otherwise directly to your PC from the Satt/Cable or Any source also go to newegg and look under Tv tuners and then Kmedia its like 39$ not bad. </s>
<s> The website http://downloadsatellitetvforpc.com has reviews of satellite tv for your computer. </s>
<s> I have Leadtek Winfast TV 2000 XP Deluxe tuner. </s>
<s> Are there any possible ways to make it work with Comcast digital cable tv? </s>
<s> I will appreciate you help! </s>
