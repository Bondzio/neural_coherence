Your issue is simply that Microsoft's XP SP2 does not install of SATA without a lot of help from the person that installs this OS. I don't tell how to install XP since there are thousands of web sites about that so let's go quickly over the basics. We boot the XP SP2 CD and have the SATA drivers handy on diskette. At some point we tap one of the F keys to tell XP's installer we will supply drivers that Microsoft doesn't put on their CD. After all that we have a working install but with out of date drivers and possibly no sound, internet or such. We get to install a potload of drivers. If this is an add on drive and not a boot drive, then you need to check your boot order in the BIOS. Bob

Google: xp slipstream sata driver - or - Google: xp unattended install sata driver ALTERNATIVES: - borrow a floppy drive just for the installation - cannabalize old computer for a floppy drive - buy an internal floppy drive (USD$6 +SH) - buy a nice external USB 2.0 floppy drive (very handy) MY PREFERENCE: Beg, borrow, or buy a floppy drive

Next year Microsoft promises to fix that but only in Vista. As to the issue of moving the OS or such, that's another lacking area. You can attempt a repair install and follow the usual steps needed to make the OS install proper. Microsoft has shown no mercy in that &quot;keep my old programs&quot; issue. There appears to be no plans for that in Vista as well. I think it's an antipiracy ploy. Bob
