1.1.11	ANY IDEAS ?	Ques
1.2.1	There are a few that connected a cable/dsl modem to a hub/switch and it might work for a short time .	St
1.2.2	Then the ISP knocks out the IP address and such may happen .	St
1.2.3	Your description of the network is too light to really tell what it is yet .	St
1.2.4	Do open a command window and try ... NET VIEW Bob	St
1.3.1	I do have a cable modem and i use an eight port switch .	St
1.3.2	Both of the computers will connect to the internet and i can see each computer from command Net View .	St
1.4.1	The standard setup is ... Cable modem - & gt ; Router - & gt ; switch and machines .	St
1.4.2	You can grouse all you want it worked before ... Bob	St

1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Since I can not get an answer from you I am now going somewhere else !	St
1.7.2	Hurray for Bob	St
1.8.1	You have to supply details and even the correct details for help forums to help you .	St
1.8.2	All you need to do is read your posts and see that the first post supplied & quot ; not much & quot ; , the second post had an error and the last post is one where you give up rather than tell what firewall you have installed .	St
1.8.3	I hope the last clue was enough for you to reconfigure the firewall which I still do n't know if you have such .	St
1.8.4	The Forum Tip helps avoid such back and forth as we dig out the needed information : Tip : If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution .	St
1.8.5	Best of luck in your endeavours .	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	people assume that troubleshooters know users ' network configurations and desktop configurations .	St
1.9.2	there are multiple ways you can setup a local area network and access the internet .	St
1.9.3	if you go to a doctor , he is going to ask you all kinds of questions about what ails you .	St
1.9.4	troubleshooters are n't any different .	St
1.9.5	we ask many question and the more details you can provide about your network , hardware and software configuration , the better and quicker we can help people .	St
1.9.6	also as you might have gathered from reading the various posts , no two troubleshooters are going to prescribe the same remedy .	St
1.9.7	some like to get into the programing side to fix things while others prefer to reinstall the whole shebang to fix it .	St
1.9.8	i belong in the latter group .	St
1.9.9	after a diagnose , i 've learned to substitute a suspected hardware with one that i know works .	St
1.9.10	if it 's a setup problem , tear it down to its simple components and then work your way up .	St
1.9.11	so if we 're trying to help you and we seem to be asking questions that you think might not be pertinent to your case , i beg you to be patient .	St
1.9.12	our work is doubly hard because we ca n't physically see your setup and most of us who work with networks are hands-on kind of people .	St
1.9.13	anyway , do n't give up too easily	St
1.10.1	let 's talk about your network setup for a second .	Sug
1.10.2	you have 2 computers and those two are connected to a switch and the switch is connected to a router .	St
1.10.3	is this a single network or do you have other things connected to the router ?	Ques
1.10.4	i 'm assuming your 're using a switch bec there are n't enough ports on the router .	St
1.10.5	otherwise , if i were you , i would just get rid of the switch and connect both computer to the router ( kiss ) .	St
1.10.6	also are the two computers hardwire or wireless ?	Ques
