even though 64 bit processors are available today the operating system to take advantage is still in it's infancy.
applications like word processing, and web browsers will not be made much faster with a 64 bit processor, but, math intense programs, like games, photoshop, video editing will be faster.
these programs are still 1-2 years away.
if you don't do any of those things 64 bit will be no advantage to you.
