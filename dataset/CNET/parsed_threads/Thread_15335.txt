<s> I've had Dell's for years and have been generally happy, but after 3 or 4 years it gets verrrrrrry slooooooow. </s>
<s> Knowledeable friends tell me it's because the computer came with so much junk - trial softwares, ads, etc - that load everytime I start my computer and slow everything down. </s>
<s> I've contacted both Dell and Gateway and asked them if they offer a &quot;clean&quot; computer option - I'd even be willing to pay a couple of bucks for this - and they both say NO, not available. </s>
<s> I don't get it, Dell wants over $6K for the H2C and won't even provide the minimal of personalization effort to offer a clean computer. </s>
<s> How much do they actually make from these trial software offers from RealNetworks and the rest? </s>
<s> It can't be much. </s>
<s> Very dissapointing as I'll have to spend about $2K more for a Overdrive or Falcon, who do ship clean units. </s>
<s> The Dell salesguy actually suggested that I erase a new H2C's hardrive and reload the OS from disk to avoid these nagging and unwelcome things. </s>
<s> Some hutspah. </s>
<s> Just venting. </s>
<s> We fill the drives up or addon new toys over the years. </s>
<s> I disagree that it's what the machine comes with. </s>
<s> There was a member that insisted the makers do a &quot;clean install&quot; for him but was unwilling to pay for the service. </s>
<s> Not much can be offered that member. </s>
<s> I find the machines as offered to not suffer so much and in less than 15 minutes I can uninstall what I don't want. </s>
<s> Why would I pay more to have someone do this for me? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.yorkspace.com/pc-de-crapifier/ as for the bundled software, dell does make quite a bit from it. </s>
<s> at 50,000 units a month, an extra $2 profit per unit is good money for almost zero effort. </s>
<s> also, you could get a business desktop instead of one intended for &quot;home&quot; users. </s>
<s> business units typically have far less crap installed. </s>
<s> Many OEM's that provide thier &quot;bundled s/w&quot; already have made prior agreements or deals to get that s/w either as a trial or basic service for the system in order to have as an offering at certain $$$ value. </s>
<s> You of course have the option of either using and becoming an end user, thus pay or buy the s/w and/or service and thus continue it use. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you can de-install as well and just be rid of it. </s>
<s> This is all an effort to get you to spend more but again the effort is lost if not ever there. </s>
<s> But again, you may like what you have and continue its use. </s>
<s> All-in-all most can be de-installed and be done with it. </s>
<s> However, most users pretty much find that out within the 1st yr. of operation or less if any is kept. </s>
<s> If you used your system for 3-4 yrs. </s>
<s> and now find it sluggist you may have other issues/problems, but again you need to review what you want to keep in the old s/w or services. </s>
<s> Then, do the typical housekeeping of the system wares and see what needs to be cleaned out and there you have to make decisions on what does this in s/w. </s>
<s> like registry cleaners, past old/new pgms. </s>
<s> never used, defrag, and pssibility your old data that can be saved offline like to CDs or ext. </s>
<s> HDs. </s>
<s> to lessen their storage needs. </s>
<s> On top of all this using AV pgms. </s>
<s> malware checkers. </s>
<s> plus active firewall, etc. </s>
<s> makes sense now ever done just to verify none is present. </s>
<s> In this regard all pgms. </s>
<s> used must be updated for best eff4ect. </s>
<s> If all of this doesn't seem to make things better and YES sometimes restarting from scratch makes sense. </s>
<s> You get to reload from a clean starting point redo the above suggestions and get a better handle on things from the git. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'm no techie. </s>
<s> I admit to being totally freaked by the notion of erasing the hard drive of my brand new machine and trying to reload the OS and MS Office software. </s>
<s> I guess I could hire someone to do it. </s>
<s> But I've also been told that these trial software garbage comes on the &quot;restore&quot; disks that Dell distributes with their units (as opposed to a brand new Windows Vista disk from Microsoft)as well, and if this is true then you don't get rid of it. </s>
<s> With my current/old Dell I continue to get ads from RealNetworks asking me to buy their upgraded package, and I don't know how to get rid of it. </s>
<s> I guess I'm just annoyed by Dell and Gateway who don't offer a clean install with their high end units that cost over $6k, without a monitor. </s>
<s> At least Alienware promises a clean install and their not tooooo much more than the equivalent Dell. </s>
<s> But Falcon, Voodoo, and Overdrive comparable units costs over $2k more than the same equiped Dell. </s>
<s> Thanks all for the advise. </s>
<s> You may consider a few programs that Dell installs to be junk or clutter. </s>
<s> I understand, but I don't think it's as bad as you portray it. </s>
<s> To me, this is like complaining about finding a few cigarette butts on an otherwise pristine beach. </s>
<s> You could hire a cleaning service to remove them, but why not just dispose of them yourself, save some money, and enjoy the beach? </s>
<s> I do see a disconnect between your complaint and the fact that you are considering high-end gaming systems. </s>
<s> If you want to maintain a gaming system and actually play games, you will have to be more of a &quot;techie&quot; than just knowing how to disable or uninstall two or three &quot;junk&quot; programs that Dell includes. </s>
<s> As for RealPlayer and similar programs, go into its Preferences and remove the 'X' next to the automatic procedures you don't want. </s>
<s> An alternative is to go to the Add/Remove Programs control panel to completely remove whatever programs you don't want. </s>
<s> Interesting article on todays and last weeks Wall Street Journal on this subject by Walt Mossberg. </s>
<s> You can't view the entire written article unless you're a subscriber, but he has a couple of interesting short videos on the subject of crap-filled new computers that anyone can view - see link below. </s>
<s> He seems to agree with my point that expecting normal computer buyers to be able or advised to wipe their hard drive and reinstall windows (assuming you get a full version disk which most like Dell, etc do NOT) is dangerous. </s>
<s> He also confirms that many of the &quot;restore&quot; disks have this junk on them, so you accomplish nothing. </s>
<s> I think this practice is going to become a big issue for computer sellers as folks find out that their spanking new Vista computer takes 5 minutes to start up, largely because of advertising and trial software on their startup menu. </s>
<s> http://online.wsj.com/public/page/1_0029.html?mod=1_0028%3Fmod%3D1_0028 </s>
<s> Pay for a clean install, learn how or select your own OS. </s>
<s> Seems clear that to go cheaper the makers have to do this. </s>
<s> If you feel it's worth the costs of a clean OS install then it can be done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Try this: Select &quot;Run&quot; in the &quot;Start&quot; menu, and type msconfig in the space, and hit Enter. </s>
<s> Select the &quot;Startup&quot; tab, and you will see a list of all the little programs that start automatically every time you boot your computer. </s>
<s> By unchecking the ones you don't want or need to be running, you will free up your computer's resources. </s>
<s> You might want to put the mouse cursor on the last little boundary line at the top of the list and move it to the right, so you can see more of the location list for the programs; that way, you can usually tell what they are. </s>
<s> Don't forget to click on the &quot;Apply&quot; button at the bottome before clicking on &quot;OK&quot;. </s>
<s> See if this helps. </s>
<s> You have stated that AFTER 3 or 4 years of use, your computer is getting sluggish. </s>
<s> I can only take that to mean that it wasn't as slow in the beginning when it was new. </s>
<s> Therefore, the programs that Dell installed are apparently not the problem, since they were there from the beginning. </s>
<s> All computers get slow after awhile if they aren't maintained on a regular basis. </s>
<s> Every program that you install, even if only for a short period, every picture you view from your email, every web page that you visit, etc., all leave small traces of themselves on your computer. </s>
<s> If you don't clean these out on a regular basis, they begin to slow your computer down. </s>
<s> Essentially, you need to understand that every time you click on an icon, that sends a series of commands to your computer. </s>
<s> The computer then begins a search for the criteria your click demanded, whether that be to open a program, view a web page or whatever. </s>
<s> When the computer searches, the more &quot;junk&quot; you have on your computer, the longer the search is going to take because of all the sifting out the system has to do. </s>
<s> That's why defragging is so important. </s>
<s> When you defrag your system, you bring all the pertinent files together in one area, instead of the computer having to search all over for bits and pieces of the files, they are all easily accessible from one point. </s>
<s> Thus, the search is speeded up. </s>
<s> Same with junk files. </s>
<s> The computer searches your whole system to find all the files linked to your original &quot;click&quot;. </s>
<s> If you have tons of junk files, that's just that much more searching that the system has to do before it completes it's task. </s>
<s> I think with a &quot;clean install&quot; with the recovery disc, the main point is that you now know what things you don't want on the computer. </s>
<s> Therefore, you can do the install, and then immediately remove the programs that you do not want to keep. </s>
<s> That way, you can start fresh, AND without all the bundled software that the makers think you should try. </s>
<s> The uninstalls are easily done through the control panel with Add/Remove Programs. </s>
<s> Once you have removed all the programs you want off of there, then do a defragmentation of the drive, so as to pull all the files together where they belong. </s>
<s> This should make a big difference in how the computer runs. </s>
<s> Also, be sure to check your startup programs so that no &quot;reminders&quot; or &quot;update&quot; checkers are running when you load Windows. </s>
<s> These are very sneaky, and can be real resource hogs. </s>
<s> If you need to know how, let me know, and I'd be glad to walk you through it. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
<s> Guess what? </s>
<s> I can give some few tips to get your dell run fast again and perhaps save your $'s. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Go to Control panel then add/remove programs. </s>
<s> Look for programs you don't need and remove them. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Explore &quot;My Computer&quot; and right click on C drive, left click properties and disk cleanup. </s>
<s> it will free some unnecessary files. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> After that, left click tools then defrag. </s>
<s> It will arrange all your files and will give priority to your favorite program. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Well, ask me more if you need me. </s>
<s> Enjoy! </s>
<s> many times means you have spyware on your computer. </s>
<s> Have you scanned for spyware lately? </s>
<s> There are some good free programs out there - use at least 2, maybe 3, to make sure you get it all! </s>
<s> And scan regularly. </s>
<s> &quot;I've had Dell's for years and have been generally happy, but after 3 or 4 years it gets verrrrrrry slooooooow. </s>
<s> Knowledeable friends tell me it's because the computer came with so much junk - trial softwares, ads, etc&quot; This statement is illogical. </s>
<s> If the &quot;junk&quot; were a problem, why would it take three to four years for the problemsto araise? </s>
<s> I the &quot;junk&quot; were the problem, then the problems would start on day zero. </s>
<s> I have no idea what your problem is since you posted no useful information about it. </s>
<s> I think the last comment is a bit harsh. </s>
<s> I see no reason why that couldn't be the problem. </s>
<s> I have a dell, and phoned them and asked them to send the OS, which they did. </s>
<s> I did a wipe and reinstalled. </s>
<s> You have no idea how much better it runs now. </s>
<s> I agree that more stuff could have accumulated, but the crap dell puts on there definately slows it down. </s>
<s> I suggest getting the cd's (you'll also need the driver disks) off dell and enlisting the help of a friend to wipe and reinstall. </s>
<s> Its not all that difficult, just time consuming. </s>
<s> this will also get rid of any junk thats built up since then </s>
<s> I understand what you are saying but I do not beleive your problem can be the &quot;extras&quot;. </s>
<s> I had a hard drive crash (after only 2 1/2 years)and needed to start over. </s>
<s> One thing I found was a faster computer because all of &quot;My Junk&quot; was gone. </s>
<s> Didn't have all the left overs from uninstalled programs, non used programs and the &quot;I am afraid to delete this for fear I will need later&quot; stuff. </s>
<s> With the install of the operating system again, witht the &quot;extras&quot;, I was still faster than when it crashed. </s>
<s> I actually bless the crash for cleaning my computer. </s>
<s> I have to agree with msgale. </s>
<s> The extra crap installed by Dell is going to affect the speed of the PC from day 1, and not wait until 3-4 years later. </s>
<s> All of the other junk that is installed along the way (commercial software, shareware, freeware, hardware drivers, etc.) </s>
<s> will accumulate to affect the speed over time. </s>
<s> For that reason, reinstalling the OS, even from the original disks containing all of the original crap, will return the speed that you experienced when you first purchased the PC. </s>
<s> The problem is that new PC's DO contain too much &quot;junk&quot; programs from manufacturer's, which clearly indicates they are gaining advertising advantage from software vendors -- even for the &quot;free&quot; 60 day software offers! </s>
<s> My new HP Desktop Pavilion a1477c, AMD 64 X2 4400, had more than 100 pieces of &quot;trash&quot; that I cleaned off in different ways. </s>
<s> I used &quot;msconfig,&quot; which drove me nuts re-starting and re-warning against starting msconfig in this way (with programs UN'checked). </s>
<s> I used Control Panel &quot;Install/Remove&quot; software. </s>
<s> And ended up with whacked-out registry problems, and invalid startup programs I couldn't even find installed on the computer. </s>
<s> I installed Registry Mechanic, which helped. </s>
<s> I installed System Mechanic Pro 7, which helped, but came to the &quot;remove unused, unneeded uninstallers,&quot; which when I did, caused even more havoc because some of the uninstallers were actually needed. </s>
<s> At best, it is a major deal to have to play with this UNWANTED software. </s>
<s> THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED BY COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS. </s>
<s> At the very least, no software non-essential to basic computer tasks (such as the op/sys) should be directly installed, but should offer the user the OPTION to install such programs. </s>
<s> If I buy a home computer for my home office, I do not want 100 games and two game consoles on my computer. </s>
<s> At the very least, I should be given the option to &quot;install&quot; or &quot;not install.&quot; I usually buy 4-8 new computers per year, and end up giving them to family or friends.....but am seriously thinking of switching to building my own because of this problem. </s>
<s> Then, I lost my price advantage because mass produced computers sell for less than I can the price of me building one. </s>
<s> Either way (crap installed or not installed and built by me) I lose!!! </s>
<s> Thanks, computer manufacturers. </s>
<s> I think I wrote how. </s>
<s> The problem is that costs will rise to what they used to be years ago. </s>
<s> Do you remember what IBM and others charged for this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> $150 more for a PC w/o junk? </s>
<s> Michael Dell once said he would consider leaving junk out if he could sell a PC for $150 more. </s>
<s> But he can't control what HP and others will do. </s>
<s> So, just growl and bear it...or you could spend the $150 on another copy of Windows and install over the OEM's image. </s>
<s> Oh, did I mention that business version desktops and laptops come with fewer junk? </s>
<s> Sometimes they are even competitively priced compared to consumer versions. </s>
<s> There are always excuses for everything. </s>
<s> Endless excuses. </s>
<s> Why should I pay more to have the junk removed or never installed? </s>
<s> Dell, HP, Gateway, etc. </s>
<s> has the problem -- knowing their customers are dissatisfied, but doing it anyway! </s>
<s> No wonder Mr Dell just fired his company leader and took leadership back. </s>
<s> And the phone help from India is another solution to real bottom line -- even though very few customers like what was done in the matter of tech support. </s>
<s> All I'm asking for is the right to have the choice to install or not install this junk software. </s>
<s> I believe I deserve such a right if I am paying for the machine. </s>
<s> If these companies do not believe I have such a right, let them wait until I purchase one of their machines again. </s>
<s> (Which will not happen!) </s>
<s> The junk pays down the costs of the product. </s>
<s> The increased costs are not to remove the extras. </s>
<s> I fear you may not be grasping how this works. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All the extra software Garbage on Our Computers It is NOT ONLY Unacceptable It Is NOT AMERICAN. </s>
<s> Just think Who Would be the Players involved in this BLOOD$$$$$THIRSTY SCAM.?? </s>
<s> Lenber </s>
<s> The solutions are simple, laid out in this discussion. </s>
<s> If you missed it, members can repeat it if you wish. </s>
<s> Or are you just letting off some steam? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Explain how this is &quot;not American&quot; please. </s>
<s> I think it is a rather simple capitalistic strategy that the PC makers are using and isn't America land of capitalism or is there something else that America is nowadays? </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> You Got It! </s>
<s> Lenber </s>
<s> If this is &quot;good&quot; capitalism (to add junk to a product because vendors of junk will pay to have it included in other products -- at the expense of buyers) then we have a capitalism problem (which, indeed, we do!). </s>
<s> Our jobs are shipped overseas to cut costs and raise profits. </s>
<s> Our parts are purchased from the cheapest vendor, not the most reliable with the best product. </s>
<s> Every capitalism decision is based on the almighty DOLLAR? </s>
<s> Deals are made with larger companies for mass outlet sales (i.e., Wal-Mart, Circuit City, Best Buy, etc.) </s>
<s> who will gladly sell the junk with the discounted prices they can obtain, because it allows them to mass-market their product. </s>
<s> I DO GET IT. </s>
<s> I have been getting it for a long time, but have not liked it at all. </s>
<s> And I believe it is time to call for a halt to the nefarious practices -- even if they lower PC prices for consumers. </s>
<s> Build a good product, a clean, fast product, and sell it that way. </s>
<s> Why build a fast product (X2 and Dual Core CPU's,and faster memory and hard drives with faster graphics cards), then slow them ALL down with loads of crapola that most people will NEVER use??? </s>
<s> Makes no sense to me. </s>
<s> And, yes, it is a good suggestion to buy the small business and business models that come without the junk. </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
<s> Now, manufacturers, do something about the home and home office models, that don't need the junk either. </s>
<s> American capitalism has always found a way to do what is right for the consumers. </s>
<s> Why can't a way be found now? </s>
<s> I am asking for the OPTION to install or not install. </s>
<s> I am not venting.....well, maybe a little.....or a lot! </s>
<s> Because I am genuinely ticked off because of the inconsiderate capitalistic decisions made AGAINST the very people who buy the products. </s>
<s> :=)) </s>
<s> Maybe you can help to start a company that will attempt to sell inexpensive computers with absolutely no junkware. </s>
<s> If there is a strong market for such things at a price that will be profitable, then it will be successful and you will be very wealthy! </s>
<s> Heck, I'll even buy some stock after you IPO. </s>
<s> I wonder if R&D, purchasing, and marketing departments ever get together in these big companies to consider such things...nah, they wouldn't do that. </s>
<s> Maybe they would even test-market such things...nah, they wouldn't do that. </s>
<s> Market research and consumer polls? </s>
<s> ...nah, they wouldn't do that. </s>
<s> Price points? </s>
<s> ...nah. </s>

<s> I bought a kick ass top of the line computer from Dell last year, and it was loaded with a bunch of crap that was conflicting with Photoshop, and some of the other imaging software that I use. </s>
<s> I called Dell, and for 20 bucks they sent me 2 restore discs. </s>
<s> One has XP on it, and the other has device drivers on it. </s>
<s> I was able to just have a clean install of Windows and put only that software that I need to use. </s>
<s> I find it interesting that nobody seems to have addressed several items that come to my mind: 1) Does the user do a regular defrag on his/her computer? </s>
<s> 2) Has the user installed a lot of other software over the years and maybe uninstalled some of those programs? </s>
<s> 3) Does the user have a registry cleaning program that is used on a regular basis? </s>
<s> These are just some of the items that a user (especially a novice) often overlooks that will eventually cause a PC to slow down. </s>
<s> As with anything you own, you have to maintain it properly to keep it in good working order. </s>
<s> Of course, there's also the problem aging, which gets to humans and machines both eventually. </s>
<s> As I said, I use Registry Mechanic, and System Mechanic Pro Vers 7, on a regular basis. </s>
<s> Both are top notch programs to help straighten out a 'puter. </s>
<s> Sys Pro has a new feature that allows me to set the repair of several items to auto-repair, and it auto-repairs when the program starts. </s>
<s> I have installed some programs: Roboform, MS Office, PC Study Bible, Spyware Doctor. </s>
<s> Files are organized in My Docs, and machine is regularly cleaned. </s>
<s> The machine works in top shape. </s>
<s> I just want the option to install or not install all the junk that comes on computers nowdays. </s>
<s> I build'em, repair'em, sell'em, trade'em. </s>
<s> I maintain'em by cleaning'em. </s>
<s> I network'em, I upgrade'em. </s>
<s> And I love it, but I hate junk on a 'puter! </s>
<s> Every buyer should be able to have a 'puter designed and setup after his/her own desires, w/o having to fight the crap. </s>
<s> Mike Dell is greedy, consumers know it and don't like it --- ergo his problems today with his company. </s>
<s> Junk collectors want junk but 'puter lovers don't! </s>
<s> you are really just venting without a solution! </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Every buyer should be able to have a 'puter designed and setup after his/her own desires, w/o having to fight the crap Already exists! </s>
<s> Thousands of computer shops will do that for you or you could &quot;roll your own&quot;, including laptops. </s>
<s> Some are even able to deliver customized business Dells or HPs anyway you like it. </s>
<s> Just don't expect the OEMs to sell consumer PCs w/o crap to you, either directly or thru their channel partners, at a lower price than those alternatives. </s>
<s> With your smarts, I take it you have already priced the alternatives. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Mike Dell is greedy, consumers know it and don't like it --- ergo his problems today with his company. </s>
<s> No, that's not why he's having problems. </s>
<s> If that was it, HP would be suffering likewise but it's not. </s>
<s> Dell may be the poster child in this regard for what's frustrating about capitalism, but consumers are a small fraction of his business and our whining have little effect. </s>
<s> It's the loss of business customers (who already don't get crapware) that are his headaches. </s>
<s> It's the loss of competitive supply chain advantages that are his headaches. </s>
<s> It's the bloating cost infrastructure of his company that are his headaches. </s>
<s> It's the lack of good ideas for new higher margin products that are his headaches. </s>
<s> It's the... you get the gist. </s>
<s> Speaking of capitalism, how much less capitalistic are you by wanting a lower price puter so that the cash can go towards the next SUV or big screen TV or stainless steel refrigerator with LCD panel? </s>
<s> Well, Samkh, you have set me free from my worries by having all the right answers! </s>
<s> No sweat, no worries.....I got it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the brilliant analysis. </s>

<s> I've solved periodic problems by using vendor chat sessions and help. </s>
<s> But, thanks for all your help but most of you are not talking to the 75% of consumers who buy computers and have no courage to do what many of you suggest as &quot;easy&quot;. </s>
<s> I tried the msconfig route as suggested, and after the 4th time of starting my computer followed by &quot;you are choosing to start without the normal startup configuration...&quot; followed by a restart which takes another 5 minutes, I conclude I'm better off with the 10 minutes of startup I had originally with the junk starting up. </s>
<s> As far as add/remove programs; everytime I try that I get a warning message &quot;are you sure you want to do this - other programs may no run if you proceed...&quot;. </s>
<s> And I give up. </s>
<s> I agree with a number of reply posters who ask &quot;why are we getting this junk in the first place?&quot; Why do the restore disks put this same junk back onto my computer? </s>
<s> Why does Michael Dell, and his cohorts at Gateway think that they can succeed long term by shafting the 75% of computer users who are paying for his equipment (and his yacht, and his basketball team, and his mansions)? </s>
<s> Many of you talk about buying from a local assembler, but I'm afraid of that too. </s>
<s> Who knows who this guy is? </s>
<s> I conclude I must buy from Voodoo or Falcon, even though I'm not a gamer, because they PROMISE nothing on the computer but the OS and Office. </s>
<s> I asked Falcon if I could have Norton IS 2007 and they said, &quot;if you want it, we'll buy it retail and install it for you and send the original disks for your use&quot;. </s>
<s> Now THAT'S commitment to the buyer, not to some software vendor that they are in bed with. </s>
<s> Yeah, I'm going to spend about $1K more, but you know what - 4 years later I'll be happy that I did. </s>
<s> By the way, for all of you who suggested solutions, I regularly run RegScrub, defrag, diskcleanup, and Norton scans. </s>
<s> No big noticeable improvement. </s>
<s> Chaslosh, I was not a techie and still could not qualify, but I have taken as many 'puter mags each month as I could and read them word for word each month for years. </s>
<s> I have learned a few things. </s>
<s> The warnings you speak of are built-in Microsoft warnings that amount mainly to B-S! </s>
<s> But your last article is right on. </s>
<s> Man, these companies think they can get me to spend my hard earned $$$ for their junk so they can play me with the other biggies they are in bed with! </s>
<s> No more. </s>
<s> When Norton came on with the 3 installations for Norton Systemworks and then its dead and will not run again, I dropped them and will never, never use them again. </s>
<s> For less money I got eSet NOD32 AV that is updated constantly, ahead of the trash curves, and a 2 year 2 user license. </s>
<s> I am saying &quot;bye-bye&quot; to the companies who are playing these games -- and Microsoft is my next target for the Vista mess and the &quot;Genuine Advantage&quot; tools they are forcing on us. </s>
<s> If you are not a techie, start taking MaximumPC and PC World mags. </s>
<s> It is amazing what you can learn from their clear and concise writing of all kinds of problems and new product comparisons. </s>
<s> Again, thanks for starting the thread and for your concise summary of your intent. </s>
<s> I agree wholeheartedly. </s>
<s> Keep it up. </s>
<s> I too have been with Norton for a few years now. </s>
<s> This month when my subscription ran out if was notified by e-mail and given the opportunity to re-subscribe for $39 or upgrage to the new Norton Internet Security package for $59. </s>
<s> I upgraded and paid $5 more for the disk to be sent to me versus the download; from my past horrible results with the Norton download. </s>
<s> Guess what - 2 things: first when I got the disk and ran thru the install, I had major problems and LiveUpdate would not run - spent 2 full days online with their techies to get it working and now only sporadically. </s>
<s> Second, and you'll love this: I was charged for both the re-subscription AND the upgrade for a total of $103 and there's nobody I can talk to. </s>
<s> My next computer will have a different security program, you can bet on it - probably ZoneAlarm that Falcon recommends. </s>
<s> Falcon strongly does not recommend Norton and will only provide it with customer requests. </s>
