Let's look to the past where people pay 4 or more times or &quot;premium&quot; prices to future proof a machine. What happens is the future arrives and the machine is still that same price as your common machine and the owner still has a dated machine but paid dearly for the now old iron. Why not get a nice quad core desktop with the Windows 7 upgrade for about 1K and use that till the future arrives? Bob
