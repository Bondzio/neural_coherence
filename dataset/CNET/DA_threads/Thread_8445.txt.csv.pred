1.1.1	I have a Dell XPS with a HD that is getting full so I have added a second SATA HD.	St
1.1.2	I have turned the second HD &quot;on&quot; in the BIOS, and XP &quot;sees&quot; the HD in the device manager, but it does not list it as an available drive in &quot;My Computer.&quot; I think that I need to format the drive.	St
1.1.3	Is that correct?	St
1.1.4	If so, any suggestions on how to do that?	Ques
1.2.1	Go into XP's Disk Management and partition and format (and possibly activate) the drive.	St
1.2.2	It's simple once you know it.	St
1.2.3	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309000 is helpful.	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
