<s> I have an external ESata rail in my HP8100CTO. </s>
<s> It requires that I boot with the external Esata drive powered up and connected. </s>
<s> If I wait until Windows has booted, it will not be detected. </s>
<s> Would like to find a reliable ESata hot swap program that works all the time. </s>
<s> Regardless of disconnecting the ESata cable, the external drive case supporting this 2.5&quot; drive must have power from an adapter. </s>
<s> The ESata cable supplies data, not power. </s>
