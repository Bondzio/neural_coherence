Hi, I have just bought a new Asus A8N-SLI motherboard.
I plan to buy a SATA hard drive to install along with it in the case (It will be the only hard drive in the PC).
Do I have to have the drive in a RAID?
Or can I just have it as the primary drive?
(I realize there is no secondary drive with a SATA cable).
Also, will I be prompted by Windows XP install to install the drivers for the SATA drive (F6?)?
Or will Windows XP automatically &quot;see&quot; the drive and start installing to the drive?
Thanks for any help you can provide.
