1.1.1	Hey , alright so i 've been having this probelm for awhile but now its really not working .	St
1.1.2	The first time it happen was when i restarted my computer one time , it just shutdown and did n't turn back on , then it would n't turn on .	St
1.1.3	What the computer does is the power light turns on , i can hear my fan getting a lot of air .	St
1.1.4	The probelm is , my computer has a HUGE fan so it doens't always run at full speed .	St
1.1.5	Just when it starts up for about 2-3 seconds , then if it gets hot .	St
1.1.6	When i turn on my computer and i get the probelm my van just keeps sucking in air .	St
1.1.7	Its like my computer is working fine and it turns on , but its only working right for abut 1 second .	St
1.1.8	After that second it like freezes or something it just sits there .	St
1.1.9	My lights turn on , my DVD rom trys reading my cd 's , but my montior just stays black .	St
1.1.10	The computer some times after awhile turns on normal , but only after i turn it on and off many times , each time it always a differnt # of times , and this time it wont just turn on .	St
1.1.11	If any one has any ideas please thanks -Mythraz	Polite
1.2.1	1. you may go for check connecting a different monitor .	St
1.2.2	if it works then after start deleat all driver files of earlier monitor .	St
1.2.3	then reconnect earlier monitor and put correct driver and set correct setting of monitor ( i.e .	St
1.2.4	24 or 32 bit and 800X600 or very apropriate which monitor can sustain/see the monitor manual ) .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	If 1 above does not work then please post the number of addon cards present in your PC and also video detail ( i.e .	Sug
1.2.7	onboard or AGP or PCI ) .	St
1.2.8	Will try then after .	Sug
1.3.1	most monitors do not require a driver , your problem might be the monitor itself or a connection for the monitor but not a driver .	St
1.4.1	In most cases as yours , replacing the psu with a good one of equal wattage or *better* is the 1st step in a repair process .	St
1.4.2	However , it maybe possible the mtrbd .	St
1.4.3	or another compoent has failed .	St
1.4.4	The fans , etc .	St
1.4.5	turning on only suggests that at 12V is working , there are other voltages and likely one rail ( V-outputs ) has failed or been stripped of the amps it needs to turn things on .	St
1.4.6	The clue is repeated attempts may get the system going .	St
1.4.7	The mtrbd .	St
1.4.8	may have a failed capacitor ( cap ) that blown or leaked , etc.. A user can reduce the power demand by reducing the system , thus a possible clue if it boots-up .	St
1.4.9	That 's no cure it just points int he right direct , replace psu .	St
1.4.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
