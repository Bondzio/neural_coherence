i am the same.
i use external hard drives a lot, images, video etc etc think along the lines &quot; if it can happen, then it will happen&quot;.
assume that it will fail.
as drives get bigger and the cost per gb reduces, its worth getting a new one now and again and copying everything to the new one.
this can take quite a while, and there are different ways of doing it (drive imaging etc) but do it, you'll sleep better.
just think about how you would feel if you lost it all.
i use external drives purely for archiving and storage, they are not left running and attached to a pc for long periods of time.
i transfer about every 2 years, or whenever a really good deal on a bigger drive comes along.
one other thing, remember to securely wipe the old drive if you are disposing of it !
