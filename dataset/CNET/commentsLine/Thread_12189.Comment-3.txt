hi bob (when the machine locked up the first two times, the d drive was not in use.
i was trying to open a cd when it did lock the third time.
now it is working.
i did not do anything much; just tried to scan the registry for errors -- none.
then i thought to use the soundcard to play the cd -- creative live!
has a playcenter which can find music sources.
the cd/rw drive played.
then i re-installed wmplayer 9 (which uses very little resources on this machine)and it started to find the songs too.
-- i can not explain the inaccessibility -- it was not just wmp because i could not open the drive through my computer either.
you still believe that the drive is dying?
i don't play cds much on it, nor use it as a rom, but i do burn occasionally, with excellent results.
i realise it's now 5 years old, but it has not done that many miles.
cheers faldown
