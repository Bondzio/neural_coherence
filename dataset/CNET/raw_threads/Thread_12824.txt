When I try to delete it a notice comes which says The file desktop.ini is a system file. If you remove it, your computer or one of your programs may no longer work correctly. Are you sure you want to move it to the Recycle Bin? Please what I can do to be able not to see this file which comes as a pair on desktop?

Try an online virus scanner first then work your way through the rest of the suggested answers.

You can drag-drop them into windows&gt;desktop folder and see if there's one already there that is the same size. If you put a new folder on desktop called &quot;extra or ini&quot; and drop them in, does a reboot recreate them?
