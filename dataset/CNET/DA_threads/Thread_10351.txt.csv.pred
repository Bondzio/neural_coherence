1.1.1	Hello - I have a Epson R800 photo printer which I bought about a year ago .	St
1.1.2	I am having many problems getting the right coloring on my photos .	St
1.1.3	I have photos that I have taken with my Nikon D70 that look BEAUTIFUL when I look at them on my screen .	St
1.1.4	However , when I go to print them , they look awful - especially if the picture is in low light .	St
1.1.5	All of my B & W photos have a bluish tint to them and the reds and lighter tones on people 's skin are WAY too bright - these are just a couple of the problems I am having .	St
1.1.6	I have played around endlessly with the settings on the printer to change the coloring to no avail .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.8	This has been said to be an excellent printer , so I realize that I may be doing something wrong .	St
1.1.9	One person has said that I always need to use actual Epson ink cartridges and not some other brand .	St
1.1.10	Could this be the issue ?	Ques
1.1.11	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.12	Thanks , Matt	St
1.2.1	no savings down the road with off-brand ink .	St
1.2.2	Did you ever get good pictures ( with the Epson ink ) ?	Ques
1.3.1	I did not have the original Epson ink when I got the printer , so I am not sure how it performed .	St
1.3.2	Maybe I should just purchase some and see what happens ?	Ques
1.4.1	I have been very happy with the color prints produced on the R800 , until recently .	St
1.4.2	I 'm getting a blue/green tint to all black and white prints , regardless of whether or not I & quot ; remove color & quot ; , take saturation to & quot ; 0 & quot ; , or do both .	St
1.4.3	I 've always used the Epson ink .	St
1.4.4	At this point , I 've exhausted the traditional options to correct the probelm ( ran all the utility clean-up prodcedures ) .	St
1.4.5	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.5.1	You should do test prints and several cleaning cycles to assure that the printer is up to task .	Sug
1.5.2	As all Epson printers are picky of the quality ink they use , stick with Epson ink until good quality outputs are achieved , thus if you change to different vendort , you can blame the ink .	St
1.5.3	You need to start from scratch .	St
1.5.4	Here 's a link that gives a review on Epson R800 : http : //www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/printers/epson-r800.shtml It appears that a new different ink was used this model notknown before .	St
1.5.5	In that alone , stick with Epson ink .	St
1.5.6	To better clean the printer , directly swipe the printhead with a damp clean cloth to remove all crud/gunk build-up , then do a cleaning cycle .	St
1.5.7	Hope this helps .	St
