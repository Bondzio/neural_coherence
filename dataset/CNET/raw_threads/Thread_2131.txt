I thinking of buying a external HD and I was wondering if I should wait until USB 3.0 comes out in 2010, or the next version of Firewire (S3200). I was looking for a (or at least) 1 TB external HD with USB 2.0, Firewire 400 and 800. The Seagate Freeagent Mac seems perfect, and is priced over $200. Considering both my computers have firewire 800 capabilities... But with the next gen hardware coming out, what would you do? Do you think USB 3 HDs will be available instantly after the release and would HD pricing go up?

Either works fine. Yes some found it to work with their system but given the number of times I've seen it fail I offer the short version. Bob

The harddrives will be the same; only the electronic will be changed. If you wanted to be the first with the latest..there will be more to pay (new mobo or new controller), hehe.
