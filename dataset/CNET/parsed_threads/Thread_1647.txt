<s> Hi I own a Belkin Model# F5D5231-4 connected to two computers, one is a Windows Me The Other Is Windows XP Sharing an internet connection through a Motorolla Voice over IP Cable Modem Model# SBV4200. </s>
<s> The connection is great, however I need to open ports 6881-6889 on the Windows Me computer (it's Ok if ports are open for Windows XP). </s>
<s> I Know This much: I go into the router's setup website, log in and under Firewall tab click on Virtual Servers... Everything there after I dont know, Ex: What do I put in the fields: Description (? </s>
<s> ), Inbound Ports (????-????) </s>
<s> ,Type (TCP/UDP), Private IP Address (xxx.xxx.x.?? </s>
<s> ), Private Ports (????-????) </s>

<s> The instruction are confusing. </s>
<s> I need to know especifically what do I put on each field mentioned on the 1st message above wherever '?' </s>
<s> appears... PortForward would only give me the following: -Private IP (I think I know what it is, but not sure) -Private Port (????) </s>
<s> not (????-????) </s>
<s> -Type (TCP) -Public Port (####) - (I don't have this field) *Notice &quot;Inbound Port&quot; field is not mentioned Also, I've tried to the best of my abilities to match the instructions to open the ports and have been unsuccesful per Shields Up On the WinME Computer I have Zone Alarm Pro which I have already set to Allow Incoming TCP Ports 6881-6889 On WinXP computer I have added ports for incomming traffic... </s>
<s> I have Kaspersky Antihacker Firewall on WinXP only, with the firewall set on Medium w/Stealth i want to keep it that way, after all, I need the ports open on WinME Computer </s>
<s> ports for? </s>
<s> A Private IP address is simply the address of the PC you are forwarding to. </s>
<s> The Port range are those ports being opened. </s>
<s> Use TCP or UDP or both if specified by the program. </s>
<s> You probably are not using a Public port unless specified by the program, so leave it blank. </s>
<s> BitTorrent </s>
<s> Thats the thing I Dont have a &quot;Public IP Address&quot; field, nor I am worried about that. </s>
<s> I need to know what to input on the fields mentioned below wherever &quot;?&quot; appears. </s>
<s> Description: ???????????? </s>
<s> Inbound Port: ????-???? </s>
<s> Type: (TCP/UDP) ??? </s>
<s> Private IP Address: xxx.xxx.x.?? </s>
<s> Private Port: ????-???? </s>
<s> These are the only fields requested along with the &quot;Enable&quot; field which is checked. </s>
<s> Look at the link I supplied and click on the Bit Torrent entry. </s>
<s> It's all there. </s>
<s> Ok I've been to the PortForward Site selected the router and the program the url is: http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Belkin/F5D5231-4/BitTorrent.htm However, if you read further down, where you get to the screen capture for the Virtual Servers, you'll notice the fields that are required: -Description -Inbound Ports -Type -Private IP Address -Private Port Keep reading because now the website gives you the following - Private IP - Private Port (????) </s>
<s> not (????-????) </s>
<s> as shown on the screen capture - Public Port (????) </s>
<s> which not listed above As Of Now I am downloading a file 4.3GB and the torrent estimated download is 1 day 11 hrs @ 32KB/s (sometimes up to 50 KBps) with a max upload speed 7.8MB/s (if I lower it 29KB/s, download speed will decrease to 10KB/s) This was after I Input the following on the required fields: Desc: BitTorrent Inbound Port: 6881-6889 Type: TCP Private IP: (~ip provided) Private Port: 6881-6889 But I still have doubts about the ports being open. </s>
<s> Shields up reports the ports as being &quot;Stealth&quot; Is there anyway to make my downloads faster </s>
<s> traffic would not pass. </s>
<s> Be patient, that movie/music file will eventually get to you </s>
<s> I was just concerned b/c Shields Up reports the ports as being &quot;Stealth&quot; but I will continue to be patient, I mean most of the time the download speed 25KB/s which is not that bad, Thanks Again!! </s>
