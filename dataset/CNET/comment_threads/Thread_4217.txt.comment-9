I'd think you best be prepared to boot from floppy OR CD OR DVD OR USB Flash OR whatever next comes along.
Part of school means learning things that are out of date.
For example, your A+ certification requires you know what wire is DSR on COM1, and to know DOS error codes.
Don't be misled that you'll actually use that knowledge.
Nor a floppy drive, in most cases.
The bigger picture is getting a good understanding of how things work, generally, so that you'll be able to adapt to the rapidly-changing IT world.
