<s> Hi, I want a 250GB external harddrive that's pre assembled. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend the time with putting together the enclosure. </s>
<s> It needs to have at least 1 firewire port. </s>
<s> I prefer it to be a quiet model and transfer at a quicker rate than most. </s>
<s> Also, I would love a 16MB cache but it's not necessary. </s>
<s> I've been looking at the Western My Book. </s>
<s> Could anyone that owns it tell me about it? </s>
<s> Don't connect that to a PC. </s>
<s> I'm still helping people recover data from firewire connected drives on PCs. </s>
<s> Yes, that unit does work. </s>
<s> No reports of what happens when you run it full tilt. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
