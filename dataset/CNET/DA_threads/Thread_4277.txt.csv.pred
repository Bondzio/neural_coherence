1.1.1	I 'm running a dual-boot setup with Windows XP and Windows Vista Home Premium and I 've gone and put all my documents , music , pictures , and other garbage onto my external hard drive to put it in an easily accessible common location .	St
1.1.2	Now under Windows XP , it works perfectly just as it should .	St
1.1.3	In and out of standby , running for days on end , it just works perfectly .	St
1.1.4	However , under Windows Vista , it 'll work just fine to start , but it seems that at a certain point , whether it 's going into and out of standby or whatever , it 'll start up for a brief moment and then spin down again , so when I need something from the drive , it needs to spin up again .	St
1.1.5	I 've even set turn off hard disks in the power options to & quot ; never & quot ; and it still idles itself .	St
1.1.6	Is there anything I have n't though of to solve this problem ?	Ques
1.1.7	Relevant specs ?	Ques
1.1.8	Pentium 4 521 2 GB DDR2-667 2x 80 GB 7200 RPM RAID 0 X550 Graphics Intel D 945G chipset	St
1.2.1	MS never took to firewire for storage .	St
1.2.2	Yes , go ahead and tell me it seems to work but the brutal advice I can offer here is ... Windows ?	Sug
1.2.3	Use USB .	St
1.2.4	Apple ?	Ques
1.2.5	Firewire .	St
1.2.6	Linux ?	Ques
1.2.7	Your choice .	St
1.2.8	If you truly believe it should work , be sure to talk to the machine makers and of course those is Redmond .	St
1.2.9	My advice is to not use firewire on windows for hard disks because too many bring me them to try and recover their files .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
1.3.1	VISTA IS BROKEN ! ! ! ! !	St
1.3.2	Sorry to sound so callused , but Vista is broken .	St
1.3.3	Why anyone would use it is beyond me .	Ques
1.3.4	No , I do n't have an answer except to remove Vista .	St
1.3.5	It has failed on more computers from day one than any other operating system .	St
1.3.6	Well , maybe not more than Me .	St
1.3.7	Can you honestly tell us why you are running Vista ?	Ques
1.3.8	Honestly ?	Ques
1.3.9	XP is not broken , it 's tried and true , and everything works with it .	St
1.3.10	It sounds like you 're pretty computer literate .	St
1.3.11	And if so , why did you install Vista , knowing , as you surely do , that Vista has been pure Hell .	St
1.3.12	Just wondering .	St
1.4.1	Because it 's been really pretty usable for me .	St
1.4.2	I 've had the few programs and a couple peripherals that do n't like it all that much but other than that , with the stuff I use the absolute most , it actually works better , and I 'm saying this honestly .	St
1.4.3	My startups are actually faster with Vista than they are with XP , too .	St
1.4.4	I must have just lucked out .	St
1.4.5	Other than this , of course .	St
1.4.6	( If you want to mention the betas of Vista though , then you 're right .	St
1.4.7	They were definitely not all together ! )	St
1.5.1	I was able to get a hotfix straight from the source ( Microsoft ) but so far , that has n't exactly worked either .	St
1.5.2	For now , I 'm going to just use the drive on USB , but if anybody can get this one figured out , let me know !	St
1.6.1	XP 's got its issues , too .	St
1.6.2	Hibernate has a tendency not to work properly with over 1 GB of RAM for some reason .	St
1.6.3	This should be fixed in SP3 , if it EVER gets here !	St
1.7.1	Remember that firewire was the connection of choice of a competitor .	St
1.7.2	This alone is part of the reason why it never got a big shakedown .	St
1.7.3	Given the broken filesystems I 've seen I can only share that & quot ; it 's not working & quot ; and hope people can move to what does work .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Of course , then there 's Sony , who took the technology and rebranded it as their own , calling it i.Link .	St
1.8.2	Sony sold their own computers and they were all Windows based .	St
1.8.3	For now , I 'm just using the drive with USB until a real hotfix can be delivered .	St
1.8.4	I really prefer the Firewire because it can be daisy chained with my scanner , and because when I put my system to sleep , it takes the drive with it .	St
1.8.5	Less heat generated and less power used , especially during the summer months when you have no air conditioning .	St
1.9.1	When my desktop hibernates the USB drives spin down .	St
1.9.2	I 'm using this case : http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=XS-3500SU-BK & cat=HDD Bob	St
1.10.1	http : //www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/_eol/usb/drives/ACS-200/ That 's what I 'm using .	St
1.10.2	So far , I 've really liked it .	St
1.10.3	I 'd probably get an eSATA enclosure , but I really do n't feel like adding an external controller for it .	St
