hello all, i was just wondering which filesystem is best for dvd burning.
cdburnerxp pro offers 3 files systems, namely joliet, iso-level 1 and iso-level 2. i found from wikipedia that joliet is microsoft endorsed file system but if i am making dvd back-ups which file system i should go for?
that will run on pc, mac as well as linux.
many thanks
