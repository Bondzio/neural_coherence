<s> This is the second Microphone I've bought for my Windows XP computer and I plug the thing into the pink jack and turn it on and the Sound Effect Manager detects the microphone but when I try to use Speech Recognition like Windows XP says to do in help, there is no option for the microphone to speak and in Sound Recorder I get NO SOUND line recording!!! </s>
<s> Please help, how do I get the Microphone to work? </s>
<s> I want to be able to record sound with videos on my Logitech QuickCam Webcam! </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> If you double click your speaker in the tray and then go to properties you'll see theres a slider there for the microphone. </s>
<s> Is it muted? </s>
<s> And the way you said to put the sound in the taskbar was the only way to find this out. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> The microphone was muted. </s>
