1.1.1	Hi All !	St
1.1.2	Just upgraded to a new 2.1 setup : Klipsch RF-82s PA-120 sub Marantz SR7005 Marantz IS 301 wireless iPod dock I have converted most of my cds into apple lossless on itunes .	St
1.1.3	Needless to say , these files are massive and I ca n't play them off my iPods .	St
1.1.4	I am considering buying a 1TB media drive ( with HDMI out ) , transfer my lossless files on it and connect to my receiver .	St
1.1.5	The worries I have are a ) what media drives actually play apple lossless and b ) what media drive has the best UI to organize the music into playlists etc .	St
1.1.6	I hope to take my comp out of the equation ( its not near my 2.1 setup ) and just play off the avr and tv .	St
1.1.7	I have considered an Apple TV + external hard drive solution but will still have to use itunes of my comp to use that setup .	St
1.1.8	Alternately , I could use Airport Express with my itunes/external hard drive but this too does not remove the comp from the setup .	St
1.1.9	Also , just wondering whether there would potentially be any loss in quality in streaming music through Airport Express .	St
1.1.10	Does an HDMI out media drive ensure better sound quality ?	Ques
1.1.11	I am already using the Marantz IS 301 dock which is linked to my receiver through analog audio and transmits via bluetooth .	St
1.1.12	Any advice would be hugely appreciated .	Polite
1.1.13	Many Thanks !	St
1.2.1	I 'm going with no .	St
1.2.2	That 's just one link in the quality chain .	St
1.2.3	Your choice on the encoding but given the usual headphones and speakers I ca n't tell the difference from lossless to hi-rate MP3 .	St
1.2.4	Maybe you do n't have to do much other than re-test your encoding method ?	Ques
1.2.5	The only assurance of such quality is when you think it 's quality meets your standard .	St
1.2.6	HDMI by itself is not enough .	St

1.3.1	Thank you Bob .	St
1.3.2	When you say 're test your encoding method ' do you mean consider switching from apple lossless to flac ?	Ques
1.3.3	Still , How would I go about storing these files and playing them from an external source if taking the comp/itunes out ?	Ques
1.4.1	You could try that and see what you think .	Sug
1.4.2	And about your question of storing files : Files are files .	St
1.4.3	You store them on whatever place you wish .	St
1.4.4	There is nothing special about these files .	St
1.4.5	Copy them where you want them .	St
