<s> I'd been wondering if cables marked USB-2 were really faster than USB-1 and worth the extra money. </s>
<s> So I decided to test the speed. </s>
<s> Not scientifically by any fashion, but the results were interesting. </s>
<s> I just used the sweep second hand on my wrist watch. </s>
<s> My machine specs: Home built with Shuttle main board with 6 USB-2 ports, AMD 2400+ XP processor, 512 Meg RAM. </s>
<s> Optical drive: Sony 52/32/52 CD burner. </s>
<s> Drive case: BYTECC USB-2. </s>
<s> Procedure: Copy a large file from the USB drive to a folder on my HD. </s>
<s> I used the supplied USB-2 cable that came with the case and a several year old USB-1 cable from an older USB Zip-100 drive. </s>
<s> File copied: IE6 full, 48 Meg in size from a CD-RW disk that I had burned a while back. </s>
<s> Results: USB-1 cable took 25 seconds. </s>
<s> USB-2 cable took 19 seconds. </s>
<s> So there you are folks. </s>
<s> I suspect some cables may be more equal than others...some of the earlier (or real cheap) USB1 cables might not do quiet as well, but your overall results are quite interesting. </s>
<s> USB1 and USB2 cables are wired exactly the same. </s>
<s> The USB2 cables are shielded better, and thus can be spec'ed for higher signal speed than the older USB1 cables. </s>
<s> However, depending upon the environment (how &quot;RF noisy&quot;) and cable length, a very short run of USB1 cable should be able to handle the higher speed of USB2. </s>
<s> USB1 (actually USB1.1) or otherwise called &quot;USB Full-Speed&quot; interface is supposed to go 12 Mbps (Mega bits per second) and USB2, or otherwise called &quot;USB Hi-Speed&quot;, is supposed to go 480 Mbps. </s>
<s> 12 Mbps is approximately 1.5 MBps (Mega Bytes per second) and 480 Mbps is approximately 60 MBps. </s>
<s> But that does not provide for any protocol overhead, and other loss. </s>
<s> So far, neither interface is yet living up to the hype. </s>
<s> I think, on a good day, USB1 interface is typically getting about half of its promise, around 0.8 MBps, and USB2 is typically getting much less than a third of its promise, at about 8 to 20 MBps. </s>
