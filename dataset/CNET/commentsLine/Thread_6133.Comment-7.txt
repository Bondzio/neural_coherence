you will want to get a hard drive with the longest warranty possible.
i try to aim for 3 years.
though last time i checked most have dropped their warranty support to one year.
and to get a &quot;serial&quot; hdd and cable.
though that won't be hard since &quot;serial&quot; has taken over the market.
you could try to get a hdd with 10,000 rpm, though i'm not sure if such extra speed is necessary.
the 8mb buffer is nice.
two other considerations.
scsi/raid.
both promise faster performance and both add considerable cost to your pc(especially scsi)
