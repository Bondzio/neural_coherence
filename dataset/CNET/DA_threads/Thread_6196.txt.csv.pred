1.1.1	Okay .	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to access my hard drive from another computer since it became unbootable after my computer told me that there was an incompatible program on its drive .	St
1.1.3	I bought a laptop hard drive enclosure from Newegg.com .	St
1.1.4	It 's a Rosewill enclosure , very cheaply made .	St
1.1.5	The manual was filled with grammatical errors and typos .	St
1.1.6	I 'm asuming that there were translation problems .	St
1.1.7	Anyway , it told me that I had to create a new partition in the hard drive and consequently reformat it .	St
1.1.8	Unfortunately , I 'm also trying to retrieve three-years-worth of work from the hard drive , and I would prefer not to erase the data to do that .	St
1.1.9	Is there any way I can get around this ?	Ques
1.1.10	My partner just bought an iMac , but I have a Windows based computer ( Compaq Presario 2100 notebook pc ) .	St
1.1.11	How can I create a partition without erasing the data ?	Ques
1.2.1	do n't see drives correctly or only see 60 or 80 or 100GBs .	St
1.2.2	I bought a 100GB laptop HDD and had to do some searching to find an enclosure that would recognize the entire drive .	St
1.2.3	I ended up getting an Adaptec enclosure ... all their enclosures support drives up to 1000GBs .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	It 's small .	St
1.3.2	Rosewill did n't specify anything ...	St
1.4.1	I boot up a LiveCD of any number of Linux versions .	St
1.4.2	While I prefer Knoppix , there is also PCLinuxOS and DSL that are worth trying to see if they see the files .	St
1.4.3	Since you are in some file/drive recovery mode you have to reveal the details .	St
1.4.4	For instance one person was trying to recover files from a NTFS formatted drive on a Windows 98se machine .	St
1.4.5	Oops .	St
1.4.6	In closing see if a demo of ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY sees the files from http : //www.z-a-recovery.com/ sees it .	St
1.4.7	At that point this becomes an economic decision .	St
1.4.8	Are my files worth this much ?	Ques
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	You could always hook the drive up as a slave inside another machine and just pull the files off that way .	Sug
1.5.2	You could possibly forget the whole external hard drive enclosure .	St
1.5.3	If it is a laptop hard drive you might need an adapter but it should be easy to do .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	If your friend is willing and has a pc have him install the drive in an extra slot of the PC [ for stability reasons ] connect the middle connector to main drive and first connector to your drive .	St
1.7.2	Do not have slave or master selected on your drive .	St
1.7.3	Leave empty.Connect Power : When you start your friends pc the drive should be showing itself .	St
1.7.4	From there you can grab what you want off of it .	St
1.7.5	There are many self help quides on the net to explain this in detail or diagrams if you want .	St
1.7.6	IF you do not see it and have trouble 's there is a program from http : //www.grc.com/intro.htm called Spin Rite by Steve GIbson that recovers Hard drives .	St
1.7.7	Just for your info .	St
1.7.8	May come in handy and is not expensive .	St
1.8.1	If you have a 2.5 notebook drive , you may need an adapter to fit the 3.5 standard drive cable .	St
1.8.2	But you would hook the drive you want the information off of as the slave ( change jumper to slave ) on the second channel of you IDE Cable .	St
1.8.3	Make sure that the primary hard drive on this machine has its jumper set to be master and not Cable Select as sometimes the case .	St
1.8.4	Once the hard drives are connected to the IDE Channel and both have power and jumpered correctly , you should be able to see it once you boot up and then just Drag and drop .	St
1.9.1	... with my partner 's old Dell computer this weekend at his parents ' house .	St
1.9.2	Tell me , though , what is drag and drop ?	Ques
1.9.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.10.1	I tried the above solution , did n't work , but I do n't think I did it correctly .	St
1.10.2	There were three slots ; one was empty and had no ribbon .	St
1.10.3	The second one was connected to the CD Drive and it had a slave port .	St
1.10.4	The third one was connected to the primary hard drive but had no slave port .	St
1.10.5	I connected my laptop hard drive through an adapter to the secondary hook-up of the second ribbon ( did n't work ) , then disconnected the CD drive and connected the end of the ribbon to my laptop hard drive , still did n't work .	St
1.10.6	The screen would blip on and there would be a loud beep from the machine and it would say that the hard drive could n't be detected .	St
1.10.7	I 'm thinking that the ribbon connected to the primary hard drive needed a slave port .	St
1.10.8	Can anyone correct me if I 'm wrong ?	Ques
