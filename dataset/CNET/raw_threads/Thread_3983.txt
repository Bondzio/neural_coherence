Look up SYNCTOY (google.com) and see if you like it. &quot;Anyone have any ideas what's the best way to do this?&quot; None at all. You didn't define what would make one solution better than the other. Bob

One may assume, and im sure the original poster will correct me if im wrong , that when people ask about synching laptops with desktops, what they really mean is they would like to have their laptop look like their desktop- same shortcuts same favorites and most of all their e-mail and documents readily available. Synctoy will do just that over your home network, i personally use it everyday, for email and for documents- pictures music and other heavy files get done mostly before I travel so I will have the current stuff with me. This is the easy way, sure you can go and buy expensive software, sure you can burn discs for backup , those ways are either harder on your pocket or your time when your only talking about backing up one or two pcs.
