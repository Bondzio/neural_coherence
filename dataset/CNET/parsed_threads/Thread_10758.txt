<s> I keep getting a message when closing from Windows that states' Installing updates1 of 1' and then telling me not to turn off as pc will turn itself off. </s>
<s> That takes time. </s>
<s> Coincidental or otherwise printer, HP Deskjet D4260 that was printing normally has stopped working and installing Cd supplied only brings up message 'Print spooler service is not running' I purchased 1 Uniblue Powersuite2009 on 18th June last and I wonder is it a scam, although recommended by you, as it made no difference to the pc's performance. </s>
<s> Any assistance would be much appreciated </s>
<s> What OS are you using, AV/Anti spyware? </s>
<s> As for the printer error, look at Hewlett Packard's site for print spooler error fixes, there should be a patch to download and run to deal with that issue. </s>
<s> As for the other items, need more info. </s>
