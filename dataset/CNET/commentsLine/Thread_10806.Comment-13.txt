okay i will give it a try but i dunt think the problem is with the signal cause i sit around 4 meters awayed from the router and only a 1 meter wide wall seperated me and the router.and i will try the settings and get back to you as soon as possible and you know it can be real tricky sometimes it keep connecting fine around for 4hours + then suddenly it disconnected and hard to connect again : )
