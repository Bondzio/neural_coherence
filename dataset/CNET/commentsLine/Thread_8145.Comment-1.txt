hi,i am looking to be pointed in the right direction for a great bang for the buck motherboard for gamers.
i don't have a ton of money to spend on it, around $200.00 neighborhood.
my main concern is that the board be future ready and reliable.
also, whether i should go pci express or stick with agp.
the card i have in my current pc is a radeon 9800 pro 128mb.
what i'm wondering is should i get an agp board and cannibalize the old computer, thus saving money or bide my time and get the pci express.
so confused, lol.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
