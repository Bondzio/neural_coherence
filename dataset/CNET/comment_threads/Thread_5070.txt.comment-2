but rather a firewall and network configuration.. just a thought, can you filter the internet access using a mac address (from the router)... --do not include that particular machine mac address-- This way .. networking still available for everyone, and internet access only available for registered mac address..
I might be wrong though... but I know someone that use a linux based gateway server.. where you can configured many things with the ultility called webmin(?)
