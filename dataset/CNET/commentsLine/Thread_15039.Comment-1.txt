what's the best method to clean out my old hard drives of data and viruses for reuse?
i have some older internal hard drives that i'd like to convert into external drives so i can use them for backups on my new machine.
now some of these drives have viruses and malware on them and i'd like to completely wipe them free of them so they will not come back to bite me.
should i use an antivirus like avast to quarantine the viruses and malware first, and then use cc cleaner to do a single-pass setting and reformat the drive?
would that be efficient enough?
or is there a better method to reformat these drives to ensure they are clean and ready for reuse?
bottom line: what would you do?
thanks in advance for the advice!
