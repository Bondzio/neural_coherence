<s> Okay, I put together my first computer and triple checked everyhthing and thought it was all fine but when I plugged it up this seriously high pitched noise started coming from inside the case. </s>
<s> I had the side of the case off and I could see the fans and lights inside the power source start turning, and also the fan on the processor start turning, but after a few seconds the sound quit and so did my computer. </s>
<s> There was a small burning smell coming from the power source (at least I think it was the power source). </s>
<s> I guess I should have turned it off when the horrible screeching started, but here's what I tried next: I plugged an extra power source I had into the motherboard and hit the on switch and the same noise started, so I quickly turned it off. </s>
<s> I can still do this, every time I hit the switch the noise starts and the fans start. </s>
<s> I tried plugging a third power source in, one from a computer I have been using for a year or so now, and here's the funny thing: the light that shows the power source is plugged in will flicker repeatedly and never stay fully lit, just flicker. </s>
<s> So I get flicker with one power source, a loud screeching sound with another, and nothing from the one I initially started with. </s>
<s> I stripped the motherboard of everything (video card, hard drive, cd-rom) and still get this noise. </s>
<s> Is my motherboard fried? </s>
<s> Or have I overlooked something else simple? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Since you didn't really say what type of pc or components you built this pc with, (hint hint) I can only guess that you either hooked something very wrong or your power supply was old, broke, or new and malfunctioning. </s>
<s> In either case, you should have shut it down right away and asked for help then. </s>
<s> This may have saved you some heartache. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> No I am pretty sure I hooked everything up right... Raidmax Power Supply 450W Athlon 64 3200+ Asus 939-DualSata2 motherboard XFX GForce 6800GT 8X AGP video card that's about all I had in there... except for the cd drive and the hard drive, and I know I had those hooked up right too. </s>
<s> If I fried it, why would it be doing the same thing when I put the second power supply in there? </s>
<s> Shouldn't it just do nothing at all? </s>
<s> And what about the flickering of the old power supply? </s>
<s> If I did fry it, what all do I need to replace, just the motherboard and power supply or could it have fried my video card, dvd drive, and hard drive too? </s>
<s> And RAM ? </s>
<s> Well, it's like this, you need to find where the burning smell was coming from. </s>
<s> Check the motherboard over for bulging capacitors, burn spots etc...Also check your vid card, ram slots, ram, on the connections etc... </s>
<s> Check all wires and connections, see if you can get a visual of any damage. </s>
<s> If the power supply was faulty, then you probably fried something so don't be too surprised. </s>
<s> You may not have fried any cards or ram but it's possible you did. </s>
<s> My instincts tell me your power supply was bad or you definately didn't hook something up correctly. </s>
<s> You have compatable parts, i see that. </s>
<s> There is a possibility the motherboard was bad also, this does happen. </s>
<s> I can't visualize how you hooked everything and where without actually looking it over, so it's difficult to tell. </s>
<s> You may or may not have shorted out something from improper handling and when you plugged it in, it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> ESD electro static discharge can ruin a chip or circuit on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Let me know if you find anything. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Okay I don't see any burn spots or any bulging capacitors or anything... </s>
<s> I am almost definate also that the burning smell (although very faint) was coming from the power suppy. </s>
<s> I don't think it was faulty though, since the same noise is being made with the second power supply (the one that came with my case, I hooked it up after this incident). </s>
<s> One thing that comes to mind is a note that is in the motherboard manual and a sticker on the AGP slot that said not to use 3.3V AGP card with the motherboard... </s>
<s> I don't think my card was 3.3V (I had read some motherboard reviews of people who had used the same card and gotten good results). </s>
<s> So how can I test each individual part to see what the problem is for sure? </s>
<s> The RAM was in my previous PC, so I am pretty sure that's not the problem. </s>
<s> I don't have an AGP slot on my other motherboard, so how can I tell if its the video card? </s>
<s> Also, why would my other working power source which came from my old PC only flicker instead of getting full power when I hook it up? </s>
<s> It seems like all signs to me (although I don't know very much about this) point to a bad motherboard I guess... if you guys can help me determine that this was the cause it be greatly appreciated and I could send it back to get a replacement... thanks for all the help. </s>
<s> I forgot to ask this in my last post... could it be possible that I damaged the processor? </s>
<s> I know that the fan works every time I plug the power in (with the screeching sound) so does that mean some part of the motherboard is actually working? </s>
<s> What puzzles me is that with everything, there is only one way to plug them in... the molexes for the power and stuff only clip one way, and I made sure the IDE ribbons were on the right pins with the red stripe on the correct side... besides that and my video card, there wasn't anything else plugged in. </s>
<s> I know, I ask a lot of questions! </s>
<s> Nothing wrong with asking, how else do you get answers, right? </s>
<s> Yes your processor could be done for. </s>
<s> I wanted to ask you though, what type of ram did you install? </s>
<s> The wrong ram will cause major grief if not the proper type. </s>
<s> Is is pc 133? </s>
<s> 100? </s>
<s> DDR etc...? </s>
<s> And what type does your motherboard call for? </s>
<s> This may be a major problem and you need to check this for sure. </s>
<s> Also, they say you can't install ram wrong, well i have seen people force it into a slot incorrectly and it fries the whole system. </s>
<s> Just enough of the connectors in the slots wrong and boof, there it goes. </s>
<s> The fact you smelled something burning doesn't give me a lot of hope though and even if getting it up and going, what future problems will arise? </s>
<s> If it was the power supply, you may still have a burt system which putting another power supply on won't do any good. </s>
<s> Check your Ram and make sure the slots line up exactly, check that it's the exact type that will work in your motherboard. </s>
<s> Now, some pcs when first run, can get a smell to them, almost a burning smell, this is due to all the parts heating up. </s>
<s> If you saw smoke though, not good. </s>
<s> One more thing, just because you didn't see any physical damage, doesn't mean there isn't. </s>
<s> Let me know, Paul </s>
<s> But if all else fails you might as well seek professional help. </s>
<s> I understand the fact that you have built your own pc, but if you can't detect a problem and you keep continuing on this path of trying to resurrect your pc, then you might damage other components in the pc; forcing you to spend more money on the same components. </s>
<s> See and look around. </s>
<s> Might as well check how much it will cost. </s>
<s> See if this makes any sense to you all... </s>
<s> I am using the power source now that came with the case (420W) and I plugged it into my motherboard. </s>
<s> I stripped everything (IDE cables, video card, RAM) so the only thing now that I have is the power source and processor plugged into my motherboard. </s>
<s> When I turn the switch on the back of my power source to ON, the fan spins on the processor and then stops (i figure this is where the computer isn't on and just getting power for a few seconds or something). </s>
<s> Earlier today when I did this same test I got that loud screeching noise, but that is when I had everything plugged in. </s>
<s> Does the fact that the fan is spinning mean my motherboard could be alright? </s>
<s> Also, this is something I forgot to ask and it may or may not have anything to do with this, but I may have had the &quot;POWER SW&quot; plug in the wrong spot earlier. </s>
<s> I had the positive side in a &quot;PRWBTN&quot; plug with the negative side grounded... the only other spots I had open were HDDLED, PWRLED, and nothing else really so I decided this was where it had to go. </s>
<s> Could that have something to do with this? </s>
<s> I never attempted to turn the computer on by the power button. </s>
<s> All the events that happened earlier just happened when the power source turned on. </s>
<s> Okay, let me try to answer all these: 1) It takes DDR400, which is what I put in... they were installed correctly also, I made sure to put the break in the right spot and everything... the ram is now in my old PC again and is working fine. </s>
<s> 2) I didn't see any smoke, and it wasn't a strong burning smell, it may be the heating up of the parts as you say. </s>
<s> 3) I have checked the entire motherboard for any spots of burns, damage, anything... can't see any, I know that doesn't mean there isn't any though. </s>
<s> Ok I think I have this figured out now. </s>
<s> To follow up my last post, I turned the computer on with the old power source and everything runs fine (although I can't see anything since I don't have a monitor hooked up) which brings me to my dilemma. </s>
<s> I unplugged the power and put the video card in, and turned it back on, and I got a small beep like the one before but it quits now, and I can't turn the computer on by the button in the front anymore. </s>
<s> I have read other reviews of the motherboard with people using the NVidia GeForce 6800GT with no problems but none with the XFX brand... could it be that this brand is 3.3V, the type that my motherboard said it did not support? </s>
<s> It's nearly impossible for that card to be 3.3v and for it to have fit in the 1.5 slot. </s>
<s> AGP cards are keyed to only fit in a voltage compatible slot (there are exceptions from off beat manufacturers) besides, there's no such things as a 8x 3.3v agp card. </s>
<s> If anyone knows of one let me know so i can tell peole to stay away from it, the manufacturer is lying to you. </s>
<s> As for the Raidmax power supply, pull it out of the machine, walk over to the trash can and put that piece of junk where it belongs, with the rest of the garbage. </s>
<s> Harsh? </s>
<s> Not hardly, I swap out out more of those PSU's than any other brand ten to one including $20 generic brands. </s>
<s> The rails are &quot;the&quot; most unstable I've ever seen. </s>
<s> It definitely gets my vote for worst PSU ever made. </s>
<s> The longest I've ver seen one last was 6 months and even that was suprising. </s>
<s> So, your probably not encouraged by my rant, but I can tell you that it is rare that even that bad psu will damage system comonents. </s>
<s> Usually the fuse just blows. </s>
<s> The screeching and burning smell is not so encouraging. </s>
<s> The burning smell could have come from the psu, I've smelled them burn when they over power the fuse so much it actually breaks the glass tube. </s>
<s> You'll get a burned smell then. </s>
<s> A psu is not difficult to open, you just have to be careful about metal tools and the large side by side cylinders inside (the capacitors) these hold enough chrge to at the very least send yo packing to the hospital. </s>
<s> You'd almost have to do it on purpose though. </s>
<s> Inside you'll find on the board of the psu, a fuse, no doubt blown. </s>
<s> If it's in fact broken, that was the source, or one of the sources of the burning smell. </s>
<s> You stated that you had the sysem up and running minus the video card. </s>
<s> That's a really good sign, the memory, board, and CPU at the very least are funtioning properly it seems. </s>
<s> Did you stick your nose against the side of the heatsink on the card and see if it smelleed burned? </s>
<s> Try that, if it does I have bad news, your GPU is probably toast, just the thought of a Fried 6800 GT GPU particularly on a xfx board hurts me. </s>
<s> I feel the pain on that one. </s>
<s> you'll have to try the card in another agp board. </s>
<s> Cleaning the pins could also help. </s>
<s> Feel free to contact me if you'd like more info. </s>
<s> GOOD LUCK! </s>
<s> So, this IS the same psu that everyone is complaining about. </s>
<s> Brand new, fries instantly? </s>
<s> Have to keep this in mind. </s>
<s> Thought I saw it somewhere in a couple of other posts but couldn't find them. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> If you hook a positive to a negative\ vice versa, you obviously know what can happen now. </s>
<s> All you can do is cross your fingers and hope you didn't burn something up. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Honestly, what I would do in your situation is simply try to send the motherboard back at this point,(if they will even take it) try to get a good psu, and chalk it up to , oops, hooked up the psu wrong, won't ever do it again. </s>
<s> There can be unseen damage on your motherboard at this point. </s>
<s> hope all goes well, Paul </s>
<s> the suggestion that you bring back the mobo to try to swap for a new one is sound advice, but beware the crooked looks you'll get from the vendor. </s>
<s> Asus boards rarely have problems. </s>
<s> Just make sure you're a good actor, and tell him to test it himself. </s>
<s> &quot;Yeah I know I couldn't beieve it either, that why I bought an Asus board, I've been using them for years.&quot; Usually works. </s>
<s> Yes, I should have added, IF it ideed was the motherboard causing the problem. </s>
<s> (which I can pretty much say it wasnt').I have nothing against Asus, have heard pretty good things about them. </s>
<s> Thanks for pointing that out though,as we get fogetful sometimes and don't write what we should. </s>
<s> Take care, Paul </s>
<s> Okay, I've listened to what everyone said and thanks for all the opinions and information... here is finally what I have come to: Right now, I have everything plugged into my motherboard except the video card. </s>
<s> I have my hard drive, cd-drive, the RAM, the processor and its fan, the power switch, the case speaker, the HDD LED and Power LED, pretty much the whole works except for my video card. </s>
<s> Since I have no display (no monitor hookup on my motherboard, just on the video card) I have no clue what is going on after I turn the computer on and therefore no way to set everything up or tell if there has been any damage to the motherboard/processor. </s>
<s> It seems to me like since everything APPEARS to run fine without the video card in, but then when I put it in and attempt to turn on the computer I get this loud screeching sound, the video card or the AGP slot has to be the problem. </s>
<s> The fact that my power source doesn't work anymore, yet my old one seems to be working everything fine, leads me to believe that my power source was the burningw smell and that I've burnt it up. </s>
<s> I'm going to attempt to send it back and get a replacement at New Egg. </s>
<s> So this leads me to my final bit of questions: What I was going to do is go buy one of those real cheap video card from Wal-mart (they are around 29.99 or something) and hook it into the motherboard and see if I get the same screeching sound or if I actually can get a display. </s>
<s> If so, then that definately means the video card was the problem, right? </s>
<s> Is this a good idea? </s>
<s> NOTE: the beeping sound appeared to be coming from the area on the motherboard around the processor. </s>
<s> I'm not sure that's what it was coming from, but if so, how will I know if my processor is burnt up? </s>
<s> If it is, and since the motherboard is hooked up exactly the same right now as it was (meaning earlier when it made the crazy sound that I indeed had it hooked up correctly), could it be that there was indeed something faulty with my motherboard since everything was hooked up correctly? </s>
<s> Since I have a compatible video card and everything was hooked up right, I don't know what could have went wrong. </s>
<s> Geek Squad guys don't know squat but they can run a diagnostic on your computer to see what components are messed up. </s>
<s> I just had it done for $59. </s>
<s> Its a rip off but if I hadn't gone to them, I wouldn't know my Powersupply is messed up. </s>
<s> If I had only bought a new Mo Bo and Processor they would have been destoryed the instant I turned the thing on. </s>
<s> $59 bucks saved me $320. </s>
<s> For one, there is no guarantee, something else isn't wrong if the power supply went bad and the fact that you confirmed you hooked it wrong. </s>
<s> Since already trying it, you need to get a monitor hooked up or else it's just a guessing game. </s>
<s> There may have been damage anywhere from the cpu through the bus lines to the agp slot and then card also. </s>
<s> Even if buying a different card, you run the risk of frying it also. </s>
<s> All it takes is one tiny short to ruin a lot of things on a motherboard. </s>
<s> I would have to suggest taking it to a liscensed technican and have them test the motherboard for you. </s>
<s> This is the safest way to be sure there is no damage to it. </s>
<s> I think that would be your only safe option currently. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> No, I didn't confirm hooking up anythign wrong, in fact everything was hooked up correctly and I am 100% sure on this. </s>
<s> The only thing which I was questionable about was the &quot;POWER SW&quot; coming from the case to the motherboard but I can now confirm it was in the right spot... the power button on the front will turn the machine on and off. </s>
<s> So now, I have everything (and did have everything) hooked up correctly, yet I got the screeching sound and the power supply burnt up. </s>
<s> So does this in fact mean the motherboard was bad? </s>
<s> If nothing was hooked up incorrectly, it had to be one of the two... motherboard or video card. </s>
<s> Yes after rereading I see you thought you might have hooked it up wrong. </s>
<s> Still this isn't a might be motherboard and video card only issue. </s>
<s> Your other power supply may still have caused this. </s>
<s> As I mentioned, you have no monitor to see if the pc is in fact working at all, you or I have no way to test the motherboard. </s>
<s> Every time you hook something up, you take a chance of damaging it further. </s>
<s> I know it's frustrating but as I said before, you really need to take the motherboard in and have it checked along with the power supply to see what happened here. </s>
<s> And please take this advice, if ever building a pc again, do not go with a cheap power supply, do not hook up another one if one had failed as you can do more damage to the motherboard. </s>
<s> You had already done this before you asked for help or else I would have told you to take it in for a test and strictly to not plug it in or hook up a power supply again. </s>
<s> All I or anyone else can do is guess and that won't get you results. </s>
<s> It needs to be put on a tester. </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> I resemble.......I mean resent that remark about Geek Squad...I'm CIA, but I have to admit you're right, the guys I work with are useless, anything beyond installing apps and they have to bring it to me. </s>
<s> Well, I guess I don't want to take any chances, and since I am 100% sure now that everything was hooked up correctly then I supposed that I will send everything back to New Egg and ask for replacements. </s>
<s> There is nowhere around where I live or even in a 3 hour vicinity that I can get a diagnostics done... </s>
<s> Beleive me, I live up north and to get to a good hospital it takes an hour, I know how you feel. </s>
<s> You may have had every thing hooked right but don't forget about that powersupply either, may have been bad. </s>
<s> Also, did you have to install the cpu yourself or was it already on the motherboard? </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> I had to install the CPU. </s>
<s> I am sure I put that in right though, I matched it up just like the manual said... plus they only fit one way, right? </s>
<s> And I didn't have to force it or anything. </s>
<s> did you put the heat sink compound on? </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Yes, it came with it... the fan/heatsink. </s>
<s> That was my last thought if having a heat problem etc...Sounds like you did your homework and unfortunately the dog ate it. </s>
<s> I wish you luck with sending everything back and hope it goes better the second time around. </s>
<s> Take care, Paul </s>
<s> Thanks to all the help, you and everyone else who replied and helped me solve this problem... without you guys I wouldn't have had a clue </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Okay, New Egg wouldn't accept any return except for the power supply so the replacement is on its way... so in the mean time i am in a predicament. </s>
<s> I bought a cheap video card from Wal-mart (ATI Radeon 9500 AGP) and installed it into the motherboard, turned the power on, and there was no beeping screeching sound like there was before, everything was running and seemed to be fine. </s>
<s> I get no display on my monitor though when hooking it up through the card on VGA... is there something I have done wrong? </s>
<s> Or could this be the affect of damage done to my motherboard? </s>
<s> Is there some ways I can test this now that I have the video card in without problems but get no display? </s>
<s> What does the status light on the monitor do? </s>
<s> They usually are all universal: Green Steady is Power and Input. </s>
<s> Yello/orange Steady is Power and no input. </s>
<s> Green Blinking is a weird one: I think it means Power and Input but its like in standby. </s>
<s> When I have the green light blinking, rarely, I just unplug and replug the cables; reboot: Done. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim </s>
<s> I'm looking at a pic of your mobo and seeing some extra slots: What slots do you have; like left to right or whatever. </s>
<s> This one has a AGP AND a PCI-X 16 (in the picture) Maybe not. </s>
<s> If you can, just tell me the slots. </s>
<s> Thanks ~Ibrahim </s>
<s> No blinking green light, just the orange light... Also, yeah I have the PCI-express and AGP slots, I got the motherboard that had both so I could use the AGP card I already had and get PCIe later... too bad that isn't turning out too well. </s>
