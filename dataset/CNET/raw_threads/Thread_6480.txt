5377	0	307768	2852918	NR	Jim41	9/8/08 11:30 AM	1.2208734E12	Help me find a network HD	There are four PCs in the house, all running XP and all with wireless Internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the DSL modem. The router has several RJ45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and I'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the PCs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files. I have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc. to specify. Ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently. Can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware? Thanks.
