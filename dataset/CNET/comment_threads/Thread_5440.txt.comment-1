Help the motherboard in my computer is broken.
How should I upgrade?
What the computer currenly has is a MSI motherboard, don't know what MSI though.
Graphics card is radion 9800.
The computer is custom made.
For now I'm just going to upgrade the motherboard.
In the future I will upgrade the whole computer.
I will reuse the power supply and disc drives.
What new MSI mother board is a good choice?
