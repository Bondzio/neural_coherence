I am not up on the latest processor technology but would be interested to know what is the best bang for the buck in processors. I'm not into gaming or photo editing, just typical PC applications and web surfing. I plan to go to Vista so I want to make sure I get a decent enough machine to handle it. So is there a sweet spot($)in processors that I should look for in a desktop. Thanks in advance

The E6600 fits my definition of a CPU sweetspot (4MB L2 cache). It is the cheapest with 4MB cache, which translates into a nice performance bump. Spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump. Check the CPU CHARTS at TomsHardware.com for performance scores. Now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be....
