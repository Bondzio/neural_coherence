<s> If you are using integrated graphics on a motherboard and they go out, does the entire motherboard go out too? </s>
<s> If not caused by a burnout that results in physical damage, you can just buy a new video card that fits a compatible slot and use that. </s>
<s> Of course you'd want to disable the on board video so it's not detected by the OS. </s>
<s> Alot depends on the damage. </s>
<s> If all damage is wholly to the video sector of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> you may get by installing a video card to continue on. </s>
<s> However, if the damage also includes more of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> then 2ndary issues arise, you're pretty much hosed. </s>
<s> If you're capable try fixing the mtrbd. </s>
<s> but in this day and age that maybe easier to try than actually get done. </s>
<s> Also, the bios comes into play if it can disallow the on-board video in order to use the video card as some need a bios setting to do so, though others are more auto-setting once a video card is installed. </s>
<s> This is a mute point if you can't see a display. </s>
