<s> Hi We have i-Mac 20&quot; with built in i-sight Power PC, one of last ones I think before the intel. </s>
<s> We have had a few problems before with it powering down and going to sleep. </s>
<s> Used to hoover dust out and that seemed to fix it. </s>
<s> Now it won't start at all. </s>
<s> I have tried all the PRAM and various commands to re set various things but none of these work. </s>
<s> We had a wireless keyboard and I have just tried a wired one but I do not think either are connecting as the tab key light does not come on, which it does when I tested the wired on on my lap top. </s>
<s> When it died it crashed with a cd in drive. </s>
<s> I have removed this and replaced it with the mac install disk to try and run the disk check but the optical drive is not starting at all either. </s>
<s> All that happens on start up is the sleep light comes on, then after a few moments fan starts to whirl. </s>
<s> I can''t hear the hard drive - have tried to rock hard drive to get it to spin but nothing. </s>
<s> Just wondering whether worth trying to replace optical drive or is this being controlled by hard drive - hence its not working nor hard drive. </s>
<s> is there any way to recover data if it is the hard drive that is dead? </s>
<s> anything else I can try and replace to fix it? </s>
<s> could I use an external optical drive connected via USB to start? </s>
<s> I have tried to firewire but not joy their either! </s>
<s> Many Thanks John </s>
<s> what response did you get? </s>
<s> Any attempt at powering up? </s>
<s> Powered up but did not actually boot? </s>
<s> Flashing question mark? </s>

<s> Hi Screen remains off, sleep light comes on. </s>
<s> Little to no noise, no clicking hard drive or anything. </s>
<s> Then fans starts in about 4 minutes - its like its never awoken from sleep! </s>
<s> The only thing I can think to do is take hard drive out - see if that works and recover data.I am nw wondering may be its a logic board failure? </s>
<s> they seem pricey enough to replace and not sure if worth it on 6 year old mac? </s>

<s> Just three captive screws on the bottom and the whole back just lifts off. </s>
<s> Everything is accessible from there. </s>
<s> Removing the HD is certainly an option, from your description it is probably just fine. </s>
<s> Try this before removing the drive. </s>
<s> Remove the back, remove the little battery and leave for 20 minutes. </s>
<s> Put the battery back in, replace the back, keyboard and mouse & power cord. </s>
<s> Try to start it. </s>
<s> If you get a reaction, good. </s>
<s> If not proceed to remove the HD and recover data before doing anything else. </s>
<s> It may be possible to get a replacement board but, given the age of this machine, it may be time to consider a newer iMac. </s>

<s> Hi thanks for that - where is the battery I haven't tried that - its a g5 imac isight, so quite tricky inside? </s>
<s> many thanks </s>
<s> had a case change and is not so easy to get into. </s>
<s> If you have never tried this before, I would advise against it. </s>
<s> On these models, it is not the back that comes off, it's the front, and it is held in by some clever clips that require a bent piece of flat, fairly rigid, thin plastic. </s>
<s> It is doable though, just really tricky I could send you instructions if you decide to proceed. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Hi I am in, have removed hard drive just would like to try the battery fix but can not see for the life of me where its is. </s>
<s> I am guessing it is under something else I need to take off? </s>
<s> I think I will need a special screw driver - done ok so far but some of these screws in side I am struggling with - if you can tell me where battery is that would be great Thanks J </s>
<s> that's where Apple says the battery is located. </s>
<s> It is one of those disk shaped batterys P </s>
<s> Thanks I am going to buy the special screw drivers. </s>
<s> I am guessing that part is under the main body so I am going to have to pull more stuff out! </s>
<s> Ugh J </s>
