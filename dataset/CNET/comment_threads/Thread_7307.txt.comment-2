Step 2.
So far, with NO EXCEPTIONS the BIOS must show the drive.
Any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience.
Your product = http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&product=424351 I see that you might enable a THIRD MASTER in the BIOS at http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1144192 However unless you find a document with the BIOS screen shots, this is as far as I go.
Plan B.
Install some card like this -&gt; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815124020 but beware that many don't want to flash the BIOS for the IDE emulation so it will work.
