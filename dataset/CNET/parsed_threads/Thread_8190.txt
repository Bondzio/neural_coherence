<s> I have an old HP Compaq Presario Laptop (Sempron-CPU) which has an ATI Mobility Radeon express series 200 graphics card. </s>
<s> XPHome SP-2. </s>
<s> I have a driver dated Dec/2005 (8.202.0.0) for it, and is the latest, as far as I know. </s>
<s> I have located an Newer &quot;AMD Catalyst&quot; driver, which indicates that their driver supports my Graphics card. </s>
<s> Since ATI is AMD now, my guess is that it may be OK. </s>
<s> I hate to guess about things like this, and am just inquiring here. </s>
<s> Can anyone verify that the Catalyst drivers are OK with my old laptop ? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> and if a newer driver for your Radeon card is posted on their support site, it should be safe to use. </s>
<s> These are coming as the Catalyst suite or just the driver. </s>
<s> I never get the full suite. </s>
<s> What you'll want to do is read up on what's been fixed or what new features have been added that you'd find useful. </s>
<s> If you're having no known video problems that have been addressed or find no features that are important to you, you're well enough along to leave things as they are. </s>
<s> If you want to go ahead and install the new driver/software anyway, don't delete the old driver. </s>
<s> Occasionally bugs are created as well as fixed. </s>
<s> Thanks, for the good advice. </s>
<s> This was my first inquiry about it. </s>
<s> Best to do some research, on my part, before jumping on it. </s>
<s> Will try to post back with any success. </s>
<s> Thanks, again. </s>
