i got it.
used  i had to enable file sharing on &quot;both&quot; computers.
then restart both machines.
worked fine.
i was able to transfer and share folders between each.
by the way, the dlink (di-624 router) worked fine out of the box.
i called support about upgrading the firmware because one update on the vdi624(revc3) which i have, said do not update firmware.
contact your isp for an upgrade.
there is another upgrade but dlink support tech told me not to do any of them?
wonder why?
