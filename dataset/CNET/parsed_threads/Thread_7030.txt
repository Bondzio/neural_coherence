<s> Hi, Wondering if anyone knows a tablet program that would allow one to write into a standard form text file questionaire that has pre-typed items then convert what is written into text? </s>
<s> It's for work. </s>
<s> Example: (pre-typed) What are a few of your favorite colors? </s>
<s> (In this space hoping to write below the text with a stylus): blue, green, red Then what I write gets converted to text, in he proper position: (result) What are a few of your favorite colors? </s>
<s> Blue, green, red </s>
<s> It would need to be able to handle conversion of up to a few paragraphs of stylus writing into text into a standardized pre-typed form. </s>
<s> Does this exist? </s>
<s> And no writing, just multiple choice? </s>
<s> Rather search for you, did you search for SURVEY TOOLS on the App Store or Play market? </s>

<s> Basically I need it for documenting patient history and physical exams The template would be something like this: chief complaint: (a few words) History of present illness: (a few sentences) Past medical History: (words) Etc Some portions would look like this with checkboxes: ()hyperthyroidism ()hypertension ()diabetes ()cancer ()CHF ()pneumonia ()etc ()etc ()etc I was hoping to find a program for a tablet so its less &quot;cold or rude&quot; when doing patient interviews to be typing while interviewing and yet still be able to write it out while I'm actually talking to the patient otherwise I can be left with several patient notes to write several hours later that will take several hours to do versus getting them done on the spot but I am starting to think what I'm looking for doesn't exist yet, or that it won't work as well as I need it to. </s>
<s> If you look at written text to plain text I don't see any advancements or offerings. </s>
<s> It's as if the industry has regressed. </s>
<s> Maybe what you want is the new Microsoft Slate with a real keyboard? </s>
