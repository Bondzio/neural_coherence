Hi all, I recently purchased (a second hand) HP Lefthand P4500 machine with 12 3.5&quot; SAS/SATA bays. When I try inserting any electro-mechanical Hard Drives into the bays, they have a small orange light (instead of green) glowing in their respective LED indicators. When I go into the RAID configuration, I am unable to see any of the disks... I tried inserting 12 hard disks - 10 x 1 TB WD hdds and 2 x SSDs and only the two SSDs were recognized. The configuration of my machine is as follows: Quad Core AMD Opteron Processor x 1 4 GB DDR2 RAM HP Smart Array P400/256MB Controller iLO100i Can someone help me out with this please? I am in need of getting this SAN box up and running for my project completion... (I hope I am posting the question in the right forum, if not, please pardon...) Thanks very much in advance. Regards, Krish
