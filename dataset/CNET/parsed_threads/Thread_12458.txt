<s> I have a PVC-RS 420 running XP. </s>
<s> Of course the power supply is bad and it is impossible to find one any place that I have looked. </s>
<s> I even wrote the manufacter, Delta electronics. </s>
<s> No Response!! </s>
<s> What I would like to know is, has anyone adapted a standard good quality more powerful run of the mill ATX power supply to the Sony. </s>
<s> I was considering trying it and just wanted to know if I'm getting in over my head. </s>
<s> any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> Look up PC POWER AND COOLING on google.com If you look around the site you'll find full mechanical specs for stock ATX power supplies. </s>
<s> From that you can measure and see if the unit will replace yours. </s>
