For the price you seek this is the best you can get. And much more, you will have support for the last optimizations in games. (sorry for my english)

The X1600Pro is comparable to a 6600GT, if not better. My X1300Pro plays Call of Duty 2, BF2, Half-life 2, Age of Empires 3, and more on medium settings with no noticeable lag. The X1600Pro will be even better with 12 pixel pipelines and a higher clock. However I'd buy this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130263 $99 after $30 rebate. Just look around at newegg.com and set yourself a budget and see what's the best deal.
