On my desktop, I am running XP, a program called Windows Disk has just started up, which says i have (suddenly) developed loads of problems with my hard drive.
It wants to take me to the Advanced Module to fix these faults and take money from me for a licence.
Is this some sort of scam?
Do I really have problems with my hard drive?
Thanks Colin
