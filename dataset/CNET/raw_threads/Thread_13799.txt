When I play games I get a BSOD STOP 0x0000001E. It occurred to me I didn't install all my drivers or the new BIOS for my system since updating to Windows 7 64-bit. I have installed all current hardware drivers, but when I try to install the BIOS it says it is not compatible with 64-bit and to contact the company. I have contacted them, but without a reply. Is windows just saying it isn't compatible when I try to run the update in windows, but really is compatible if I used a disk to update the bios? Thank you! http://www.gigabyte.us/Support/Motherboard/Driver_Model.aspx?ProductID=2914

I'm not trying to offend you but if you think back just a few years such updates were done with DOS boot diskettes for years and arcane command lines. It's improved but I have no qualms with a boot CD or diskette to do this update. Bob

I was trying to ask if, since I tried to update the BIOS within Windows, would it give me a message stating the BIOS update was not compatible with 64-bit windows, EVEN THOUGH it was actually compatible IF I used an alternative method to Windows. So in essence, should I try to update the BIOS with a USB drive (since that's all I have) even though when I tried to update within Windows it said it was not compatible? Hopefully that's a little more clear.
