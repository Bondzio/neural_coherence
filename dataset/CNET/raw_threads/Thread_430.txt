9007	1	7656	89781	89622	R. Proffitt	1/6/04 3:50 PM	1.0734042E12	I have this USB Floppy I use in a pinch. On my machine I can even boot from it.	But the sad truth is that I don't see such a card. The issue here is that a motherboard could cost about the same. What motherboard is this? What CPU and such parts do you need to move over? Bob

What i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy, particularly, the media sensor. If this stays down in a stuck position, the drive thinks it has a 720 disk, but your command has told it that it was a 1.44, therefore you may get a message &quot;cannot read, disk not formatted etc.&quot; A little WD-40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches, and often puts the drive back in service. Its worth a try, I fixed one this past weekend for a friend. Norm

The old one was using an LS120 [IDE] drive as the floppy. This was needed for the new computer which had the old hard drive with Quickbooks on it. Used it to back up Quickbooks. Now two years ago, this same idiot disabled the Floppy controller because at that time the system didn't have a floppy drive. Guess what happened when i enabled the floppy controller in the BIOS. Now I have an ISA controller that can handle a bunch of floppies. Anyone need it??
