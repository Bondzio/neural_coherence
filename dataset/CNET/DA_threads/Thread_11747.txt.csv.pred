1.1.1	At the moment my computer doesn't recognise when devices are plugged into my usb ports (not a hub).	St
1.1.2	So now my printer, MP3 player and External hardrive aren't recognised when they are plugged in.	St
1.1.3	This has happened without them being removed or in any way altered.	St
1.1.4	I run Windows XP SP2 and all unused USB ports in the device manager claim they are working properly, however when i get to the &quot;unkown device&quot; (my printer and.or external hardrive - both are listed as unknown devices) I get told the drivers aren't installed - yet when i try to intall them the computer won't recognise the device i want to install drivers to..........any ideas?	St
1.2.1	the motherboard USB drivers.	St
1.2.2	Have you installed them?	St
1.2.3	Your question is very light on system information so that's about all I can say.	St
1.3.1	Well luckily its all come back and it's working now - but i expect sumthing to go wrong soon because it did this before.	St
1.3.2	It wouldn't recognise the printer and external h/d and just came back at a random time - which doesnt help because i dont what the cause is!	St
