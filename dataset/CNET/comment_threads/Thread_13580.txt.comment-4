I'd reset the BIOS settings and change what you needed to the time you set it up.
The 3GB is sadly less with XP.
Even with that /3GB boot.ini switch I found very few apps that were compiled for that so we still get the usual 2.1 to 3.5GB used by the OS and 2.0GB per app tops.
This is a sad story of an upgrade that should have been forgotten about.
How you can find your way back to the old setup.
