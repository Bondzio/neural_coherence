1.1.1	My iOmega LDHD-UP2 , 2TB , External Hard Drive works fine when I plug it in and the files ( mainly videos ) run properly .	St
1.1.2	I have divided my 2TB into two partitions ( let 's say U drive & amp ; ME drive ) , nearly 1TB each .	St
1.1.3	Both the partition is formatted as NTFS .	St
1.1.4	The problem is that the ME drive that has all videos , about 10GB , does not copy files properly anymore .	St
1.1.5	Any file size over 500MB will start copying and eventually the copying speed rate decreases dramatically , most of the times from 100MB/s to 2MB/s , and just stops without moving any further when it 's about 10 - 20 sec left to complete the transfer of data ( videos ) .	St
1.1.6	I have tried waiting for the completion of data transfer for more than 5 hours for just 1.5GB File .	St
1.1.7	The light on the External Hard Drive blinks very fast and stops blinking randomly when the transfer stops/ freezes .	St
1.1.8	To fix this problem I have tried Defragmentation of the ME drive , tried USB Update , tired Error-checking , virus scan for both the drives ( U & amp ; ME ) and also recently copied all my 10GB worth or data on to my desktop , formatted the ME drive again with NTFS and copied back all the files .	St
1.1.9	It was working fine until i copied all the files but then soon after a day passed by the same problem occurred in the ME drive .	St
1.1.10	Since the transfer of data stops , I try to cancel the transfer , its loads for 2+ hours and does not close/ cancel .	St
1.1.11	This leads me to unplug the USB from my computer without ejecting the drive .	St
1.1.12	Meanwhile the U drive with just about 5GB of data works perfectly fine when copying big media files Is it because of the space used ?	Ques
1.1.13	even then i have about 980GB of free space on my ME drive !	St
1.1.14	My Computer configuration : Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit 650 Intel Core i5 processor 8GB DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT320 1024MB So please if anyone had any solutions or suggestions for my problems I 'll be so thankful for you ...	St
1.2.1	I 'd run Chkdsk and let it check for and attempt repair of bad sectors .	St
1.2.2	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	Add a note about backup before that step .	St
1.3.2	As the drive may have an issue , CHKDSK may push it over the cliff before they had a chance to save their files .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	Just now i finished with the Checking Disk and also Defragmentation , but the problem still occurs .	St
1.4.2	It copies to a certain limit and it freezes , Light on the HDD blinking very fast , the & quot ; Time remaining & quot ; says & quot ; calculating ... & quot ; and the & quot ; Speed & quot ; stays as 135MB/sec without any change .	St
1.5.1	from Seagate or Western Digital .	St
1.5.2	They have some good ones .	St
1.5.3	If you should buy another external hard drive , I 'd recommend one of those two brands .	St
1.5.4	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	We know there are limits to the file count in the root directory .	St
1.6.2	We also know that as you put more and more files in a folder the speed steps down every 250 or 500 files .	St
1.6.3	There 's a lesson there .	St
1.6.4	An old one .	St
1.6.5	Do the disk test AFTER you have your files safe .	St
