I understand the processing power will be greater but how about the price range?
(price maximum of $300) What speeds do they operate at?
Do you know where I can find information on this product?
Also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core?
Another question unrelated to CPUs, do you suggest that I buy a PCI express motherboard and gcard?
I'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but I'm not sure of the agps longevity.
