i followed your advice.
in addition, i eliminated a large hp media file.in the process of doing this, norton 360 (which said updates exceeded my capacity) basically deleted and re-installed.
i also found a program (lenovo hard drive quick test) which now shows the following results: drive capacity 18.63 gb- buffer 1.70 gb- volume capacity- 14.39 gb, used capacity 13.44 gb.
since the above actions, i haven't been on that pc much to see if the problems have been eliminated, but if the above figures are accurate, i now should have adequate memory for my purposes.
ram memory- per belarc analysis shows 64 kilobyte primary memory-primary and 512 kilobyte secondary.
would replacing the 64 kilobyte be advisable?
