<s> Last night, I turned the computer on but did not login, this morrning, I heard the computer making weird noises, and became extremely slow. </s>
<s> So I was not sure what was wrong, and decided to turn the computer off and restart. </s>
<s> But I was not able to start Windows XP, not even Safe Mode in Command Prompt. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what could possbily be wrong with this computer? </s>
<s> Without hearing the noise but adding the slowdown I wonder if some FAN has failed. </s>
<s> How old and are you planning to replace the fan yourself? </s>
<s> The computer is an old desktop that I bought in 2001, so I have not really had any plan to replace the fan. </s>
<s> Currently when I try to turn on my computer, it just makes really loud fan(?) </s>
<s> sound, that I usually only hear for about 20 seconds when the computer is started or when I run larger applications. </s>
<s> Given the age it's likely a maintenance issue. </s>
<s> That is, time to clean it up and replace those fans that are loud at startup. </s>
<s> What you find is that this is cheaper to do yourself and if you take it in you find the bill to be that of a new machine. </s>
<s> So here's my question. </s>
<s> Why not fix the machine? </s>
<s> Sure, I'd love to, but I'm no expertise in computer hardware by any means... </s>
<s> So any help from anyone would be appreciated... </s>
<s> Watch http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html But I can't offer a tutorial on replacing fans. </s>
<s> Minor skills such as what was needed in the above video and finding the fans at newegg.com or geeks.com is all you need. </s>
<s> Beware taking it to the service counter since you don't want to know the usual fees. </s>

<s> Is there any troubleshooting I can run to narrow the problem possibility down to the fan? </s>
<s> When you perform the cleanup as you see in the video once it's cleaned up you can leave the cover off, power up and find the dead or humming fan. </s>
<s> That's the one to replace. </s>
<s> Not everyone wants to work on their own hardware. </s>
<s> If not you have a choice of a service counter or a new machine. </s>
