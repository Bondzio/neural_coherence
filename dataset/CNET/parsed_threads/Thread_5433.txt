<s> I recently bought Myst Uru: Complete Chronicles (I already have Myst,II, & III and was able to play them with no problem.). </s>
<s> I have had difficulty getting the game to work and when I visited the forum I gathered that my graphics card just wasn't up to the task. </s>
<s> The one I have is pretty old, so I guess I'm not that surprised. </s>
<s> I don't have a lot of money but I'm hoping to get some good advice here. </s>
<s> I'm particularly concerned because my motherboard is also old and I don't know what kind of cards will be able to be installed on it. </s>
<s> Intel has stopped giving any advice about it. </s>
<s> I have and Intel D845WN motherboard with an Intel Pentium 4 processor, speed 1.6 ghz. </s>
<s> My current graphics card is an Ati Rage 128pro Xpert 2000pro 32m AGP (I copied this right off the card) and is the card the thing came with so I don't know if there is a certain number of connectors that I need to worry about or anything like that. </s>
<s> I do have 512mb of RAM and am running Windows XP Pro, SP2 as my OS. </s>
<s> then as to the graphics card...make sure your powersupply can handle. </s>
<s> an ati 1300pro should take care of all the games you play and will be a big improvement over the card u are using now. </s>
<s> well then u can wait for the x1300 to come out in agp but i think it will take a while. </s>
<s> instead, i would just suggest a nvidia card instead sine most previous ati card dont perform well and not worth the price. </s>
<s> suggest getting a 6600gt agp version instead. </s>
<s> check at newegg.com for your choice </s>
<s> I have a friend who had a spare (read old) NVidia GeForce card and I was able to replace my old (even older) card much easier than I expected to. </s>
<s> Thanks for your replies! </s>
