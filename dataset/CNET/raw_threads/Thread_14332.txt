13950	0	139776	1569930	NR	vprguy88	11/29/05 1:19 PM	1.13327034E12	Is my PSU sufficient	So I just got a new computer and It is working nicely and everything. I just bought a video card to add to it. It is a ATI Radeon X700 Pro, 256 MB, PCIe x 16 video card. My friend is telling me that I should buy a new Power Supply Unit because mine is probably not going to be good enough and it can blow. Is this true? My Current PSU Specs ( I just copied it from the sticker on the PSU) Model: ATX-300-122 INPUT: 100-127v-7A , 200-240v-4A , 60/50 Hz OUTPUT: +12 V Computer Specs OP: XP Home Edition Processor: AMD Athlon 64 (2 GHz) +3200 RAM: 1 GB DDR Hard drive: 200 GB And New Video Card: Radeon x700 PRO 256 MB PCIe So should I buy a new PSU or should I stick with the one I have? Thank you soo much for the help.

I used an economy 680 Watt PSU. http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:BJhvUQRxVA4J:technologyvault.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,31/prev_next,next.html+ATX-300-122&hl=en notes your supply and it might be abouy 440 Watt, but I'd be guessing. It might be fine. Bob
