while we have many hp printers at the office at home i used the hp k550 until it's heads gave out.
another moderator gave a nod to the canon mx870 and what a beast.
the really good thing about it is their software really works nicely with windows 7 64 bit where the new hp all-in-ones failed to connect.
i was surprised that hp had missed but with a recent hp laptop support failure i think hp has lost me.
