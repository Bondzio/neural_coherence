Things you can do/try: - Copy the existing pictures off to your hard disk, delete them on the USB-stick, chkdsk it, then make some subfolders and copy the files back to them.
Try to keep each subfolder less than 5000 pictures.
- Don't save from your browser to the jump drive.
First save to a temp folder on your hard disk.
Then copy to the jump drive using your favorite file manager (like Windows Explorer) Probably one of these alternatives is enough to solve your issue.
But it won't harm at all to do both.
