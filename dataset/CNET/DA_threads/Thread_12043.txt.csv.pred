1.1.1	i dont know if anyone has run into this problem but i was trying to install my new 200gig hd ,in windows xp, and it wouldnt install it with the install software cd or any possible way and then all of a sudden it started clicking and it shows on another computer that the drive is locked, is there any way to unlock it?	St
1.1.2	i want to use the drive as a second one on my computer but im afraid that i might have a new paper weight, any help would be appreciated	St
1.2.1	XP doesn't support such (until SP1) as well as other OSes.	St
1.2.2	More at http://www.48bitlba.com/ Bob	St
1.3.1	well i have xp updated to all the latest that i can get ahold of through their website, so it has sp2 installed and i thought that would fix the problem but im still clueless, thanks for all your help though, its greatly appreciated	St
1.4.1	It's some utility on the drive maker's site for you to see if its connected proper.	St
1.4.2	Some allow you to wipe the drive in preparation to partition/format with the Disk Management tool in XP.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	will this help me unlock the drive though?	St
1.5.2	cause when i put the drive in another computer it said the drive was locked	St
1.6.1	Some look for the magic bullet.	St
1.6.2	All out today.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	What install software cd were you using?	St
1.7.2	You shouldn't have to be using anything on that drive if you plan to use it as a second harddrive (slave) with XP except to hook it up as a slave and then format it when you get to the desktop.	St
1.7.3	If you were trying to install XP on it when you already have XP on the system as the boot, then that may be where you ran into trouble.	St
1.7.4	You don't mention what position you hooked that drive up as on the second machine (master/slave?	St
1.7.5	)....nor do you say if you hooked it up as a slave what the actual boot drive on that machine is.	St
1.7.6	TONI	St
1.8.1	sorry, i have it hooked up as the slave drive on the main computer and it was hooked up as a slave on the other computer as well, i am trying to hook it up to be a second drive, i tried the install cd from maxtor that come with the harddrive, thanks for you help	St
1.9.1	There is a possibility that one or more area/s in this harddrive is damaged.	St
1.9.2	If the warranty has been expired then I problaly would try to bypass the bad area with partition magic (but you don't want to buy PM just for that though).	St
1.9.3	I just say that's what I would do.	St
1.10.1	may have put ezdrive/ezbios on the drive when it wasn't needed.	St
1.10.2	Use the bootdisk that came with the harddrive, switch to the second/slave drive on the screen, and proceed to uninstall that program (you used to have to choose ezdrive/ezbios as if you were going to install the program before you saw the uninstall feature...not sure if that's how it is now).	St
1.10.3	Once you have that program uninstalled, remove the floppy disk, reboot the computer and get to the desktop from your Master drive.	St
1.10.4	Once there, open My Computer, right click the slave drive letter that shows up, and choose FORMAT from the menu choices.	St
1.10.5	That will format the drive for NTFS and get it ready for data.	St
1.10.6	TONI	St
1.11.1	thanks but it wont even install from the original cd that came with it, it just locks up and i have to restart, i took the drive back out of the computer and know when i try to do anything it just kinda locks up for ten minutes or until i get pissed and restart even open my computer, it was brand new when i bought it,	St
1.12.1	and looked at their FAQ's, or email them and ask about &quot;Locked&quot;.	St
1.12.2	Maybe search for drive locked in these forums.	St
1.12.3	I noted such posts a number of times.	St
1.12.4	Still confused why you were putting SP 2 on the slave drive.	St
1.12.5	You only need the operating system on the boot drive.	St
1.12.6	Don't worry about paperweight.	St
1.12.7	As Art says they are warranteed and the major drive mfr's honor it with no questions asked.	St
1.12.8	They may ask a question or two to see if they can get you to unlock it.	St
1.12.9	If not they give you an RMA and reasonably quick turnaround.	St
1.13.1	no i have sp installed on the master drive not the slave one, sorry bout the confusion, ive tried looking at the maxtor site but to no solution, i will just dig deeper there and on these forums	St
1.14.1	You #1 make a 98SE boot floppy ( search for bootdisk.org-com something like that),#2 browse / download ZAP from http://www.isgsp.net/files/ibm-wipe-zap.zip (cut and paste),#3 unzip to a floppy,#4 install the kaput HD as the Primary master-cable select, no other drives connected ex the floppy,#5 boot with the 98SE floppy, #6 insert the ZAP floppy, type zap at the A: command prompt and it will give the option to wipe the first (128 sectors-I think) portion of the drive to original state-unformatted and everything-not even a boot record, #7 then move drives back into proper position, (new drive as slave) boot up XP and chances are good it will show up in drive management as good-but unformatted...	St
1.15.1	an RMA???	St
1.15.2	Theyt'll ask you to run a diagnostic that you can download.	St
1.15.3	it won't run and then you get to return the drive and get it replaced.	St
1.15.4	The replacement may be yours repaired or someone elses repaired.	St
1.15.5	I noted that most of the &quot;drive locked&quot; threads here were related to Maxtor drives.	St
