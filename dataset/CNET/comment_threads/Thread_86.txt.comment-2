I believe this drive has a USB 2.0 interface and no power supply.
Unfortunately, your iBook only has USB 1.0 and not enough power up the USB chain to power the drive which could result in a non-mounting drive.
If there is a connection on the drive enclosure for an external power supply, that would cover that problem and the drive would mount with no problem.
I say, No Problem.
You would still be left with the slow USB 1 transfer speeds.
What is that, 12Mbs?
