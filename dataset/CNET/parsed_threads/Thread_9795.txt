<s> I am working on a computer for a friend and the port for the onboard graphics isn't sending any information to the monotor.What I would like to know is if i install a new graphics card to the pci-e slot.Would this fix the problem and if any geforce 5500 or above pci-e graphics card will work? </s>
<s> if the onboard 6100 graphics are out, the chipset (and the mobo) could be toast. </s>
<s> test with a pci-e card and be sure to test all built-in functionality (usb, sound, etc.) </s>
<s> if the mobo is bad and it's out of warranty, this biostar should drop right in. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138269 microsoft may allow you to reactivate the windows license without repurchasing. </s>
<s> Do you get any bios display at all. </s>
<s> If not, try shorting the bios &quot;clearing pins&quot; to return to defaults and reboot. </s>
<s> If needed, set the jumper to allow bios clearing. </s>
<s> If still no display, reduce system to basics and see if the system responds at all. </s>
<s> It appears you may have a blown PSU(power supply) if you open case and observe the cpu fan, what does it do? </s>
<s> The other half is a bad mtrbd. </s>
<s> or component holding down the system. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> thank you for your advice on the t6420.It turns out like you said the motherboard was bad and needs replaced.My next question is will i be able to salvage anything from the old one to use on the new one.Such as processor memory...ect or will i need to replace all of it? </s>
<s> a old VGA card in a PCI slot first. </s>
<s> You can get them for a couple of dollars at flea markets and used electronic parts stores. </s>
<s> Just something to test the motherboard and chipset. </s>
<s> The Mobo will recognize any VGA thats working. </s>
<s> In answer to your original question yes your PCI-E card should work to test this as well. </s>
<s> windows should boot with the replacement (and a few driver installs). </s>
<s> remember, call microsoft if the replacement mobo forces you to reactivate. </s>
