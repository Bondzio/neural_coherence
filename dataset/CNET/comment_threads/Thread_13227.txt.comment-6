It depends on the power supply.
Some are weak (low cost ones) even at 450W and can't supply a continuous amount to handle the additional stuff.
When a factory puts out a computer they try to match the power supply for what they have installed at the time of delivery.
So, if you start adding stuff like high end video cards and other things then that particular PS may not pass the muster.
