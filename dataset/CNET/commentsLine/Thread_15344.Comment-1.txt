i'm looking to get a new computer soon and i have a lot of files i want to move between my old and new computer (about 60+ gb worth).
i was looking into ways to do that and found out about crossover cables but then found out there's a lot of set up involved (i.e., &quot;you can't just connect two computers and expect them to share files right away.&quot;).
i'm wondering if the belkin easytransfer cable is better because it does have a plug-and-play aspect to it?
thanks in advance.
