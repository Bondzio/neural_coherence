<s> I have a strange problem with my HP Pavilion t3360. </s>
<s> In the past the screen Configuration/system/hardware/device management shows a list of devices including something like ATI PCI IDE controller. </s>
<s> But since some time (I dont know exactly when) it shows instead of ATI PCI IDE controller : Unknown device The rest of the IDE devices seems to be listed normally: Primary IDE channel Primary IDE channel Primary IDE channel Secundary IDE channel Secundary IDE channel Secundary IDE channel Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller Reloading (advice of HP-helpdesk) the ATI driver has no effect Also DriverMax and DriverGuide reports Unknown device. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> The HP uses as south bridge ATI SB450. </s>
<s> I have all the time installed XP Servicepack 2 and IE 7. </s>
<s> The desktop is absolute free of any malware. </s>
<s> The desktop works all the way as it ought to do. </s>
<s> Corneille. </s>
