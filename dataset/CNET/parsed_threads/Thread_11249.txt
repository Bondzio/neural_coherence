<s> Hi, Can anybody let us know the default username and password for the failsafe account of Summit X450e-48p Extreme Networks Switch. </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> See your other thread. </s>
<s> You don't tell anything about what support you have on this device. </s>
<s> - Isn't that in the manual? </s>
<s> - And can't the support dept of the manufacturer or the company that installed it for you tell you? </s>

<s> Nothing written in manuals about failsafe default username and password. </s>

<s> I forget the exact user id been a long time since I did this. </s>
<s> The password is a firmware thing. </s>
<s> They ask you for the serial number of the box and input into a program which generates the password. </s>
<s> It is unique for each unit. </s>
<s> Needless to say they protect that program since you could break into anyones equipment just knowing the serial number......they want to make money off it from people like you. </s>
