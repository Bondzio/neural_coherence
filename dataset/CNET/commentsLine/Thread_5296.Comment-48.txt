i would strongly reccommend that if you plan to game on this machine you are considering that you pick up an aftermarket graphics card... preferably online since box store retailers tend to overcharge for pc components.
also, 256mb may have been be a while ago, but now it's puny.
also, the fact that it's shared means it will take away that amount of memory out of your system memory... the 4gb or however much your compy comes with, so it hurts both the video and the processor perfomance.
considering getting one of the $50-$75 nvidia cards, like the geforce 8600 or something.
it'll be well worth the extra cost.
happy computing!
