<s> What is a cross-over cable ? </s>
<s> How is it different from a normal cable, e.g. </s>
<s> CAT5 or RJ45, ... and when is it used ? </s>
<s> And what are &quot;twists&quot; in the cable, and how does these twists &quot;qualify&quot; the cable ? </s>
<s> [all these with regard to connection of networking devices, e.g. </s>
<s> NIC, modem, router, etc. </s>
<s> ...] Thanks. </s>

<s> You have to envision the ports used by Ethernet. </s>
<s> Like devices, PC to PC, have the transmit pair and receive pair on the same pins on the cable. </s>
<s> Unlike devices, PC to router, have the transmit and receive on different pins. </s>
<s> A crossover cable is used for like devices. </s>
<s> PC to modem or router, or Networked printer use a standard cable. </s>
<s> Twists involve self induction and mutual induction of the apparent frequency of a digital signal. </s>
<s> More twists mean less loss on higher frequencies. </s>
<s> A simple example of apparent frequency and digital bit rate can be explained with a T-1 signal of 1.544 Mb/s. </s>
<s> The apparent frequency of an &quot;all 1's&quot; signal is 772 KHz. </s>
