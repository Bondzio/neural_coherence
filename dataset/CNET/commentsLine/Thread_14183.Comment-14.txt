i learned some light coding, which is a bit surprising even to me because i was born in 83. it wasn't anything impressive, just having my name flash on the screen and some simple math problems.
it also forced me to spell &quot;catalog&quot; because in order to play most games i had to type that.
it would have also helped if the machine didn't have a qwerty keyboard; i definitely did not understand why they put the letter in &quot;random&quot; order.
the talking whiz kid had a much easier keyboard to find the letters.
oh yeah we also had a talking whiz kid which we got about the same time as the apple iie, but it did not have nearly as many fun games as the apple.
the best game was mario bros. i played that all the time with my sister, and apparently it was a bootleg game because it was never actually released for the apple iie.
