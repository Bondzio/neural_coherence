i used ibm and wang systems at work (county of orange california) in 1986. the systems both had their own stand alone servers (if they went down there was no backup).
we got our first pc's at work in 1995. i think they were gateways.
learned how to use the internet at that time.
now in a new dept we are using dell's.
