I am up and running now and want to see if I can get any files off the old one. I lost the old hd when doing a De-frag, it stopped responding at about 39 percent. I waited for hours to see if it would finish and it didn't. I tried to cancel the de-frag, I couldn't. I had to re boot the computer and after that it wouldn't start up. I tried the repair function with the XP Pro cd and it wouldn't work. I tried to format the drive and it wouldn't work. So my question is: Should I try to make it a slave drive and see if I can retrieve any files? Is there a danger in trying to do this? Thank you for your help, Stan

A KNOPPIX CD. (Use google to find KNOPPIX) 2. PC FILE INSPECTOR. http://www.download.com/PC-Inspector-File-Recovery/3000-2248-10118664.html?tag=lst-0-1 Bob

I was wondering if I should delete the old windows folder? Since the operating system is installed on my new drive I should probably get rid of the old stuff and it won;t be needed, right? I downloaded the PC Inspector in case I need it to work on the old drive.
