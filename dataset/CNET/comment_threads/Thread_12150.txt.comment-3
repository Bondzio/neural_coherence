Hi JJPflash I don't now if you're problem has been fixed already.
I just want to share to you my own experience about the same thing that happen to my external hard drive.
A friend referred me to data recovery San Diego for help and I have my external hard drive fixed and my file recovered easily.
I just hope that by sharing this simple things can be of good help to you.
