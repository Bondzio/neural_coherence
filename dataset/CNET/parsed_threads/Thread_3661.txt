<s> I need to know the signs of a failing power supply. </s>
<s> My computer is constantly crashing and locks up, then reboots. </s>
<s> The power supply is running hot most of the time (the fan is working) It crashes and reboots the same way with Windows XP, Windows 98SE and Windows ME. </s>
<s> The RAM tested ok.(512MB DDR). </s>
<s> The HDD tested ok no errors. </s>
<s> I have 2 additional exhaust fans installed. </s>
<s> Internal system temp is 78F CPU temp is 115F. </s>
<s> I shut this computer down and borrowed another computer to use in the mean time. </s>
<s> I don't want to risk destroying the motherboard with the power supply shorting out. </s>
<s> I haven't taken it in for testing yet, but should I consider replacing the power supply anyway? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> with a known good PS. </s>
<s> If the reboots stop, you have the answer. </s>
<s> Unfortunely, a weak p/s unit causes all havoc and just makes the system flaky in general. </s>
<s> P/S problem can effect all aspects of the system, so you really can't trust anything. </s>
<s> Thus, the quickest fix is to replace/swap. </s>
<s> But, you mentioned your heat is hot, that alone can effect the p/s worthiness as it starts to falter under such conditions. </s>
<s> Leave the side cover off the system and it seems to settle down, you truly got a &quot;heat problem&quot;. </s>
<s> Further, you can place a household fan to better cool the innards and it really settles down, you found a heat problem. </s>
<s> That being the case, damage maybe already done and replacement may still be called for on the p/s or any other fan(s), plusa they have to sucking in air and exhausting it as well at a rate capable of cooling the system. </s>
<s> Air circualation is must to better help air flow through out the system case. </s>
<s> A good p/s unit should be 400W+ or better and be a quality build unit as well, so pick a namebrand if that what it comes down to. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> That is, if they are valid readings. </s>
<s> Have you checked for bulging or leaking capacitors? </s>
<s> The large ones located around the CPU. </s>
<s> What did you test the memory with? </s>
<s> For how long??? </s>
<s> Probably much cheaper to put a new supply in than pay someone to check it out. </s>
<s> Have you done the complete gamut of things to do to eliminate spyware, parasites et al??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> take the side cover off and leave it that way. </s>
<s> The case is designed to be closed for proper airflow. </s>
<s> You will get more dust inside as well. </s>
<s> Just swap out the power supply and see what happens. </s>
<s> What size is you power supply? </s>
<s> Also look for swolen or leaking capactors on the mother board. </s>
<s> Any way per A+ stuff the first thing is to replace the power supply. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> I decided to replace the power supply , the computer responded well, no problems. </s>
<s> I had the system temp sensor tested, it was ok. </s>
<s> It was just the power supply itself that was running hot and malfunctioning. </s>
<s> Everything is back to normal. </s>
<s> It is still running well. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> this was the first time I had a power supply unit fail in my own equipment. </s>
<s> This was a great lesson learned. </s>
<s> I know what to look for in the future. </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone. </s>
