<s> Hi, my desktop speakers produce a background scratch/static when the my computer is processing(?) </s>
<s> and even more noticeably when I drag the mouse pointer. </s>
<s> I have replaced the speakers so I know that is not the problem. </s>
<s> My sound source is on-board. </s>
<s> I bought a new sound card but could not find an available slot to install it. </s>
<s> Help?&lt;div style=&quot;overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> You're right to look for an alternate sound card. </s>
<s> The noise is caused by other circuitry in the pc interfering with the sensitive parts of the audio electronics. </s>
<s> So I guess you should have looked for a free slot before buying a card. </s>
<s> Can't you take it back to the store and change it for a USB one ? </s>
<s> Hello, thanks for the feedback. </s>
<s> I suppose I could have been more specific. </s>
<s> There was an available slot, but the sound card was too large(?). </s>
<s> Regardless...I did take it back and bought a USB sound card ( an item that previously i did not know existed). </s>
<s> A prior response helped me to find it. </s>
<s> Great sound now. </s>
