i like modding my case/set up.
my latest is to mount a 80 mm fan in the right side of the case--ie, the side that is next to the motherboard.
on the outside of this, one inch in from the sides, i mounted a spacer 3/4 inch thick and on top of that i placed an air filter.
the fan fits through a hole and faces the internal racks for the harddrives so now i have clean filtered air blowing directly on these units==they are cool to the touch.
the fan also lights up the case which i view thru the clear panel on the left side of the puter.
(all parts scavenged except filter for total cost of $3) i ran for years without the sides mounted on the case until a dropped pen bounced into the case--nothing happened, but i was warned.
