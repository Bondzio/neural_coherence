processor ( [939-pin] amd athlon-64 x2 3800+ cpu w/ hyper transport technology ) motherboard ( asus a8n-e nvidia nforce4-ultra chipset w/7.1 sound, gb lan, s-ata raid, usb 2.0 pci-e motherboard ) memory ( 2048 mb [1024mb x2] ddr-400 pc3200 memory module corsair-value or major brand ) video card ( [pci-express 16x] nvidia geforce 6800xt 256mb w/dvi + tv out video ) 400w power supply silver running windows xp.
it will allow me to choose safe mode but it still shuts down at the same point.
i have tried all the selections it offers and none make it past the windows cover screen.
as soon as the cover screen goes off the pc restars.
