hey all, i'm in the process of upgrading my dell pc and i have a couple questions about compatability.
i had hoped to buy asus's new sli capable motherboard to run two nvidia 6800 oc pci express cards.
i also have an upgraded power supply.
what else to i need to purchase in order to get my system up and running?
thanks, m. walsh
