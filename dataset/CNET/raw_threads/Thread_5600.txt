How can I tell which is a 233 and which is a 650? doesn't say anywhere. just a long string of numbers. also, if I put a 650 PII in a mobo that will only go up to 450 on a PII (550 on a PIII), what will happen? thanks - fj

If you set the jumper incorrectly (speed set too high), then the cpu just won't work; no damage done. Of course if you set the speed lower then the actual, then it will work at that lower speed.

Too bad you didn't supply at least two of those so we could have tried it and showed how we determined what was what. Bob PS. It's Intel.com...
