1.1.1	I looking for a new video card capable of playing NWN2 and other newer games.	St
1.1.2	I'm not looking for a card with minimum specs but I'm not in the market of spending over $350 either.	St
1.1.3	Current PC specs: Area-51 PC, XP Home SP2, D945GNTLR MB, P4 3.4 GHZ CPU, 1 gig RAM, ATI Radeon X550 256MB graphics card.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	all prices for my suggestions are based on web shops like newegg.com or zipzoomfly.com.	St
1.3.2	all cards have 256mb.	St
1.3.3	the x1650pro and 7600gt can probably get by with a 350w power supply but the others will need 400w.	St
1.3.4	the x1900gt is a very good performer for $140.	St
1.3.5	it would be my top recommendation as it faster than a 7600gt but it is very long, runs somewhat hot, and needs a well ventilated case.	St
