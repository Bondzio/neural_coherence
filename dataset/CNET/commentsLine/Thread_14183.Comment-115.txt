in 1979, i bought one of the first atari 800 computers.
the serial number was 0000258, and was handwritten on a sticker inside the machine.
i still have it, along with the atari falcon that i bought later.
the falcon was the first computer to have a true 1-mb of ram.
i still have the falcon, as well.
