Let me first say that I'm not really a gamer, or know too much about what I have....but I do know that it isn't too shabby. My friend was selling his older Alienware (I think it's a 2000 and I think the color is Martian Red) for only $200, and I may not know much, but I do know that is a hell of a deal....since it ran doom3 and half life flawlessly with all the settings maxed. The 2nd best card on the market at the time was installed, a Radeon 700 something, and there is an audigy sound card on the front, and I think my friend upgraded the hard drive to 200 gigs...not sure if that is stock though. He may have done more to it, but I'm not sure. First, I've had for over a year and it has just been sitting under my desk not working. What I think happened was one of the fans stopped working, since it got really hot right before it stopped....which I was told is ok...but I don't see how it is now I think about it. It basically starts to boot, then gets to a blue screen...which i imagine is the desktop color but I don't remember now...and then restarts again in a continous loop. I've been told by a couple people that it is the power core, or center, or something and that it's a cheap fix....like $30. You would think with a piece of technology so advanced, that if a fan quit...it wouldn't ruin the whole thing, and something inexpensive would break to save your comp....If not, what could this be and how do I fix it? Secondly, how do I check what year it is and what the specs are? (what are the specs on an '00 anyway?) Finally, what can I get for it when I sell it? I thank you all for being kind and helping me. If you all have any guitar related questions....I'm all ears Jeff Daughtridge

You can get new COMPLETE SYSTEMS for about $250-$300 these days. A nonfunctioning fan can mean many things, incluting a bad motherboard, PSU, or it could be just a broken fan. If the CPU or PSU fan doesn't work, that is a MAJOR PROBLEM. Can't tell without testing. No one can tell you anthing about what you could get for it if yo don't give detailed specs. The following free utilities will help you get hardware specs. Also tell us the OS. Belarc Advisor Everest Home Edition PC Wizard CPU-Z SANDRA Lite Aside: Any Windows computer without the Windows XP installation CD and valid Product Key is completely useless in the long run...unless you make it a Linux machine.

The radeon card was worth i think he said like $400-$500 new, and the audigy card is im gonna guess worth at least $100. The comp worked for about 2 weeks while i owned it; worked great too. The fan was on the sliding door that went out. Also, I THINK that it is a 2000, b/c it isnt shaped like the ones of today....I wish i knew more on the subject really.

CPU (CPU-Z) motherboard (system board) model number (CPU-Z) Memory (RAM) amount and type (CPU-Z) Hard drive(s) CD/DVD drive Video card model Which Audigy soundcard (there are many) Look on the back of the computer for Power Supply Unit maximum Wattage and manufacturer (model number if there). Does this include keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor? What monitor? What speakers?

Take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard. It will be something like ASUS A7N8X. Next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans. Are they all spinning? Are they clear? Not all clogged up with dust? The main fans to look at are the CPU fan & the Power Supply Fan. Note everything & give us as many details as possible.
