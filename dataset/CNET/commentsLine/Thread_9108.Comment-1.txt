i have a very frustrating problem with this monitor.
sometimes it works fine for days, then suddenly goes black, and stays that way for days then i switch it on randomly, and up it comes again.
when it goes black, and i switch it off and on again, it lights up perfectly for a fraction of a second before going black again.
i can repeat this as many times as i want then some day itll come right again.
i fix pcs for a living, so understand technology in general, but have never worked on screens anybody give me any pointers?
any help on how to physically strip it down would be helpful too, as i tend to break little plastic catches and things thanks a lot roger
