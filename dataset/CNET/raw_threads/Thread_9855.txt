5085	4	290835	2748216	2747882	gigitygigitygigity	4/9/08 8:40 PM	1.2077736E12	ok...	my situation is that if i boot on any hard drive with an nvidia driver, something in my motherboard will not boot. if u look at this picture, http://www.winsupersite.com/images/showcase/winvista_install_clean_002.jpg you will notice this is my so called loading bar. when it scrolls across 3 or 4 times with an nvidia driver, it will get stuck ad hand the boot process. Ntune, an overclocking utility, has a fan speed controll ive always liked. the 8800 GTX, i said gts on accident earlier, but it has a wierd fan speed glitch and needs to be sped up by ntune or riva tuner. if u play crysis at 1920x1200 medium settings and very high textures like me, that would chew up an 8800 gtx after 2 hours, it will get up to 87-90C at 60% fan speed and itl stay at 70ish with 100% for me. i also play CoD4 and unreal tournament 3 1920x1200 max settings with 60 capped fps never changing. basicly anyway i need a way to uninstall ntune on my other hard drive so i can boot successfully every time.
5085	5	290835	2748400	2748216	Willy	4/10/08 6:46 AM	1.20780996E12	I suggest	If you can't find a &quot;de-installer&quot; routine that it provides(check support website), then see if one is at the add/remove icon in the control panel. If not there, then see if using latest CCleaner(tools section) which provides an un-installer feature for pgms.. Other add/remove pgms may help also provided the Ntune hasn't corrupted itself to un-install. Under the start-up segment: type, msconfig, uncheck Ntune, reboot and then try un-installing as most running pgms. won't un-install if they are active. Since, much of Ntune is done prior to final boot-up, yeah I can see the glitch plus it also is &quot;auto-detecting&quot; feature doesn't need your input as it gets underway. Of course, be sure you have set a restore point before any of the above to help recover if gets hosed or back-up registry. You can try reloading Ntune and get it done, then try the above to see it now unloads. Check also in your install CD if it provides the un-install pgm. for Ntune or menu offering that(maybe). You can also get the boot-up menu. Hit &lt;F8&gt; during boot-up and see if using the &quot;line by line&quot; start-up procedure helps determine other causes as well. To get to see as line items are started just what is any seems to cause an issue. Just another lookee at the problem. tada -----Willy
