i will be buying a desktop at some point in the next few months, and am seeing a lot of low- and middle-range desktops are now sporting ddr3 ram.
i am wondering how it compares to ddr2.
i asked in another forum, and was told that the performance difference between the two is not that great.
i find this hard to believe, but have no way of knowing for sure.
what do people here think?
