Microsoft has not produced patches to IE 5.0 so it's very possible that parasites or more are having a party.
This upsets some people, but I am not the one to take it out on.
The parasite scans are noted at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 You'll have to ask Microsoft if the holes will be patched any day soon.
