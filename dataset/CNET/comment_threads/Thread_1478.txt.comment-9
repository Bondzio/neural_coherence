Yeah maybe the 2 gb would be alot for right now, but in the future for more demanding tasks, 2 gbs should be fine.
Now I am not sure but I believe 4 512 mb memory stick equals to 2gb??
is this correct, so in my opinion you should get 1 stick of 1 gb of memory so that you can get the max of 4gb in your motherboard.
About the hard drives, it depends on what you want.
I saw a great deal on tigerdirect.com on 300 gb harddrive for $90, that would be perfect for your budget.
Of course get a better GPU if you can.
I only suggested the 6800 because it is a cheap and a capable GPU, and I believe the 6800gt blocks an expansion slot (or is that the AGP version, don't know).
If you can get the 6800gt or even the 7800gt, you are good to go.
