i'm having the same problem, except i don't use sleep mode, it's just when i boot it up.
i've found out a few things about it: one, if i reseat everything it stops having the issue, but that's temporary and it will soon start doing it again more frequently, and two, when i kick it right after i boot it it has a better chance of starting up, but i really don't like doing that because it's potentially harmful to the hardware.
even so, this tells me something is seated incorrectly or loosely, but if that's the case i can't figure out what it is because i've gone through every connection on the board, a few times each, and they all seem to be fine.
i can't send it to be repaired because it's a custom, but right now i'm pretty stumped and i can't find any help, and this is the first thread i've come across which has the problem i'm having.
please, if anyone knows how to fix this, share.
thank you.
