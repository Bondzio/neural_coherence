my old pc (of which i donated to a charitable organization) was an ibm with windows 2000 professional and my visioneer 8700 scanner worked well.
with my new dell 4700, the software is not compatible with xp.
i checked a couple of sites and they concur that visioneer does not keep pace with operating system upgrades even though it claims it is certified with xp sp2 (maybe older versions).
does anyone have any suggestions (other than buying a new scanner) as far as obtaining drivers that are compatible with xp sp2?
i have my eye on a canon lide35 - any comments?
