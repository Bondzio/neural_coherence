1.1.1	My friend as the following Printer Epson Stylus 300.The problem is it will not take one sheet of paper at a time.If she puts 6 sheets in it will take all 6.How does she get it to take just one sheet.Running Windows 98.Thanks for any help.BOB.	St
1.2.1	Just to rule out a certain software issue, perform the printer self test and if it picks up 6 sheets, then the printer has a failure.	St
1.2.2	If you can't vacuum the dust and paper bits out (you didn't reveal if the simple cleaning was done) and use some alcohol soaked paper towel to clean off the rubber rollers, then you may find repair costs exceed new printer costs.	St
1.2.3	In closing, if the printer is over 2 years old, go shopping.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
