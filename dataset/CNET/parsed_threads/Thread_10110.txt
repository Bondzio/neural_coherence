<s> I play world of warcraft, and I have a great custom built computer that well exceeds the recommended specs for the game. </s>
<s> Up until about 2 weeks ago, I have had a flawless connection and can't even remember disconnecting once while raiding, and now I can't even raid with my guild without it lagging and then disconnecting every 2-5 minutes. </s>
<s> It will lag for a second, then sometimes recover, but most of the time it disconnects, but i stay connected to ventrilo, or aim w.e it may be. </s>
<s> And I can reconnect usually immediately after. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I run a wireless connection, with a netgear router. </s>
<s> Computer specs: (cpu - AMD athlon 64 x2 dual core 4400+, Asus A8N SLI Deluxe motherboard socket 939, 2 gigs crucial DDR1 RAM, 250 gig Maxtor hardrive w/ 25% space used, and last but not least most importantly nvidia geforce 8800 GTS, 320 MB video RAM, I believe 500 and change processing speed, and 94 pipelines on the vid card. </s>
<s> Also running WinXP professional) We think it's our cable modem itself, so we ordered a new one from our ISP. </s>
<s> It will arrive in about 4-5 days. </s>
<s> Also when I play any other games, which is mainly counterstrike source, It almost never happens. </s>
<s> It mostly happens on world of warcraft when intense stuff is goin on. </s>
<s> But like i said before, it never once used to do that up until 2 weeks ago, even while running the absolute maximum video settings and running several high end addons (mods). </s>
<s> It was absolutely flawless. </s>
<s> I also ran every single sweep possible on my computer, spyware, virus, cleared registry keys, defragged, cookies, and internet files (offline content). </s>
<s> Made sure to download the latest video card driver. </s>
<s> But that's the only driver I updated. </s>
<s> A friend suggested a new driver (firmware) for my router, but i haven't done that quite yet. </s>
<s> So any help would be much muchhh appreciated, please reply with support, thank you. </s>
