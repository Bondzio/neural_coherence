1.1.6	so the remaining amount is the above number.	St
1.1.7	if someone could help me out that would be great.	St
1.1.8	thanks.	St
1.2.1	You don't state what you are running now or what you would like the upgraded system to be able to handle.	St
1.2.2	For example, do you play a lot of games, do photo editing, or just want a basic system for surfing the net and home office uses?	St
1.2.3	If you upgrade the motherboard, cpu, case, ram and power supply, how is that not a new system or darn near it?	St
1.2.4	For example, you could look on Extremetech's $800 build it yourself gaming system and then pick which parts to upgrade to fit your budget and wants.	St
1.2.5	Regards, JB	St
