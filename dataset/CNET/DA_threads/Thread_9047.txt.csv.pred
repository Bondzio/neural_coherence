1.1.1	Need some help.	St
1.1.2	Have a 4 month old AlienWare X51, been running great until yesterday, it says it has no internet access.	St
1.1.3	The signal is there and its connected to the router, I have full bars.	St
1.1.4	But its saying theres no internet access.	St
1.1.5	My laptop, TV, iPhone, and Xbox are all working, no problems what so ever on the same network.	St
1.1.6	Any help would be greatly appreciated!	St
1.2.1	Geeez, I really don't mean to be flippant but I saw Alienware with an issue and could NOT help but have a little chuckle.	St
1.2.2	Don't get me wrong, Alienware makes some pretty neat stuff.	St
1.2.3	I would assume you have already checked out your network settings, etc.	St
1.2.4	, firewall, security settings and listed homepage to see that it hasn't changed.	St
1.2.5	Since all your other hook ups work I am suspicious as to the possibility of your system having picked up a bug of some kind.	St
1.2.6	You didn't mention any error messages re hdwe issues.	Polite
1.2.7	Of course you have likely looked in device manager to see if there might be an issue with the net adapter.	St
