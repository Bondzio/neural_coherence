I have an HP Compaq dv7100 Small Form Factor Desktop that I want to upgrade the Processor in.
It is an HP 097Ch Motherboard with and Intel i915G Chipset and an LGA 775 Processor Socket.
It currently has a Prescott Pentium 4 HT 530 3.0Ghz Processor and I am wondering if there is a processor upgrade for this older Desktop that would be worth it.
I know the LGA 775 was used all the way up to the Core 2 Extreme quad-cores, but I would imagine this machine would only be capable of maybe a Pentium D. On the HP website it only shows Pentium 4 and Celeron processors but I do believe that is just what they were sold with
