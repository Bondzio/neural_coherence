<s> Just bought an eMachines T6212 w/PCI-Express and IGP. </s>
<s> Haven't bought a computer in 2 years and even now my 4600ti runs the latest game I bought, Call of Duty, really well... </s>
<s> But my dad wants my computer so I bought a new one. </s>
<s> Which do you think is better? </s>
<s> I've heard good things about the 6600GT and not really anything about the x700. </s>
<s> I found the ATI for $149 at newegg.com vs. $179 for the Nvidia. </s>
<s> Is the Nvidia worth $30 more? </s>
<s> Any other cards I should consider? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> i was wondering if the t6212 had a ultra ata/dma hard drive or a sata hard drive? </s>
<s> http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20041222/index.html the X700Pro isn't comparable to the 6600GT the X700XT is comparable to the 6600GT the X700Pro slots in between the 6600nU and the 6600GT the X600XT is comparable to the 6600nU the X600Pro is slightly slower but read that benchmarking article decide which you like </s>
<s> I believe... </s>
<s> In that case, 6600gt is definitely the better deal... </s>
<s> Yes its great!!! </s>

<s> I hope so! </s>
<s> Monarch Computers is building me a system with dual 6600GTs using SLI technology. </s>
<s> It's already shipped...can't wait! </s>
<s> i would have gotten 2 eVGA 6800GTS. </s>

<s> This is a link with a new comparison of video cards and benchmarks as relates to World of Warcraft (circa March 23rd, 2005). </s>
<s> This is newer than the Tom's Hardware review and also compares the new ATI 850 chipset. </s>

<s> Hey, I am wondering if you can put a 6600gt or x700pro in a T6212 with factory psu? </s>
<s> It's 300w right? </s>
<s> I think I read 6600gt requires 350w minimum. </s>
<s> The x700pro, not as good maybe but I think it only requires 300w. </s>
<s> But I am still not sure. </s>
<s> It seems to be hard to find the correct specs for all these components. </s>
<s> If anyone has either of these installed in their factory T6212 please respond and tell me what you have and how well it works. </s>
<s> Otherwise if you have either of these and have made modifications to the psu then I would like to hear about your machine too :P Thanks, SeaninWa </s>
<s> If I could have afforded it yeah...so would I. </s>
