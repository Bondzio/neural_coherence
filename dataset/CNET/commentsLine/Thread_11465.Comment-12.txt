wep is no protection today.
that is, in less than 120 seconds with kid friendly software other folk can hijack your connection and use your internet connection as they wish.
but in this discussion it looks like you are stuck with it.
when you can, and when the machines allow it, move off wep asap.
and let's be clear.
mac address filtering does not work and hiding the ssid only results in more complaints and no added security.
--&gt; use what works but be aware of the downsides.
