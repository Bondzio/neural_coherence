1.1.1	Does it matter how much unused space there is on the recovery partition?	St
1.1.2	I don't see where it would matter but would like a second opinion.	St
1.1.3	I made the recovery partition on the new hdd about 600Mb smaller of unused space then the orginal.	St
1.1.4	So now it has 517Mb of unused space vs about 1.2Gb	St
1.2.1	The whole idea of a recovery partition is to hold the required info needed upon the dreaded later date.	St
1.2.2	If you're using recovery CDs and/or OS from the OEM vendor, it should automatically make it back to the day it was made at least big name vendors.	St
1.2.3	Just follow the prompts or guide for a true mirror image of what was on that 1st day.	Sug
1.2.4	Also, I'm sure there's a finite space required, so reducing it too small isn't going to help maybe hinder the process.	St
1.2.5	If this all to just gain more space, is the 600mb worth that much trouble, maybe better to get a larger HD if possible.	St
1.2.6	enjoy -----Willy	Polite
1.3.1	I worded that poorly.	St
1.3.2	I replaced the hdd in an hp pavilion 304w and created a system and recovery partition on the new hdd.	St
1.3.3	I then cloned the old partitions from the old hdd to the new.	St
1.3.4	There was about 1.2Gb of unused space left on the recovery partition of the old hdd.	St
1.3.5	So I couldn't understand why the company left such a large amount of unused wasted space.	St
1.3.6	On the new hdd I left only 512Mb of unused space on the recovery partition after cloning of the recovery system.	St
1.3.7	As far as I know the recovery partition isn't wrote to during the recovery process.	St
1.3.8	It only copies the recovery back to the system partition.	St
1.3.9	So I wasn't completely sure that the recovery partition isn't written back to during the recovery process.	St
1.3.10	If it is then maybe I need to make that unused space a little bigger.	St
