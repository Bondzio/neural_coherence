the problem is the cd/dvd drives.
i can't use them and after a chkdsk test run by dell on call and before that a whole nite with the hardware warranty folks, plus the installation of two new cd/dvd drives yesterday, it was determined by those people at dell that there are currupt files in windows and the only solution is to reinstall the os which for this computer is win xp he.
i don't have any other real problem, at least none that i know of.
i'm not trying to be cute or unable to face the real problem.
this is all i know about my problem.
i have listed the specs about my computer in my profile, but here they are again: system manufacturer
