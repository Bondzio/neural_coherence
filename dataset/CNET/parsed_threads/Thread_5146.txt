<s> I'm buying my next desktop. </s>
<s> Is there an advantage to having both a DVD +/-RW and a CD/RW? </s>
<s> Or will I be happy with just one drive that does it all... My instinct is just to get only the DVD +/-RW, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> For having two consider. </s>
<s> Speed of transfer during copies. </s>
<s> Wear and tear on a single drive. </s>
<s> redundancy if a failure ocurrs. </s>
<s> Speeds offered for pure reads on one versus the other. </s>
<s> I now have a dual setup. </s>
<s> A DVROM and an all format 4X DVD+/-RW. </s>
<s> I like it. </s>
<s> Next time, since prices have crashed on DVD recorders, I'll just get 2 of the same in the machine. </s>
<s> Last night's midnight madness sale has 8X Optowrites for about 49 bucks. </s>
<s> Go figure where this madness ends? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob's answer is the most workable solution nowdays. </s>
<s> A DVD-Rom will play EITHER DVDs or CDs. </s>
<s> A DVD-RW will burn EITHER DVDs or CDS. </s>
<s> By the way, Bob, I have been happy with the BTC (badged as Emprex) 8x multi-format I got for $70 at Fry's. </s>
<s> Not the fastest out, but I'm not so busy I can't wait 20 more seconds. </s>
<s> I am curious why DVD media prices haven't really come down. </s>
<s> Unless I'm missing something, they cost the same(pennies) to manufacture as CDs. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Try the last 50 packs of DVD-R or DVD+R I picked out at a midnight madness sale. </s>
<s> Try $11.75 for 50. </s>
<s> While it can't beat Officemax's 200 CD pack they offered for Zero bucks after rebate which you still paid tax and mailing fees so that was about 4 bucks, I can see that per GigaByte, the prices are on par with CDR. </s>

<s> &quot;I am curious why DVD media prices haven't really come down. </s>
<s> Unless I'm missing something, they cost the same(pennies) to manufacture as CDs.&quot; It would be if the volumes were the same as CD's, which they haven't quite matched yet. </s>
<s> In fact Sam's Club is dropping blank DVD's or so I was told when shopping locally for them. </s>
<s> Even though the technology is similar for manufacturing, it is different enough that if the volume isn't there the price stays higher. </s>
<s> And of course there is &quot;what the market will bear&quot;. </s>
<s> think about getting a dual layer burner. </s>
<s> I think they burn like 8.5GB or so. </s>
<s> Might be a bit costly at first. </s>
