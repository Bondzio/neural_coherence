<s> I have been running a wireless home network for months, then decided to reinstall the Netgear WG311T adapter in one windows XP Home machine, because it disconnected a couple of times. </s>
<s> However, when attempting to run setup from the CD, I get an error message: ''Failed to load the windows 2000 setup program. </s>
<s> Please make sure that inst2000.dll is in the setup directory. </s>
<s> Error Number: 0x80040702 Description: Failed to load dll: Inst.2000 Setup will now terminate.'' </s>
<s> I am unable to get past this stage or correct it. </s>
<s> Has anyone had an experience of this, please. </s>
<s> I am assuming that I will not have to physically remove the card from the board and start from scratch? </s>
<s> I am reminded of the old adage, ''If it ain't broke, dont fix it!'' </s>
<s> Oh, and the other two machines and the broadband modem/router are all working perfectly. </s>
<s> may be related to SP1 issues as noted here: http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101299.asp and your installation problem could be the order in which you install the software and then the adapter. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Please dont ask me how I managed it, but with a combination of the XP service, Wireless Zero Configuration, and manually entering my IP address and DNS address etc. </s>
<s> in the adapter connection TCP/IP properties fields, I am accessing the net through my wireless modem/router, and all seems well. </s>
<s> Now I am reluctant to shut down this desktop, for fear of losing the settings when rebooting, which happened twice before. </s>
<s> So, how would you lock in this combination of hardware and firmware configuration, so that it will be retained next time I start up, please? </s>
