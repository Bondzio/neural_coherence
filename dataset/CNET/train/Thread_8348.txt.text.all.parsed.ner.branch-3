(i was thinking 600 or 700). 3. and the biggie: is velocity micro worth the extra money over dell or gateway? 4. is a higher hard drive and memory speed worth the extra money? 5. i have a great surround sound system(onkyo 7.1) and planned on running my audio through that. is a sound blaster card worth the extra money over the onboard sound?? here are the things i want to have: -250-500 gb hd (may get one 250 and upgrade to a second later) -e6600 or q6600 -at least 2 gb's memory -a mainstream/performance graphics card -about a 700watt ps -dual optical drives -dual tv tuner card -media reader -firewire ports, and of course usb ports any and all reviews/opinions/advice would be great! thanks in advance to all who answer.

(i was thinking 600 or 700). 3. and the biggie: is velocity micro worth the extra money over dell or gateway? 4. is a higher hard drive and memory speed worth the extra money? 5. i have a great surround sound system(onkyo 7.1) and planned on running my audio through that. is a sound blaster card worth the extra money over the onboard sound?? \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ my answers... 1. visit the intel or amd support websites for details on anything cpu 2. 500w is common now but you must get a stable version as labeling can be misleading. the stable output depends greatly on the quality of the psu. 3. velocity micro is a indepenant vendor that uses common off-shelf componets like everyone else but supposely places alot of emphesis on quality and gamer style readniess or top end systems and that costs. 4. if you're into audio&video demands, more hd space is a must. added memory is always a good bet. as for ram speed then all must be of the same class, thus capable of using its speed to its advantage. however, going from a slow speed to higher speed ram may not be evident but never-the-less is there as an overall benefit to the system. 5. most on-board sound/audio offfering are simple or limited. they do get better but there's no upgrade other than replacing with an audio card. so yes, getting creative audio over on-board audio is worth it. however, you should try using on-board as is and see if it suits your needs anyways before an upgrade. tada -----willy

1893	8	212350	2284288	2283787	zeppo	10/20/06 4:14 pm	1.16136084e12	i agree - buy a velocity micro computer!	i, too, have a velocity micro system (  ), and am very happy with it. vm does use quality components and their tech support is great. they use regular commercial motherboards, usually asus, one of the best manufacturers. dell, as with any large mass computer vendor (ie - hp, gateway) is more concerned with cutting corners to save wherever possible. almost all the components are cheaper, lower quality. and with dell, if you configure a quality system at their web site, you pay a quality price, close to or more than the cost of a velocity micro! i own a couple dell desktops that i have had to replace the cd-rom drives (one in each machine) with higher quality ones. the replaced drives would not work reliably, many times failing to open to give up cds or to accept them. this was very annoying! sony, on the other hand, is the only mass computer vendor i would recommend. i own a sony laptop that works very well. not so with our gateway or hp laptops. for a quality computer though, velocity micro is my first choice. now i know a velocity micro is a bit more expensive than the mass computer makers but worth it when it comes to reliability and upgradeability. those with money to burn might want to take a look at another quality computer builder, falcon northwest computer -
