<s> Computer is running Windows ME. </s>
<s> Connected to a Netgear router along with five other computers. </s>
<s> Never had any problems, then the other day couldn't access internet. </s>
<s> I don't know if someone screwed around with the computer or if there is an Explorer corrupt file but the problem has been troubleshooted to this: - using winipcfg, the IP address is a # which it shouldn't be and I don't know how to change it. </s>
<s> It should be something like 192.168.0.4 but its not. </s>
<s> I am home now and don't have the actual address. </s>
<s> I tried releasing the address but when I press the button nothing happens. </s>
<s> I have no idea how the IP address changed but because of this, there is no communication with the router and thus no internet. </s>
<s> Some things I tried besides releasing the IP address are checking all settings in Network control panel. </s>
<s> They are as they should be. </s>
<s> I went to the routers address (192.168.0.1) and checked on attached devices. </s>
<s> This computer is no longer listed of course. </s>
<s> I pressed &quot;refresh&quot; but it still didn't show up. </s>
<s> I rebooted the router to no avail. </s>
<s> I need to determine why the computer IP address is locked and how to change it again. </s>
<s> any suggestions are greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Howdy, I have the same issue, for about a week now. </s>
<s> Provider sent me a new modem, but I unlocked it by going into my providers supplied software and loading a prior configuration. </s>
<s> However once I did this I lost my CD drives and am now at a point where my system will not boot. </s>
<s> Outside of my computer not booting, which could have been done by me, I was not able to access the internet from my PC. </s>
<s> I could access the internet wirelessly. </s>
<s> I am trying to recover and will repost if I get past my inability to boot the system. </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
