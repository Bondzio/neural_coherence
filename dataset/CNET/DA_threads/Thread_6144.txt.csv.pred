1.1.1	Hey guys , recently I purchased new RAM memory for my desktop .	St
1.1.2	It is 16GB Gskill RipjawsX 1600Mhz , with 10-10-10-30 timing .	St
1.1.3	I installed it , set proper timings and speed in BIOS , and after a few minutes of work , I got BSOD .	St
1.1.4	When I restarted my PC , it said it could not load my graphic card drivers .	St
1.1.5	I downloaded newest one from nVidia site , I thought it might be a problem because I was using beta drivers .	St
1.1.6	But the same thing happen .	St
1.1.7	I went and reset speed and timings to auto , which is 1333Mhz , 9-9-9-24 , and since then it is working properly , which is some 2-3 hours .	St
1.1.8	I was hoping someone can help me with this problem .	St
1.1.9	Anyway , my configuration is : AMD FX-8320 3.5Ghz Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 nVidia GeForce GTX480 WD 1TB HD .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Under such circumstances it 's telling you what 's best to operate at or safe level .	St
1.3.2	Even , if the ram is capable the other half is the mtrbd. , etc .	St
1.3.3	to keep pace .	St
1.3.4	If you had n't yet , look into the bios update level .	St
1.3.5	if it has moved beyond your current level , it 's a good bet it handles ram better .	St
1.3.6	It 's worth the upgrade provided it addresses ram issues .	St
1.3.7	The mere fact you set the ram level manually says it needs help .	St
1.3.8	As already post to you , up the voltage , .01 until its happy .	St
1.3.9	Allow to work with higher voltage but do n't push it .	St
1.3.10	If you install in *ALL* ram slots , timing can be a critical issue long posted for yrs .	St
1.3.11	as a critical factor for ram .	St
1.3.12	A good check is to view the ram status response using PCWizard 2012 and read that all ram is actually the same , regardless of what the sticker states on ram itself .	St
1.3.13	Google for PCWizard to install it .	St
1.3.14	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	I do n't think the speed or timings are the problem .	St
1.4.2	I tried reinstalling my old RAM , and I also got BSOD while trying to download GW2.I ran memtest and it came back with approx .	St
1.4.3	7k errors .	St
1.4.4	I ran memtest with new RAM and I got 40k errors on first pass .	St
1.4.5	The BSOD I was getting before was irql_not_less_or_equal , now I am getting pfn_list_corrupt stop 0x0000004e .	St
1.4.6	Also , my computer would work for hour or two , but as soon as I would try to download something ( the only thing I actually tried downloading was GW2 ) it would get BSOD .	St
1.5.1	If you ca n't get memtest to run error free ... ..stop .	St
1.5.2	Use memtest as your test vehicle and fix the machine .	St
1.5.3	Since you have ram faults you want to see 12 & gt ; 24 hrs of memtest with zero errors .	St
1.6.1	If you do n't think ram is the problem , what 's left ?	Ques
1.6.2	that 's the mtrbd .	St
1.6.3	and all it entails .	St
1.6.4	Further , you state now you have errors during tests , so you basically know there 's a problem .	St
1.6.5	That should have all been posted in the 1st post , so answers can get to the point .	St
1.6.6	Now , from POV there 's really nothing that can be done because it relies on the mtrbd .	St
1.6.7	to be fixed or patched .	St
1.6.8	As i stated , if a bios level is behind , do that as a last resort .	St
1.6.9	You clean out the ram slots as well with alcohol and toothbrush , allow to dry and then retry ram .	St
1.6.10	if the problem persists , it maybe better to get a mtrbd .	St
1.6.11	replacement .	St
1.6.12	Since this also happens with old ram too .	St
1.6.13	You should also look for & quot ; bad caps & quot ; , even a minor weak cap with cause issues , plus a PSU swap to check as a stable power test .	St
1.6.14	Otherwise , you 're left with a mtrbd .	St
1.6.15	problem if nothing seems to fix it .	St
1.6.16	I would do a tear down place on cardboard and test that way , one item at a time for basic or minimum system .	St
1.6.17	because it works and then BSOD when you try to d/l suggest that really you 're in a ram stack that has n't been reached yet , so effectively you enter a ram area and then & quot ; poof & quot ; .	St
1.6.18	You 're hitting whatever is causing ram issue .	St
1.6.19	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
