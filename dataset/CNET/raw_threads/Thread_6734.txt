We installed a Netgear WG511v2 wireless PC card for him to be able to connect to the internet through our existing wireless router. Since then there is an alarm/sound that seems to play every few minutes and sometimes seconds. We're thinking it's something to do with the network connecting. Not sure. Anyway, went into Control Panel into sounds and there's nothing there. I even changed it to &quot;no sound&quot; and the alarm/sound still played. It is very annoying. I disabled the network and the sound did not play. Anyone have any ideas how to get rid of it? Thanks.

LadyDi23, you looked in the &quot;right place&quot; assuming Netgear had used the MS sound protocol... alas, no. I understand your problem--the chimy-chime sound it makes is the same as the default Outlook Mail notification sound. Annoying and/or confusing! Turning off the sound is anything but intuitive. To DISABLE the sound, double click on the Netgear icon in the system tray which will open the &quot;Netgear WG511v2 Smart Wizard.&quot; On the settings tab, at the bottom in the blue connection info bar (contains signal strength at right, antenna w/ name at left), right click on the &quot;Connected to Internet&quot; text and then select &quot;Disable Notification&quot; To CHANGE the sound, rename ConnectToInternet.wav (in C:\Program Files\NETGEAR\WG511v2 or wherever you installed your router files) to ConnectToInternet_old.wav. Copy your new favorite sound into that directory and rename it ConnectToInternet.wav. Enjoy. Hope this helped!

I finally typed &quot;can't get rid of chime sound on computer&quot; and got to this page. I realized I had installed a netgear product for wireless internet a couple months ago. I then followed your instructions and no sound since!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've spent hours and hours trying to figure this out. Thank you so so so so much!

I was losing my mind trying to figure out first of all where the chime was coming from and, then once I traced it to netgear, finding out a way to disable it. I had no idea it was this simple or easy to fix. Thanks again!
