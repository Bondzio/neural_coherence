<s> I recently bought a computer from Cyberpower. </s>
<s> AM2 platform, X2 5000+, 2 gigs RAM, 250 gig hard drive, ATI Gecube Radeon X1900 XT vid card (I installed it). </s>
<s> I plugged the computer in to an old CRT moniter, installed the vid card drivers, and everything went smoothly except for the fact that the colors were off. </s>
<s> I messed with the moniter settings, but that did little. </s>
<s> I unplugged my old computer, which was using a 17&quot; medion LCD display, who's colors were quite good. </s>
<s> I plugged the LCD into the new computer, and the colors still didn't work. </s>
<s> I tried using the moniter presets, and also fiddled with the color balance, and even installed the latest video card drivers. </s>
<s> Although the blue and green colors were now fine, red displayed as black. </s>
<s> Nothing I could do changed that. </s>
<s> If you have any ideas of how to fix this, please help. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> On-Board video?? </s>
<s> (if you have it) If not, can you grab another vid card (a cheepie is fine) to use as a tester. </s>
<s> Sounds like a bad or incompatible card if your drivers are right In the end you may be winding up with a NVIDIA </s>
