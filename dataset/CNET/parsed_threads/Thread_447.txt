<s> Hi all, I'm currently running Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit on an Intel Duo 2.2GHz with 2 gigs of RAM. </s>
<s> I recently acquired a Panasonic TX-26LXD50 TV, with the intention of using it as my primary monitor so I could play WoW on a larger screen. </s>
<s> I've connected it via a SCART to S-Video cable. </s>
<s> The problem is that the setup for my graphics card (NVidia GeForce 8400GS) informs me that I can't have a resolution higher than 1024x768 on the TV, which is rather blurry and not very easy on my eyes. </s>
<s> I've tried updating my graphics card driver (which did allow me to choose 1440x900 for my -smaller- monitor, but not the TV... </s>
<s> I also tried using PowerStrip to force a custom resolution, but if anything that's worsened the problem. </s>
<s> Can anyone possibly help me to fix this, or even just inform me that what I want to do isn't possible and I just wasted money on a TV I don't need? </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> Sorry, bummer. </s>

<s> Should I have used something else? </s>
<s> which do not make good monitor use. </s>
<s> I think the RGB might make better connection for computer use. </s>
<s> DVI or HDMI different Vid card(s). </s>
<s> DVI would give you Video only, you would have to tap off for audio, HDMI would give you both. </s>
<s> Your computer specs are a bit light, however and you would likely, unless you already have, need to upgrade the power supply, assuming this is a storebought puter. </s>
<s> Plus 2gb of ram with Vista will just get you by with 32 bit system try to run 3gb, if possible. </s>
<s> Yes PAL might be a tad lower or higher depending on how you look at it, but at 480 lines the screen should be only good for playing a DVD. </s>
