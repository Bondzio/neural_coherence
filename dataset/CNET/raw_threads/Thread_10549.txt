I'm mostly doing heavy Photoshop work with some Premiere work, and I'm gaming only occasionnally. - i7 3770K - ASRock Fatal1ty Z77 Performance - Ventirad Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - Kit Dual Channel DDR3 Kingston HyperX XMP Blu Red, 2 x 4 Go, PC3-12800, CAS 9 - ASUS GeForce GTX 660 Ti Direct CU II, 2 Go - SSD SanDisk Ultra Plus, 128 Go, SATA III - Seagate Barracuda, 2 To - Xigmatek Midgard II case - PSU Be Quiet Pure Power L8, 630W Is there anything unneccessary or is there a bottleneck somewhere? More importantly, is there a serious compatibility problem? Thank you very much!

Proffitt	5/1/13 9:37 AM	1.36740102E12	Seems OK.	http://www.bequiet.com/en/powersupply/250 has me checking the dual rail +12V but at 30A each and looking at the power tests I think it's OK. I see you going for the somewhat expert OS install on SSDD so let's hope you have support handy for that. Bob

My concern is more about the GPU, isn't that a little over the board as I don't think I'll be playing a lot of heavy games? Is the 660 or the HD7870 (or even slightly lower) still acceptable?
