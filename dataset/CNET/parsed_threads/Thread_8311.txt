<s> I have had this for a couple of years now without problems. </s>
<s> All of a sudden the scanning and copying options are a major headache. </s>
<s> every time I try to copy or scan a page, the image/copy comes out with an approx 3 inch wide black bar that runs the length of the page. </s>
<s> Printing isn't a problem, therefore I am assuming that it's something to do with the actual scanning hardware. </s>
<s> Any help or advice will be gratefully appreciated. </s>
<s> ps. </s>
<s> If there's a way I can attach an example, please let me know. </s>
<s> There is an scanning element or component in the scanning head that fails and you get color shifts to outright white or black stripes. </s>
<s> Since repairs cost more than replacement we perform the last rites. </s>
<s> Thanks for the very prompt reply. </s>
<s> I kind of thought that would be the case. </s>
<s> Time to review wireless AOI printers I guess. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> the Dell 964 is NOT a wireless printer. </s>
<s> If you are using a wireless print adapter 3300. </s>
<s> I can give you instructions on how to set this up but, you have to tell your machine NOT to update the drivers for anything. </s>
<s> This is usually how they get messed up. </s>
<s> Disconnect your printer. </s>
<s> Download and run this patch to completely remove the printer from your computer. </s>
<s> You may have to open the patch with Winrar or 7zip . </s>
<s> ***Please note the patch has a problem and will also remove the 3300 wireless print Utility and Dell Quickset. </s>
<s> Please make sure to reinstall these programs, if you have a Dell Computer. </s>
<s> Restart your computer. </s>
<s> Fix your network first. </s>
<s> Update the firmware in your wireless router. </s>
<s> Manufacturer's website, make & Model needed. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID(You may want to change this to make it easier to connect) Use WPA-PSK(TKIP) Security. </s>
<s> Most wireless devices work best with this type of security. </s>
<s> Mixed b and g mode(n if available) Use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Most devices work better on these channels. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> Power everything off for 30 seconds. </s>
<s> Power everything back on, wait 30 seconds,now try to connect. </s>
<s> After router is done, now setup your wireless print server/printer. </s>
<s> 3300 Utility 3300 Firmware Attach the 3300 to your computer using the USB Cable and insert the 3300 disk. </s>
<s> Follow the instructions. </s>
<s> It should ask you for the network ID, type of security and password. </s>
<s> Now setup the printer. </s>
<s> Download the proper drivers. </s>
<s> XP Drivers Vista 32-bit Drivers All other Drivers Install the drivers, choose network, choose I'm using a wireless print server(if you do not see this, then choose add printer and you should see it then) and follow the instructions. </s>

<s> Hi PudgyOne, Have had my dell 964 for a while but recently changed routers and since then cannot get any of my computers to recognize the printer driver during installation. </s>
<s> Have gone through the whole step wise proces with no luck. </s>
<s> Any other advice. </s>
<s> I have a mad with parallels with winxows xp and a pc with windows xp. </s>
<s> I seem to always get stuck at the point where it just does not recognize the mac address or the ip address. </s>
<s> Many forget what a new feature may do. </s>
<s> For example I'm running into folk that enable Client or AP Isolation and then spend months pondering why it won't work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You MUST setup the 3300 all over again. </s>
<s> It needs to have the new communications with the wireless router. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Yup, went through the whole process of setting up the router again. </s>
<s> I can actually go to the printers ip address and also confirm this but for whatever reason the computer stlll don't recognize it during network installations of the printer. </s>
<s> Is there a manual way to set up the printer using the mac address and or ip address through the printer wizard on xp?? </s>
<s> Thanx for all your help </s>
<s> the instructions are noted in our Forum Sticky . </s>
<s> If you're using some type of Mac Address Filtering, that is NOT listed in the forum sticky and will cause you problems and headaches. </s>
