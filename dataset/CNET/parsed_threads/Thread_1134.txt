<s> Hello, I received a complaint from a user that he could not print (small-office, SBS2003SPI Premium, 10 clients). </s>
<s> His PC and other clients are wireless, Win2K all patches. </s>
<s> The printer he uses is physically connected to another client in the same sub-office. </s>
<s> All network printers are shared and visible in the network directory, but I cannot connect to any network printer with any User account on this PC. </s>
<s> When I try to access printer Properties (as SBS User) to print a test page I am given the warning: &quot;explorer.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows&quot; Logged in to the same PC as SBS Administrator, all printers work. </s>
<s> I changed User's Permissions in Server Management to Net Admin and the printer works, no error messages. </s>
<s> Ran SFC /SCANNOW and it completed fine. </s>
<s> The printer was working, so I am guessing the user of PC fiddled with some system settings affecting all users. </s>
<s> I do NOT want him running as Net Admin!!! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Tony </s>
<s> I would look in the Event Viewer for clues. </s>
