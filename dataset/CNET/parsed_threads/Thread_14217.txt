<s> My wife bought an ACER desktop a few months ago. </s>
<s> Compter would not power on 90% of the time. </s>
<s> ACER sent another computer. </s>
<s> A month later ALL the USB ports were dead. </s>
<s> They would be recognized only one out of ten times the computer was powered on. </s>
<s> ACER overnighted a new mother board and promised a tech support guy to provide their &quot;on-site&quot; support. </s>
<s> Guy never showed, never called. </s>
<s> We finally called corporate and after an hour or so got his pager number. </s>
<s> Claimed his car was towed and he was at the Chrysler dealership. </s>
<s> Asked to speak to someone at the dealership to conform. </s>
<s> Ooops....he hung up...caught in a lie. </s>
<s> Now waiting 30 minutes for ACER &quot;technical support&quot;. </s>
<s> STAY AWAY FROM ACER......you have been warned!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> and you see 50 HPs and 50 Compaqs and 50 Gateways and 25 Macs and 3 Acers and there $150.00 dollars cheaper then all the rest. </s>
<s> What do you expect? </s>
<s> I beat you can't see what I'm talking about. </s>
<s> By the way, HP and Compaq are the same company. </s>
<s> This thread is untracked. </s>
