I have a 90 watt power supply in my HP 7840 Pavilion.
I know, I know thats pitiful but what I want to do is get the most that I can from this dinosaur.
My machine runs great its old but its updated to that max.
I have a GForce 4 mmx 440 se 64 meg Pci card that requires a 250 watt power supply.
I've been running it on 90 watts for a couple years and i'm not getting the most from it.
My question is; can I upgrade to at least a 250 watt power supply without frying my system?
?
