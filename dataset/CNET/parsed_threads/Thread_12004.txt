<s> Recently I bought a new cheap laptop because my previous one had some over-heating problem. </s>
<s> The model of the new one is HP 255, some basic specs are like this: AMD E2-2000 1.75G CPU INTEGRATED Radeon HD 7340 Graphic card 4G DDR3 1600 RAM 500 G HDD hard disk. </s>
<s> Win8 OS I never use the computer to play game or watch HD movies, so I thought even this cheap one (300 euros) can satisfy me. </s>
<s> But after I got this, I noticed the performance is really really bad. </s>
<s> There is even some freezing when I browse the web pages. </s>
<s> Flash video is not smooth either, crappier than my 3 years old laptop. </s>
<s> The Windows Experience Index is 3.9, which is again much lower than my previous laptop, a 3 years old ThankPad T400 (4.8). </s>
<s> So I am really frustrated and got confused why a model which was produced in the spring this year can be this bad. </s>
<s> And the specs didn't even look too bad compared to some other 500 euros laptops Then I re-checked the specs and noticed that the graphic card is integrated (didn't noticed that before). </s>
<s> Could it be the reason why the system is so slow? </s>
<s> Do you think increasing the RAM, for example, to 8GB will help it? </s>
<s> And like how much the improvement would be? </s>
<s> Like I mentioned, I don't use it to play games. </s>
<s> I only need a laptop that I can browse web smoothly. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I tried one of those systems and ended up giving it to my brother as an loaner in his office. </s>
<s> It's really bad compared to better CPUs. </s>
<s> I'd get my money back and try again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ram upgrade isn't going to help, Bob has the right idea, this processor isn't going to cut the mustard.. </s>
