I wasn't aware that we had to convince you of anything.
All you wanted to know was if your game would play on a Mac Mini.
I'm also confused about your statement that the 2Ghz processors on a Mac is not the same as a 2Ghz processor on a PC.
This despite the fact that they are both Core 2 Duo's, are both made by Intel, and are both clocked at 2Ghz.
Hey, it's exactly the same chip.
The difference is speed, faster on a Mac, is because the OS is meaner and leaner and is written to take advantage of the 2 cores.
Windows is not.
This may be a little simplistic but, a processor with 2 cores running at 2.33GHz should really be faster than a processor with one core running at 3Ghz, Once again, you can always keep your existing PC, get a Mac and a KVM switch.
Use the Mac for real work and the PC for your gaming P
