I have finally located the drivers for Microsoft Broadband PCI Adapter Card.
MN-730 and the rest of them.
I got these directly from the cd.
Email me for them It s a zip file.
25 megs.
If anyone knows of a place I can store this on the net and share it, I would be happy to.
I went thur hell to get them.
