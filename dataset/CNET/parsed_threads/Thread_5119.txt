<s> My mobo only supports 4X agp. </s>
<s> I wanted to upgrade to a better video card but I am not sure what to do here. </s>
<s> Does anyone have a suggstion other than replacing the mobo? </s>
<s> Would cards advertised as 8X work on this system? </s>
<s> But many get derailed by odd or miswritten instructions on AGP cards. </s>
<s> If the AGP card fits and if your machine's power supply can supply the extra Watts then it's fine 99.99% of the time. </s>

<s> I know the Nvidia cards will work as long as the slot is 1.5v and not the old 3v slot.you won't get the advertised performance gains running a 8X card in a 4X slot, but you should notice an increase in performance over your old card. </s>
<s> As far as the ATI cards, I haven't used them enough to offer an opinion. </s>
<s> &quot;I know the Nvidia cards will work as long as the slot is 1.5v and not the old 3v slot.&quot; Please research this one and discover that the AGP card requests the voltage and there is no set value on the AGP voltage. </s>
<s> This is the area that confuses most as they try to verify they have a 1.5V AGP slot and can't. </s>
<s> The really old AGP slot in question won't let the 8X card plug in. </s>
