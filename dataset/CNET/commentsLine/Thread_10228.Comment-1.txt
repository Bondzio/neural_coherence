i currently have a dell dimension 8250. my current specs are as follow... processor: intel(r) pentium(r) 4 cpu 2.40ghz memory (ram): 256 mb hard drive: 80 gb (in reality, 74.49...) video card: 128 ddr ati radeon 9700 tx w/tv-out interestingly, i had no problem playing splinter cell 3 on this machine.
however, when i tried to play far cry, the game loaded fine (slowly albeit) but the colors and shapes were...well, crazy; hard to explain.
the colors were fine, but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope.
am i making any sense?
i think i am going to up my memory to 512 mb.
can i upgrade my graphics card?
will either of these upgrades void my warranty?
when i purchased the computer, i settled on the extended warranty, and i still have 280 some days left before it runs out.
any insight is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!
