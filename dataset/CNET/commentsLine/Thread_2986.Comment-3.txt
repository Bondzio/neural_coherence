you ask new questions so let's tackle those head on.
&quot; what do people do who work in large office buildings or apartment buildings regarding wireless routers.
most likely they cannort have a router on each floor.
if i cannot relocate from the basement where it is now what would you recommend?
maybe a bridge using 2 routers or what?
&quot; a bridge might have wifi on the other end.
i've noted ac powerline bridges that have wifi at one end which is a really nice and easy to setup solution.
and you could use 2 routers with some bridge but some folk are challenged by the configuration (which is noted in this forum's sticky post about post 18 or 19.)
the wndr3700 is a great choice but when we don't follow the maker's recommendations we often are disappointed.
example at  post 3 notes more.
you can try just one wndr3700 in the basement and have a backup plan if you are disappointed.
