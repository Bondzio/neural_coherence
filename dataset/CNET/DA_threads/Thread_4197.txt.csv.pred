1.1.1	Hello everyone, I have a 2003 Western Digital 40GB IDE hard drive.	St
1.1.2	My purpose for this hard drive was to run Windows Sever 2003 for a server.	St
1.1.3	I went to reinstall Windows on it, and after the setup says &quot;Starting Windows&quot; I get a BSOD with PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA , error, I know it is the hard drive and not the ram.	St
1.1.4	I Have used 5 different ram sticks, each individually.	St
1.1.5	The hard drive was working just a few days ago in this pc.	St
1.1.6	This hard drive works in my HP Pavilion a810n, but not on this older Pentium 3 motherboard.	St
1.1.7	I have done extensive formatting, and still nothing.	St
1.1.8	The PC thinks the hard drive is just about 60GB when its really 40GB.	St
1.1.9	Help!	St
1.1.10	Please!	St
1.1.11	Thank you!	St
1.2.1	That's strange.	St
1.2.2	Things to try: 1.	St
1.2.3	What does the BIOS say about its capacity?	St
1.2.4	2.	St
1.2.5	How does it behave when used as an external disk?	St
1.2.6	3.	St
1.2.7	Formatting is one thing, deleting an rebuilding the partition(s) on it is another thing.	St
