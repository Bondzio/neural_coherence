1.1.1	Hello all , I am trying to copy some files from an external hard drive to another drive .	St
1.1.2	At first I have to wait for a while as it says & quot ; Preparing to copy ... & quot ; and then it copies very slowly .	St
1.1.3	After copying a few ( different number every time I try ) files , it gives me the following message : & quot ; Can not copy file : Can not read from the source file or disk. & quot ; I have also received the following message a few times while trying to copy : & quot ; Can not Copy [ filename ] : The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error. & quot ; I am receiving these errors when I either copy to an internal Hard Drive or external Hard Drive .	St
1.1.4	I ran a check disk , and it came back with the following message & quot ; Windows was unable to complete the disk check. & quot ; I am very confused as I can access the files on the external drive , but it runs slowly as I try to open or navigate through the external drive .	St
1.1.5	Also , I am confused , because it lets me copy some of the files , but then at some point gives me a error message .	St
1.1.6	What can I do to copy files from the external hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.7	I hope you can help me as I have some very important files on the external drive , which I ofcourse did n't backup .	St
1.1.8	Also , please let me know if there are other options available to me such as recovery services or recovery programs if I can not solve it on my own with your help .	Sug
1.1.9	Thank you in advance ! !	St

1.2.1	There 's a small chance it 's a problem with your PC ( the USB-port ) , so try the same things you do now on another PC .	St
1.2.2	If that 's OK , the external drive is OK .	St
1.2.3	The next small chance is that it 's an issue of the electronics in the case .	St
1.2.4	That 's easy to check by putting the drive in another case .	St
1.2.5	The most likely thing is that the disk has gone south .	St
1.2.6	The only solution then : replace it .	St
1.2.7	Try to get off as many files as you can , and if that 's not enough find your creditcard and go to a professional data recovery company to do the others .	St
1.2.8	For the future : BACKUP !	St
1.2.9	Kees	St
1.3.1	I have multiple external hard drives though that are attached to the same usb port and they all work fine , so do you still think it could be a problem with the computer ?	Ques
1.4.1	I 'd concentrate on case and drive .	St
1.4.2	Kees	St
1.5.1	I have the problematic external drive plugged into one of two USB ports on the front of the computer , so I decided to plug it into a USB port in the back of the computer after what you said .	St
1.5.2	It works GREAT now !	St
1.5.3	Thanks you VERY much !	St
1.5.4	I really appreciate the simple suggestion that nobody else has offered .	St
1.5.5	I am currently backing up all the info onto another external drive that I have plugged into the second USB port on the front of the computer .	St
1.5.6	I am happy that it works now and I was able to avoid having to pay for file recovery , but I am confused as to why one of the two front USB ports is running correctly , and the other is n't .	St
1.5.7	Should n't they be connected ?	Ques
1.5.8	Any Ideas ?	Ques
1.6.1	Upon putting my second external drive into a USB port on the back of the computer , I noticed it 's ALOT faster than the USB port in the front , so I now see that BOTH of my front USB ports are not running correctly ?	Ques
1.6.2	How can I fix this ?	Ques
1.7.1	Look inside your machine .	St
1.7.2	If you see 4 separate wires from motherboard to the front USB connection then it 's USB 1.1 .	St
1.7.3	You can complain to the machine 's maker but this is how most machines were made .	St
1.8.1	The two front USB Ports worked before , so I 'm not really sure what you mean	St
1.9.1	No one cares it worked before .	St
1.9.2	Would n't you want it to work from now on ?	Ques
1.10.1	It ran fast before this problem came up so I do n't see how it can be a limitation of my machine , since it was working fine at some point .	St
1.11.1	Consider that machines , capacitors age , timings skew and what was is no more .	St
1.11.2	I know this one inside out and share so you can save yourself a lot of time .	St
1.12.1	thanks for the insight .	Polite
1.12.2	Can i get a usb extender thing and plug it into one of the usb ports in the back of the computer so i can get a bunch more 2.0 usb ports ?	Ques
1.13.1	Some replace the wiring .	St
1.13.2	Your choice on the solution .	Sug
