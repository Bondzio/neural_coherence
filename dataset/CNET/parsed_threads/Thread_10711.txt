<s> Hello everyone, if their is anyone out there that knows alot about hard drives- i like some help. </s>
<s> I put together a computer with a Asus P5LDe-Deluxe board, everything is great. </s>
<s> all connections cool -execpt for one problem-. </s>
<s> bought a new 320G Western digital (SATA 2) drive and had an existing Western Digital 250G (SATA 1) drive. </s>
<s> I formatted the new SATA 2 drive s boot drive- the old SATA 1 drive was already formated. </s>
<s> though they both show up in BIOS i cant see the SATA 1(old drive) in -My Computer-. </s>
<s> tried disk manager utility in windows and the W.D Data Lifeguard program- thought with SATA all drives where compatable. </s>
<s> i mean SATA 1 and SATA 2, do i have to step down the SATA 2 drive to SATA 1 spec. </s>
<s> with jumper? </s>
<s> cant figure it out. </s>
<s> should be no need for slave or master on SATA, right? </s>
<s> Hope someone can point me in right direction. </s>
<s> thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Drives don't show in Windows until they are partitioned and even then I need to format them. </s>
<s> Your post is void of the details for me to comment further. </s>

<s> more infomation: i had one drive, my original drive(SATA 1), bought second drive(SATA 2)used on ASUS P5LD2 mother board. </s>
<s> can a SATA 1 drive work with a SATA 2 drive? </s>
<s> both show up as bootable but the SATA 2 drive, is the primary. </s>
<s> i want to be able to log into old drive to copy files or use seperately. </s>
<s> i can format it as storage drive- but lose all info- i want to copy it's files first. </s>
<s> was thinking maybe i can use windows disk to repair the partion (or fix windows) maybe that might allow it to show in -MY COMPUTER -in windows and allow me to use it. </s>
<s> the SATA 1 drive shows up on everything- but MY COMPUTER in windows- and in disk management there is no drive letter. </s>
<s> in SATA config. </s>
<s> on the board, i have the 320g(SATA2)as the primary drive- plug 1 (the RED one) and the original drive the SATA 1 drive is on the slave SATA plug 3 (the BLACK one)- this is designation on the Asus motherboard SATA plug 1+2 master and SATA plug 3+4 slave. </s>
<s> hope this will help you more. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Absolutely. </s>
<s> But your issues appear to be related to nothing in your first post. </s>
<s> No mention that the drive was used in some other system so I wouldn't note that this is often how people learn about backing up what they can't lose. </s>
<s> Look up ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and I wish you luck, Bob </s>
<s> thanks to the person who has taken effort to reply- thanks bob. </s>
<s> it maybe hard to understand, but i did what i was trying to do- and learned more about drives. </s>
<s> sata controllers work independantly- i was pretty sure. </s>
<s> there was no reason why my old formatted drive should not show up. </s>
<s> but only my new drive that had been formatted showed. </s>
<s> i just fooled with the windows cd and loaded some of the drivers from the cd. </s>
<s> and low and behold this drive is now reconized in My Computer. </s>
<s> i put both on the sata master inputs(the red ones)- i did this before so i think the drivers on the windows cd helped the windows install reconize the drive. </s>
<s> the bios has always reconised it (drive that wasnt seen in windows). </s>
<s> now if i could just find a good program or find a way to transfer files- but now that i think. </s>
<s> datalifeguard will probly work. </s>
<s> thanks, bye. </s>
<s> not out of the woods yet- drive is showing, but cant access my user folder on drive. </s>
<s> says that i dont have permissions. </s>
<s> is there a procedure or settings i can adjust to allow me to acess the old SATA 1 drive main folder and files. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Just type XP TAKE OWNERSHIP into google.com and pick the solution you like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok i'll give the google search a try- ran into this problem before,but just formatted- dont want to lose files this time. </s>
<s> thanks again. </s>
<s> thanks alot man- you the man. </s>
<s> you really help me. </s>
<s> cant figure out how i got the drive to be reconized. </s>
<s> my first Motherboard (before this new one that i used old drive in)stopped working. </s>
<s> and i found two viruses on old drive, but only after it was reconized. </s>
<s> do you think the windows cd had something to do with it, when i reinstalled the drivers( but it was already showing in bios, and disk manager- just not in My Computer?, and no hardware issues in device manager? </s>
<s> any way this is what i knew could happen with these drives, and we worked it out. </s>
<s> so thanks again for the info BOB- the last bit totally helped. </s>
<s> i'ld like to know what you think allowed the drive to be reconized, or was it a quirky thing. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> sorry forgot to ask this, will try it. </s>
<s> but i should have no problems no doing a simply drag and drop from one drive to the next to transfer files- this could however spead a virus right. </s>
<s> I'm sure you've read stories where we uninstall and reinstall software and it works the second time. </s>
<s> I can't explain it. </s>
