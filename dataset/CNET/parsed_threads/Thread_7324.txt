<s> I was all set on getting the 6250 emachine when i called dell to see what they would do. </s>
<s> They claim they can give me a similarly configured 4700 (i know they say its not sold anymore and they did not mentioned it was refurbished) for $100 more than the emachine. </s>
<s> The only real difference is the Hard drive 160 dell vs. 200 emachine. </s>
<s> Anyone have any thoughts? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If it's not sold any more and they have one? </s>
<s> Sounds like it's a refurb to me. </s>
<s> I'm from the build you own camp, but if came down to NEW Emachine vrs a refurb Dell, I would buy the NEW Emachine. </s>

<s> I just spoke with Dell they said it is NOT refurbished. </s>
<s> So I'm looking at $100 more. </s>
<s> I didn't see that you posted all the specs, but even for the same RAM I'm not sure I'd pay $100 more, and the dell has less? </s>
<s> the emachine is an amd 3400+ the dell a P4 2.8ghz, both with 1g of memory, bot dvd r/w, integrated graphics, no monitor. </s>
<s> Only real major difference is the emachine has 200 mb HD and the dell 160. </s>
<s> Both 1 yr warranty </s>
<s> from what I haev heard about them on this forum lately. </s>
<s> FWIW, I am not a Dell basher either. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I left specs at my office. </s>
<s> You cant get them online anymore because they dont show the 4700 for sale. </s>
<s> My only issue with the emachine is the benchmark scores vs. the 4700, but would I even be able to tell? </s>
