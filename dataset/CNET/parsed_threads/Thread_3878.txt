<s> Quite some time ago i got the Philips toUcam pro ii, i rushed the install and ignored the &quot;you must restart your computer before using this device&quot; and it has never worked on my pc since, it works on other computers fine. </s>
<s> but here's the really strange bit, i have re-installed the operating system on my computer, and it still doesn't work with this one....i don't understand it, my pc itself may be damaged because several of the problems that mad me re-install the operating system still occur (e.g loss of sound until i go into stand by, hibernation, or restart. </s>
<s> and i cant record from the line in/microphone port)any help or advice would be much appreciated. </s>

<s> Your issues sound exactly like a retail OS installed on a laptop. </s>
