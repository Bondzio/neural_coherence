When I start my PC in the morning it will begin to POST, then restart several times. At that point, it sometimes will almost completely boot to my Desktop and then begin the boot process again. This continues for about 20 minutes or so. Soemtimes less, sometimes more. Once the PC is up and running, I can restart, if needed, without a problem. If run my anitvirus and spyware programs religiously and have found nothing. Could this be a power supply issue? Could this be the IDE controller on my motherboard? ............Any thoughts? Thanks.
