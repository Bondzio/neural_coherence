oh wow this is annoying.
i bought a linksys wireless N PCI card, and i had two problems, one was resolved in another thread about using WPA encryption, and the other is I had a stuttering problem which didn't exist on the wireless-G usb by linksys.
so i decided to try a D-Link wireless-N usb adapter to replace the PCI one, thinking the PCI was causing interference with my PCI soundcard.
well, it stutters alright, but another check back on the wireless-G usb card shows no stuttering.
any ideas?
