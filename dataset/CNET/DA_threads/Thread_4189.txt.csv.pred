1.1.1	Hi , My parents have a Dell Dimension 4100 and they have started to complain that it is slow .	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to determine whether I should try and upgrade this computer or if I should just buy or build them a new one .	St
1.1.3	I 've never built a system before and the only upgrade I 've done is adding some RAM , so your advice will certainly be welcome .	St
1.1.4	Here are some specs on the existing system ( I apologize for the length of the post ) : System Info Model : Dell Dimension 4100 Chassis Type : 2X Service Tag : GDRX101 Operating System : Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 ( Build 2600 ) Processor Number Of Processors : 1 Type : Intel Pentium III EB 866 MHz Processors Bus Speed : 133 MHz Motherboard Manufacturer : IntelCorporation Model : D815EEA Rev .	St
1.1.5	AAA10383-206 CPU Slot/Socket Type : Socket 370 FC-PGA Chipset Vendor : Intel i815/E/EP Rev .	St
1.1.6	A2 Bios Manufacturer : Intel Corp. Bios Version : A04 Graphics Model : nVidia AGP Riva TNT2 M64 AGP Speed : 4x Monitor : Dell P991 Storage Hard Drive 1 : QUANTUM FIREBALLP LM30.0 Size : 28.63 GB Memory Total RAM Installed : 384 MB Type : SDRAM DIMM PC133 Used RAM Slots : 2 of 2 Accessories USB Version : 1.1 Here 's some more info on the processor : Number Of Processors : 1 Type : Intel Pentium III EB 866 MHz Package : Socket 370 FC-PGA Manufacturer Codename : Coppermine Clock Speed : 864 MHz Clock Multiplier : 6.5 Front Side Bus ( FSB ) Speed : 133 MHz L2 Cache Size : 256 KBytes Stepping : cB0 Trace Width : 0.18 Microcode : 14h Instruction Sets : MMX , SSE Here 's some more info on the RAM situation : I previously upgraded the RAM to 384 MB from the 128 MB the system came with .	St
1.1.7	There are two sockets and I currently have a 256 MB RAM module in one and a 128 MB RAM module in the other .	St
1.1.8	I could upgrade the RAM to a maximum of 512 MB by replacing the 128 MB module in one socket with another 256 MB module .	St
1.1.9	However , I do n't think that the additional 128 MB would improve the performance that much .	St
1.1.10	I have done some research and while I 'm still not sure exactly what processors I can upgrade to , it appears I have several options ( Please correct me if I 'm wrong ) .	St
1.1.11	1 .	St
1.1.12	Upgrade the processor .	St
1.1.13	However , it seems that the socket will only support a Intel FC-PGA Pentium III ( 500~1.1G ) or a Celeron ( 533A-1.1G ) .	St
1.1.14	I 'm not sure if this would make a difference performance-wise , but I doubt it .	Res
1.1.15	2 .	St
1.1.16	Buy an upgrade adaptor in order to upgrade the Intel Coppermine ( socket 370 ) CPU to a Intel Tualatin-core CPU ( a Intel Tualatin FC-PGA2 processor - Pentium-III-S / Pentium-III / Celeron processors up to 1.4GHz . ) .	St
1.1.17	This could be accomplished without changing the motherboard , but it would require buying a new processor in addition to the adaptor .	St
1.1.18	While it seems like this would make a difference , I 'm not sure it would be worth the cost .	St
1.1.19	Here are two examples of & quot ; adaptors & quot ; that would accomplish this task : PL-Neo/T 1.4 GHz / 133 MHz FSB Intel & quot ; Tualatin & quot ; Pentium-III/S 512K L2 Cache 133 Front Side Bus http : //www.powerleap.com/PL-NeoT.jsp 370GU Tualatin CPU upgrade adaptor http : //www.upgradeware.com/english/ ... 370gu/370gu.htm 3 .	St
1.1.20	Upgrade the motherboard and buy a modern CPU .	St
1.1.21	While I 'm sure that this would make a big difference , I know it would cost quite a bit .	St
1.1.22	Also , I 'm not even sure what motherboards will work in the Dell Dimension 4100 , and if this would make sense given that the other existing components might have to be upgraded as well .	St
1.1.23	4 .	St
1.1.24	Buy another Dell ( the prices , when utilizing various discounts and taking advantage of & quot ; special deals & quot ; , seem hard to beat ) 5 .	St
1.1.25	Build a computer ( not sure I currently have the time or energy ) Well , let me know what you guys think , as you are the experts and I 'm not that knowledgeable about these matters .	St
1.1.26	At this point , I 'm leaning towards a new computer , as it seems the performance increase I would get from an upgrade would not be close to what I would get from a current system .	St
1.1.27	Thanks for your time !	St
1.2.1	The cost of upgrades will get you close to the cost of a new system box -- either from Dell or your own build .	St
1.2.2	The new components in a new system will be much faster and less troublesome than the best upgrades to your old system .	St
1.2.3	If you can find dirt cheap or free parts , I would consider maxing RAM to 512MB , installing a USB2.0 PCI card , and getting a better AGP 4X ( AGP4X/8X ) card that is compatible with your AGP slot voltage .	St
1.2.4	After all that , you may have to upgrade your PSU .	St
1.2.5	Again , this would only be a consideration for me if the parts were essentially free .	St
1.3.1	I do n't know for sure , but i 've been told that Dells flavor of windows might not like your swapping out a motherboard , and unless your parents would notice and be happy with a marginal increase in performance , your only real option seems to be buying a motherboard/cpu/memory combo .	St
1.4.1	my mother has a build in PC ( i build it ) Pentium 1.6 , 256mb memory .	St
1.4.2	my mother ask me PC is getting slower .	St
1.4.3	i try to reinstalled the windows making some configuration .	St
1.4.4	but same problem .	St
1.4.5	i see one on dell for Dimension E310 P4 Vista Capable $ 459 .	St
1.4.6	spec is Pentium 4 ( 3.0G ) , 1gb Ram , 80gb HD , 17 inch flat panel monitor and dvd rom ... what a cheap price .	St
1.4.7	my be you can check out in dell..	St
1.5.1	my mother has a build in PC ( i build it ) Pentium 1.6 , 256mb memory .	St
1.5.2	my mother ask me PC is getting slower .	St
1.5.3	i try to reinstalled the windows making some configuration .	St
1.5.4	but same problem .	St
1.5.5	i see one on dell for Dimension E310 P4 Vista Capable $ 459 .	St
1.5.6	spec is Pentium 4 ( 3.0G ) , 1gb Ram , 80gb HD , 17 inch flat panel monitor and dvd rom ... what a cheap price .	St
1.5.7	my be you can check out in dell..	St
1.6.1	It 's a slug .	St
1.6.2	While you wo n't be gaming on this machine , any current card , even a lowend fx5200 or fx6200 that fits will be under 50 bucks and give some life back to it .	St
1.6.3	Remember to set your sights a little low on this one but for web surfing and more it 's ok. Bob	St
1.7.1	You 're right ; you wo n't get a worthwhile increase in performance from upgrading that dinosaur .	St
1.7.2	Just get the cheapest Dell with 512MB of RAM	St
