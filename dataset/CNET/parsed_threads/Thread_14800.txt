<s> First off, I have never dealed with power supplies before. </s>
<s> The specs of my system are 512 mb ram, 2.5 ghz pentium 4, 80 gb hard drive. </s>
<s> it's decent for what I need. </s>
<s> anyway, I went to class this morning (I'm a college student) and I turned it off before I left. </s>
<s> When I returned, I went to turn it on and it didn't respond. </s>
<s> I tried flipping the switch in the back, didn't work, flipped it back, didn't work, unplugged it for 20 minutes then came back and tried it again, didn't work. </s>
<s> There is a small red switch on the back, one way says 15 the other says 230 on my power supply. </s>
<s> I tried flipping that, didn't work. </s>
<s> my computer is a northgate I-1, power supply is an ISO-300 and my computer won't turn on. </s>
<s> Someone help me please!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> A 300 Watt unit is on the small side but may be ok unless the machine was upgraded from what it came with. </s>
<s> The 15 is more likely 115. </s>
<s> This and the 220 is the voltage input selection. </s>
<s> 220 will not be proper for most of us. </s>
<s> If you feel its the power supply, then you can find 450 Watt units or larger (do not skimp!) </s>
<s> for not much money at newegg.com , compgeeks.com and other places. </s>
<s> Be sure to see if the AC cord powers up something else and that the power button is not defective. </s>
<s> Here's how I test such.. 1. </s>
<s> First unplug the AC. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Set it back to 115... 3. </s>
<s> Open the case and follow the power on button wires to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Unplug just that and rember where it went to on the mainboard. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Apply the AC, flip the power supply to on, then use a metal pen tip (or such conductive item) to short the two pins that the power on switch went to. </s>
<s> What happens? </s>
<s> Be alert since nothing is typical of a dead supply, while a twitch of the fans may indicate other dead parts. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are there any fans running when you hit the power switch/button on the front of your case? </s>
<s> If not, then I would suspect the power supply died. </s>
<s> You can find replacements online, or at Circuit City/Best Buy. </s>
<s> If you need help selecting one, please let me know and I can do some research for you. </s>
<s> ok.actually i know what to do with your computer. </s>
<s> Actually i also see this problem last 2 months. </s>
<s> I think u should buy a regulator. </s>
<s> Because regulator can monitor our computer. </s>
