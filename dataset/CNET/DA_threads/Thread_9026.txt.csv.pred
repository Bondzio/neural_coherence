1.1.1	This should be a fairly easy question I was just wondering if i buy a graphics card that is pci express 2.0 will it run in a standard pci express x 16 slot ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; PCIe 2.0 is backward and forward compatible with PCIe v1.x .	St
1.2.2	Graphic cards and motherboards designed for v2.0 will be able to work with v1.1 and v1.0 , and vice versa .	St
1.2.3	In some rare cases it is possible that a PCI-E 2.0 card will not work correctly on a PCI-E 1.0a slot .	St
1.2.4	This is only limited to certain video cards. & quot ; But since you declined specifics this is all that can be told .	St
1.3.1	well this seems to be what i was asking for i couldnt give much specifics because im looking a graphics cards and almost everyone that interested me was a 2.0 and my motherbaord only has the standard pci express slots and my current graphics card is a pci-e x16	St
1.4.1	Sometimes our members will share they did that or find reports of it working fine or not .	St
1.5.1	thats the thing i havent decided which one i want yet other than i know i want it to be a Nvida and most of the ones that i have looked are 2.0	St
1.6.1	details and specifics are where things potentially can go wrong , so like Bob said , when you have details it 'd not be a bad idea to run it up the flagpole .	St
1.6.2	Of course if you buy from reputable place they 'll have a fair return policy ( stores near where I live give 14 to 30 days - one mom-n-pop store gives just 7 days for refund , but will return for store credit up to 4 weeks ) .	St
1.6.3	I remember reading a report where they ran cards in PCIe 1x vs 2.0 .	St
1.6.4	Not only did they work well in both , but there was n't appreciable performance difference -- the diffs between cards is much bigger than the diffs btwn old and new PCIe .	St
1.6.5	As always , YMMV ...	St
1.7.1	The PCIe 2.0 cards are backwards compatable to PCIe x16 .	St
1.7.2	I just installed a GEforce 8800GT PCIe 2.0 card in a computer that has PCIe x16 motherboard and it installed without a hitch and is working fine .	St
