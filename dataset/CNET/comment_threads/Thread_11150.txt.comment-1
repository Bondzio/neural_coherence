I have recently purchased a Samsung BD-5300 smart blu ray, plugged in the ethernet cable, all was fine, I am able to download apps, watch youtube, bbc iplayer etc, but a box keeps appearing saying smarthub needs to be updated I click ok, then another box appears telling me no connection and to check network settings ?
Network must be fine if I am able to download apps and watch online ?
