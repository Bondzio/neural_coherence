It's only a year old, and have recently downloaded the netscape 8 browser. Every time I turn my PC on, I get lot's of pop-ups, and have been told by many friends to turn off internet explorer, because it does not have the pop up blockers built in like Netscape 8 , and the Firefox browsers. Please Help!!!

Out of the blue, even with no browsers open, you will get pop-ups on your screen. Go to my site below, scroll down to the Free Software link, and download one or both of two Messenger utilities. One will disable messenger &quot;Mesenger Disable&quot;, the other will uninstall it, &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot;. If you like Messenger (I hate it) just disable it as it can be reenabled later. I recommend uninstalling it. Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.

From there you can change what browser you'd like to use. -Ibrahim
