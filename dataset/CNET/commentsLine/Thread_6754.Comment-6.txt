mysterious wireless disconnections are caused by either buggy firmware (is your router fw up-to-date?)
or signal interference from 2.4ghz cordless phones, wireless security cameras or other wireless gadgets that use the same band.
the clue you gave is that it happens when the laptop and router are in the same room.
no new laptop or wireless card will fix these types of problems.
take your laptop to a library or coffee shop with wireless and try it there.
if the issue is due to interference at your house, you **might** be able to do better with changing channels or buying a newer mimo enabled wireless router.
if the interference is overly severe, you'll have to settle for wired connections only, short of starting a war with neighbors about their wireless devices.
