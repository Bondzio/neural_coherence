<s> HP a1250 - AMD Duel Core 3800+, 250 gb hd, 1gb ram cost - $793 HP M7248 - AMD Duel Core 4200+, all the rest the same PLUS addition of TV Tuner Cost - $993 Question: For 'normal' use such as internet, digital photos, light movie editing from camcorder, downloading mp3's, is the extra $200 worth it to jump to the 4200+. </s>
<s> I kind of want the tv tuner, but can live without it or think I could always add later. </s>
<s> Are these good prices? </s>
<s> just about 1k for a AMD 4200+ dual seems like it is. </s>
<s> thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> actually once I print the specs I did notice the a1250 just has an integrated ATI Radeon XPRESS video card, 255mb memory, while the m7248 has a ATIRadeon PCI-E card with TV tuner. </s>
<s> Does that mean the m7248 has a better video card since it is PCI-E versus integrated (plus obviously i know it includes the tuner). </s>
<s> I say you do get the HP M7248. </s>
<s> It is always good to have a graphics card and it seems the HP M7248 has an ATI All-In-Wonder card which is a combination of a graphics card and a tv tuner. </s>
<s> The HP M7248 has a better duel core processor, a tv tuner, and graphics card which are all $200+ upgrades if you got the HP A1250. </s>
<s> The HP M7248 is also at a better value. </s>
<s> If you can live without the latest and the greatest, then the A1250 will suit you just fine and can handle all the chores you throw at it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
