the device manuals arent exactly manuals but two A6 pieces of folded paper ,and not much help they give you a 3cbsi.com link to goto for support(buggers even folded it so you cant use it straight out of the pack as toilet paper) , not registered with anyone , so i dont think ive got support, is it worth it?
i found some good online pages even some with screen shots of the web interface and tutorials on how to do certain things.
portforwarding.com was 1 , but not yet come accross anything that deals with event logging posting on here i was hoping someone may have the same router and might know how to do it .
