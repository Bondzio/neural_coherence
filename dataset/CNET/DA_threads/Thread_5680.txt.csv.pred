1.1.1	i purchased a hp monochrome laser printer and would like to connect it to my airport network.	St
1.1.2	at hp's website they show a bluetooth device which plugs into the printer's usb port.	St
1.1.3	my question is will this device work with my airport network?	St
1.2.1	Given no model number I can't check if a wifi print server would work but bluetooth is something of a non-starter for many reasons.	St
1.2.2	The number one reason is either it doesn't connect to wifi and the other being the 5 or more minute page printing time.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I set one of these up on a mobile cart in a school and it worked fine.	St
1.3.2	Bluetooth is a horse of another color and works only with other compatible hardware.	St
1.3.3	The HP wireless device was bit pricey, as I recall, but it worked.	St
1.3.4	Others cost less and might work as well.	St
