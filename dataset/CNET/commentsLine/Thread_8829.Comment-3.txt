absolutely you are write.
unfortunately when entering the post i followed the auto-prompt for another problem i experienced some way back.
in fact the title should be the one i have now inserted above.
i'm not sure how to rectify this within the forum?
can i change my post title?
my troubles are being compounded by my own stupidity.
