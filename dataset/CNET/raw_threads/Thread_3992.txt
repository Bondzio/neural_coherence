It runs all the games you mentioned well, but not the most recent FPS games.

Your PC should handle a high end medium AGP card without a problem. I suggest a Nvidia card as that is currently on your PC and should not be a problem with installation. Some people have had problems replacing a Nvidia Card with an ATI card, especially with drivers. I suggest the XFX Nvidia Geforce FX 5700 Ultra that Newegg has for $175, or the FX 5900XT for $175/185. You will definitely be able to play Unreal, GTA, Need for Speed, Battlefield, and should be able to play Doom 3, and Half-Life-2 at 800x600 pixels or possibly at 1024x768. If you do go with the Radeon 9600, I suggest the Pro or XT version which would also be in your price range.
16	4	93558	1062209	1058043	ozos	3/21/05 10:34 PM	1.11144444E12	are you just hell bent on wasting $$$?	ok john i ask you WHY DO YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY? i would say DO NOT BUY THE 5700 Ultra (you cannot find them new at newegg) or the 5900XT (all out of stock) for a few reasons: A) the 9600XT is $126 and performs like the 5700U B) a 6600GT AGP is $194, and will outperform a 9800XT or 5950U C) the 5900XT and 5700U are physically huge cards, while the 9600XT and 6600GT are smaller (i've seen the 9600Pro, which is roughly the same as the XT version, held a 6600GT, own a 5900XT, and seen comparison pics with a 5700U) alright as for the driver thing it isn't hard you go into control panel select add-remove software remove the drivers from there then, if you want to be extra safe, use driver cleaner (Which is free) you have to tell Windows to not install it's own device drivers for the gfx card your removing then you shut down pull out your nVidia install your ATI boot up Windows will hunt for drivers you put in the CD and your good to go if your using something like Win98SE it's probably easier as it probably won't try to force it's own drivers on the card
16	5	93558	1062277	1062209	John Robie	3/22/05 12:12 AM	1.11145032E12	No, just the opposite.....	Re: A) the 9600XT is $126 and performs like the 5700U SO WHAT? B) a 6600GT AGP is $194, and will outperform a 9800XT or 5950U I have suggest the 6600GT AGP to others before and intend to get one before long myself. However, pay attention ozos, Guy said &quot;..no more than $175&quot; so I didn't suggest the $194 6600GT . C) the 5900XT and 5700U are physically huge cards, while the 9600XT and 6600GT are smaller (i've seen the 9600Pro, which is roughly the same as the XT version, held a 6600GT, own a 5900XT, and seen comparison pics with a 5700U) Yes I am very conservative. You seem to be bent all out of hell in some of your posts.
16	6	93558	1062302	1062277	John Robie	3/22/05 1:08 AM	1.11145368E12	Also......	The GeForce 5700 Ultra out performs the Radeon 9600XT. See Tom's Hardware: http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20041004/vga_charts-06.html http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20041004/vga_charts-07.html The 5700 Ultra and GeForce 5900XT are popular cards and a person can be put on Neweggs email auto alert for when they are restocked.
16	7	93558	1062304	1062277	ozos	3/22/05 1:09 AM	1.11145374E12	um	you still aren't seeing this he is trying to save money $175 when you can do it for $126? and $175 to get 1/4th the power of $194 i'm sure he can find $19 to get a nearly 4x performance increase
16	8	93558	1062310	1062304	John Robie	3/22/05 1:13 AM	1.11145398E12	Sorry young feller..	Read my post above, the 5700Ultra outperforms the 9600XT.
16	9	93558	1062317	1062310	ozos	3/22/05 1:27 AM	1.11145482E12	want it dis-proven?	anyways i've been looking to buy a 5700U since last fall and Newegg still hasn't stocked them and if your saying a sub 200 point beating in 3D03 is sufficent you've obviously never seen image quality benchmarks look up VGA Charts III when THG did image quality with UT2k3 the 9600XT kills the 5700U remeber it's R3xx vs NV3x the R3xx performs better with AA/AF (compared to the NV3x with the same levels of AA/AF) also you don't say beaten unless the gap is around 1200 points in 3D03 anything less and it's just squabbling and i don't think anyone is stupid enough to pay an extra $50, for a card that they probably can't find, for a 200 point increase when 9600XT's are readily avliable and if you really wanna get snappy with me the 9600XT beats the 5700 Ultra in: Aquamark 3 (31150 vs 30683) Unreal Tournament 2004 - 1024x768 FarCry - 1024x768 (26.2 FPS vs 10.9) FarCry - 1024x768 w/ 4xAA/AF Flight Simulator 2004 - 1024x768 Flight Simulator 2004 - 1024x768 AA/AF (tied at 22.1FPS) Joint Operations - 1024x768 Battlefield Vietnam - 1024x768 (by .8FPS, yet i'm including this just to show you how minimal the difference is) (DTM) Race Driver 2 - 1024x768 and again in Race Driver with 8xAF it won 50%-ish of the benchmarks and keeps all the other games playable saves him $50 hmmm let's see a 1-5 FPS difference vs. Wasting $50 on a card that is discontinued hmmm that's a toughie john it really really is i think i might need to...oh wait OF COURSE THE 9600XT IS A BETTER OPTION! god! their equivalent cards except that the GeForce FX will win in UT2k4 and Doom III, while the Radeon will win in HL2, and AA/AF benchmarks they run at nearly the same core clock, and the only thing that seperates them on paper (Aside from core design/revision) is 25MHZ of core clock, and 400MHZ of RAM clock and if you really wanna get stupid over it the 9600XT is faster in terms of raw MHZ (this is just to show how stupid your come back is) you can't honestly gripe over something like that and you also should consider that the 5900XT and 5700 Ultra, while good cards back in Summer '04, are horrible options now the 6600nU can be had for $160 for AGP and it's 5900U levels of power or better does not require as much electrical power as the 5900XT is a smaller card is easily found from multiple vendors hell for an extra $3 you can get the MSI version that comes with VIVO

16	11	93558	1062683	1062364	dagger906	3/22/05 7:45 AM	1.1114775E12	What's going on?	Just get a Radeon 9200SE. It's under $40, and can run all the games you specified smoothly. You don't need any of the expensive cards they mentioned. Btw, Geforce FX 5900 has a huge fan that takes 2 slots. My friend has it. It sounds like a vacuum cleaner going off in his computer case every time he starts a game... o_O
16	12	93558	1062804	1062683	John Robie	3/22/05 8:35 AM	1.1114805E12	Re: What's going on.	Hi Dagger, Guy wanted a card at first for no more than $90, then for no more than $175. I suggest the FX 5700 Ultra that Newegg has for $175, or the FX 5900XT for $175/185. And if he went with Radeon 9600, I suggest the Pro or XT version which would also be in his price range. The FX 5700 Ultra outperforms the Radeon 9600XT according to tests performed by Tom's Hardware, and I would not call their test wrong with the expensive equipment and care they use in testing. Guy could select a card from $90 to $175 and even get a TI4600 to play the latest games...don't know about the future. I get insulted, &quot;are you just hell bent on wasting $$$&quot; for suggesting a $175 card, the max Guy is willing to pay, or a Radeon 9600 in which I also suggested he go with the Pro or XT version. I have a Nvidia GeForce 4 TI4600 on a 2.0GHz with 500MB RAM that I can't find a CD game it won't play. It plays Doom3 and Half-Life 2 very well without any studder, hesitation, crash, and with a good color picture. Sure he could go with $50 FX 5200, or a 5500, 5700SE or even with a TI4600, or Radeon 9200, or 9600, and play some pretty good games.
16	13	93558	1062826	1062804	John Robie	3/22/05 8:41 AM	1.11148086E12	PS...	My brother has a Nvidia GeForce 5500 with his Dell 2.8Ghz, 500MB RAM, and he claims to play all the latest high tech CD games without problems.
16	14	93558	1063306	1062804	ozos	3/22/05 12:35 PM	1.1114949E12	ok...	alright the reason your 4600 does so well is because (excluding it's lack of DirectX 9 support) it's on par with a 5700 series card and the 5700 Ultra does outperform the 9600XT on some fronts i'm just suggesting the 9600XT from a value perspective
16	15	93558	1063343	1062826	ozos	3/22/05 12:51 PM	1.11149586E12	i'd buy that	i'd buy that to a point that is when i used to have my 5200 (waaaaaaaaay way back in the day) it would run UT2k4 with no issues, yet Halo would slow it down and btw only the 5900nU and Ultra have large fans the card your probably thinking of is the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra which is also called dustbuster the FX 5950 Ultra has an OTES solution, but afaik it's not loud (i've been near 5950U equipped machines, no high pitch whine that i've heard) the FX 5900 Ultra isn't a horribly loud card, but it does take up 2 slots for it's large HS some 5900 Ultra's and 1 or 2 5950 Ultra's actually came with single slot cooling solutions (i personally would not stick a PCI card right underneath any video card from the high performance spectrum, mainly because it's going to be very warm right there (and i don't know of anyone who runs more than maybe 2 PCI devices))
16	16	93558	1088460	1062683	lurker78	3/31/05 7:39 PM	1.11229794E12	Does That Come in a PCI version?	Is there a PCI version of that I could buy? I'm looking to upgrade but my AGP is integrated to my motherboard.
16	17	93558	1088483	1088460	damasta55r	3/31/05 7:54 PM	1.11229884E12	???	What does AGP is integrated to my motherboard mean? All AGP ports are integrated into the motherboard, i don't know how you can get it in any other way. Yes the ATI 9200 does come in PCI, but also in AGP. Roger
16	18	93558	1093845	1088483	lurker78	4/2/05 12:22 PM	1.11244452E12	Sorry	Sorry I failed to make this clearer. I have what is called &quot;integerated&quot; graphics, where the GPU is built onto the motherboard instead of on a removable AGP card. In short, I can disable my AGP set, but I can never remove or upgrade it.
16	19	93558	1093923	1093845	damasta55r	4/2/05 12:56 PM	1.11244656E12	You mean	you can disble the integrated graphics, which i think you mean is based on an AGP card. However, do you have a PCI or an AGP, if you have an AGP, get an AGP graphics card, if you have PCI, get a PCI card. DO NOT DISABLE THE drivers for the AGP slot on the motherboard, but do disable integrated graphics when upgrading your graphics card. Roger

16	21	93558	1097057	1094176	ozos	4/3/05 9:51 PM	1.11256506E12	yeah he was confused	he didn't get what you meant your gfx aren't using the AGP slot/channel (afaik) but they are considered AGP graphics for PCI the best you can do is the PCI Geforce FX 5700LE found at www.newegg.com just go into video cards and select PCI as the interface it should cost around $87
16	22	93558	1098160	1057657	AuBrEy Online	4/4/05 10:43 AM	1.11261138E12	Umm..... Does he really need a high spec card?	Why not try a Nvidia 5200?.... or something cheaper?..... he said about playing GTA and other games I'm assuming he's looking at GTA 3 witch anit that much heat. I think it's best to drop down to a card with a budget of $80 maybe other money could be spent on a newer CPU?.... not sure give me your feedback!

16	24	93558	1098307	1098160	John Robie	4/4/05 11:47 AM	1.11261522E12	High spec card...	A $42.95 Nvidia GeForce FX5200 128MB AGP card will play all the games he mentioned plus... He wanted at first a card up to $90, then immediately changed his mind and wanted a card up to $175, so he did not want a inexpensive card. Poster 'Guy' made his two posts right up front and never came back to CNet?
