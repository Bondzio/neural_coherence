I just measured the top of my repurposed wooden TV cart/printer stand, and it's about 15&quot;x26&quot; - a great fit for my current Samsung ML-2510 laser printer, but not quite deep enough for a Brother MFC-5890CN like the one that volvogirl &amp; her spouse own.
At least now I have a upper limit to look for with the dimensions of a replacement printer or multifunction machine!
