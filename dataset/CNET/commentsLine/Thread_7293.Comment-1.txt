hi there.
at work we have 2 desktops running windows nt not the fastest machines in the world but they are being replaced shortly.
anyways the problem is we cannot get an lcd to work on either of them.
they both have matrox dual head display graphics cards and work perfectly with crt monitors.
when you connect a flat screen to them there is no signal at all.
is there a setting in bios that needs to be changed or is it cos the systems are so old?
to be honest i'd rather not touch the bios and settings like that cos like i say they are work pc's and if i bugger it up i'll have me nuts chewed off.
just thought this was a bit weird as i have never seen this problem before in all my years of computing ?
cheers
