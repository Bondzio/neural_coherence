<s> I need to find a BelAir20E user guide. </s>
<s> Also BelAir100C. </s>
<s> If Ericson has no such manual on hand and won't answer your questions it's best to move forward with your plans to replace the gear. </s>
<s> Yes I see some items with a google search but if you post in a forum it means that that was not what you are looking for. </s>
<s> It would be a shame to search for an user manual if the question was generic such as &quot;can I add or replace the antenna?&quot; Bob </s>
<s> but will not release to grey market. </s>
<s> You have to buy from a distributor or direct to get any user guides. </s>
<s> Thanks for clearing that up. </s>
<s> So you're encountering folk that feel that manuals should be available and possibly free. </s>
<s> These clients have been tough to handle at times but I tend to nod a lot and if they won't pay for the manuals for the task at hand I thank them for their time and consideration and hope they call again. </s>
<s> I didn't offer any manual since you could find them with google if they are out there. </s>
<s> But makers do own them so they can control how they are disseminated. </s>
<s> Are you seeing folk that think that such is tantamount to highway robbery? </s>
