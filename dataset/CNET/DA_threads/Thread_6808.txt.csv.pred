1.1.1	Hello, I have been looking for quite a while for a fairly high end grahics card plus a tv tuner that is for a PCI-Express machine.	St
1.1.2	I know there at some out there such as ATI All-in-Wonder X1800, but I am really looking for a tv in, as well as a tv out, so i cant hook it up to my tv while recording tv, or play doom III on the tv as well.	St
1.1.3	Does such a product exist, or do i have to break up my grahics card and tv turner to get the tv out feature?	St
1.1.4	Thanks Matt	Polite
1.2.1	http://www.ati.com/products/radeonx1900/aiwx1900/specs.html it features: - tv in and tv out - tv recording - tv as second monitor a regular tv tuner card is an input only device.	St
1.2.2	but most all modern graphics cards that support dual monitors have tv out capability.	St
1.3.1	do you know if XL1800 does the same thing as the XL1900?	St
1.3.2	If so, what the major deference it features	St
1.4.1	xl1800 and xl1900 are not ati a-i-w model numbers.	St
1.4.2	here's what available in the a-i-w lineup.	St
1.4.3	all will have more/less the same video/tv features.	St
1.4.4	the differences will be with the graphics processors.	St
1.4.5	+ x1900 a-i-w is the top of the line and great for gaming ($450) + x1800xl a-i-w is last year's model and good at gaming ($350) + x800xl a-i-w is older tech but is still a good midrange gamer ($300) + a-i-w 2006 edition is the current product but with a very low end graphics chip (x1300).	St
1.4.6	it's not really suitable for gaming imho.	St
1.4.7	($180)	St
1.5.1	Hey, thanks alot for the information, it def helped	Polite
