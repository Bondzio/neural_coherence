<s> My computer works just fine in all ways, save one. </s>
<s> It does not restart! </s>
<s> It boots up just fine from a power-off situation, but if you try to restart it, it always gets hung up (or something like that, I guess...no signal gets sent to the monitor which shuts down, but the lights on the computer case remain on). </s>
<s> In order to reboot, you need to power it off, then turn it back on. </s>
<s> This happens every time, and has since I got the machine a few months ago. </s>
<s> I've not really cared much, since it always powers up just fine and I have no other problems with the computer or OS. </s>
<s> But it is annoying, that I can't just restart normally and need to power down and then power up again. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
