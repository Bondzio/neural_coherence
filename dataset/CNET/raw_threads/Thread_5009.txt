But I'm still on my laptop. Go figure. Bob

Proffitt	6/14/13 9:13 AM	1.37120118E12	The problem is now	The tablet with the lowest lag will not be one we can discuss as even if I noted it here, it would be out of date by tomorrow. The top 10 are all nice and I have one of those in the 10 and another model of another in the 10. Why not one of the top 10 models? Bob PS. Correction. I don't own these. The office is porting apps so I get to use them a lot.
