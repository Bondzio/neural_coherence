if you are going to use a windows xp os, i would make sure all parts used are xp compatible.
i would also try to use all &quot;retail&quot; listed parts and no &quot;oem&quot; parts, the retail parts may cost more, but you should not have other compatiblity problems, such as with the motherboard which can cause crashes or lockups.
one other point is with most higher end new motherboards, both intel and amd types, you will need a atx type power supply, most will need to be a version 2.0. this type of power supply will have a 24 pin main power plug or a adapter and will also have a seprate 12+ power plug for the processor (important).
most power supply pre-installed in new cases do not have this type of supply.
keeping the case cool is another issue, both new processors (intel or amd) need to operate below 100f or 38c, so extra fans maybe needed.
i just purchased all the parts needed to build a new system.
i ended up spending around $980.00 with shipping for a intel 915 asus brand motherboard with a lga 775 intel 3.2 processor, case w/temp display, atx 2.0-485 watt power supply, asus dual layer burner dvd, asus pci-16x express 128mb video card, corsair ddr dual channel 3200 - 1gb memory w/heatspeaders and a seagate barracuda sata 80gb hard drive.
i looked at over 15 different vendors and ended up using 3 to purchase the needed parts.
&quot; for the barebone parts &quot; for the memory &quot; for the video card i believe after buying 2 computers pre-built by companies in the past, that the better way to go is to build your own system, at least you know what you are getting.
it just takes some homework and alot of looking for a good price.
goodluck....
