Did this new mobo come with a cd?
If so and with a little luck if you place it in your cd reader unit it will auto play and present you with a nice menu to load the mobo drivers.
If you can do that then many if not all of those exclamation marks will go away.
Be aware that the drivers on the cd may be quite old so a trip to the mobo makers site to check for updates would be a good thing to do.
