Hey: As some of you might remember, I just purchased a new DVD burner so I could start to make back ups of my files. My machine already has a CD reader/player ONLY installed, so the DVD I got is an external unit. Now being as ignorant of some technology as I am, I asked the salesguy alot of questions. Basically to prove to him I was as ignorant as I stated. I asked what the different X's meant, what this word meant, ect. I also assumed certain things, but know all to well what ASSUME stands for, so I even asked those questions. I guess I didn't go deep enough. I had assumed that the DVD hooked up to the computer via a USB port or a card slot that needed to be installed. I asked which it was, & was told that hook up was simple thru a USB port. The unit even came with needed cables. COOL! I took it home. It's been sitting on the kitchen table ever since. I carefully read ALL the papers that came with it, twice even. It seemed an easy enough job to do. Ain't Plug & Play just WONDERFUL! Anywho, tonight was/is &quot;Kid's Eat Free Night&quot; at the local Denny's. They also have activities for the kid's to do before, during, & after they eat. So, I figured we'd go there, & I'd tackle the install when we came home, after feeding the dogs. That's when I noticed it. On the box of the DVD, it stated &quot;EASY INSTALL&quot; thru a USB 2.0 port. The machine the DVD's getting hooked up to is a Dell 4400. It has 4 USB ports, 2 front, 2 rear. They are USB 1's I assume, since I had never heard about USB 2's when I got it. As a matter of fact, today was the 1st time I had ever heard of USB 2's, while going thru THIS forum. That was before I even knew I had made this mistake. From what I read about USB 2's, they are about 40X's faster than regular USB's. Also, ya can't Mix N' Match em. I don't know, but the plugs look the same to me. So now I'm sitting here with this DVD that I can't use, yet. My question is this, &quot;What do I do to correct this problem?&quot; Are there any type of adapters out there? Also, I have another question. What is different between the terms &quot;BURN&quot; & &quot;RIP&quot;? A BIG THANKS IN ADVANCE!

That way you have 2.0 and 1.0. The USB 1 and USB 2 plugs are identical. USB 1 is 12Mb/s USB 2 is 480Mb/s When you bought the 4400 USB 2 was not available, so it wasn't your error.

Check it out on tne web, get a reality check and don't over pay to hurry it up. What's COMPUsa want, problem with them, I have seen them charge $26 for a USB cable that was $7, same Brand and model at a store down the street. You can get ripped off big time on small things if you are not willing to order and wait a few days.

11225	8	53839	644111	644057	Ugg	12/29/04 9:22 PM	1.10435532E12	Yeah, I Know.	JMarchi: Thanks. I used the Circuit City/CDW, experence as an example to my son about shopping. Showed him that because I was in a hurry and didn't fully research my purchase, I coulda ended up giving Circuit City an extra $60. Luckily, I did get a good/alright deal on the DVD. I gulped when I was at CDW & asked about what they had. Fortunately, I did a quick search before I went to get the card & saw that the average price for a 2 holer was about $20/25. I also saw that CDW had a 6 holer on sale for $45., so when the guy at Circuit City said they were out of 2 holers but had a 5 holer for $70., I said forget that & went to CDW. Got the 4 holer for $12. (It almost sounds like we're talking about outhouses ;))Thanks.

I still haven't figured out why you got an external unit for a lot more money and more headaches than an internal unit. Anyway, good luck. chuck

11225	11	53839	650950	645338	Ugg	1/1/05 11:08 PM	1.10462088E12	Because.	chuckieu: I've already got a CD Rom installed, & it was suggested that if I got an external I'd be able to do disk to disk burns. I do have another bay to install another whatever in, but I really don't feel like messing around with this Dell, as it has been such a pleasure since day 1. Ooops, a lightning bolt almost got me. I'm looking forwards to the day when we get another HD for it & turning this one into a slave. Darned bolt almost got me again!
