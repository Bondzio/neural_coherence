<s> I was given a HP Pavilion that has the network card on the mb. </s>
<s> I replaced the card with a Netgear FA 311 PCI adapter when the original decided it had worked long enough. </s>
<s> However, I can't get the computer to recognize the new card. </s>
<s> I have tried uninstalling and disabling the old card but I get a &quot;Code 10&quot; error message - whatever that means. </s>
<s> Do I need to get into the bios to change stuff and if so how do I do that? </s>
<s> I have Windows XP but I don't know the model number of the computer; it's not anywhere on the case. </s>
<s> HP support told me to contact Netgear and Netgear doesn't seem to know what I'm talking about. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help; the kids are driving me nuts with only one computer connected to the Web. </s>
<s> (Talk about spoiled! </s>
<s> When I was a kid computers were made out of rocks and you had to use your feet to stop the car.) </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> What you didn't write in your post is if you installed a driver for said card. </s>
<s> A clue is this user's review: &quot;Easier install driver than the Netgear 311 but..., Netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 (they send me the 311 driver disk). </s>
<s> I figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption. </s>
<s> After wasting sometime with the wrong driver I got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there. </s>
<s> It works very well.. </s>
<s> I just wish Netgear was a little more careful&quot; They had some 311's too and noted difficulty with the driver install. </s>
<s> In closing, I think something fishy is going on here and I'd just get another card. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Look over http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_dnld.asp?prodNum=FA311 and if you download documentation and files, the latest date I see is 2001. </s>
<s> This is years before Windows XP, so it may be just a bum card? </s>
<s> Try another make/model. </s>
<s> Or at least another slot... Bob Bob </s>
<s> If you haven't already go to HP's web site, go to the knowledgebase and do a search on the &quot;Code 10&quot; error message. </s>
<s> Try pressing the Delete or ctrl or f10 key during the power-on, but before windows starts to load, that should get you into the bios. </s>
<s> Good Luck Ciao. </s>
