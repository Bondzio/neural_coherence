<s> I have 2 XP machines running SP1. </s>
<s> Yesterday they were working fine. </s>
<s> I could connect from either direction. </s>
<s> Today if i try to connect to computer A from computer B i get the network path was not found error. </s>
<s> I have not ran any updates nor do i have a firewall. </s>
<s> Permissions are setup just fine on each computer. </s>
<s> I can connect to Computer B from computer A just fine. </s>
<s> I have internet connnection and everything seems to be working fine. </s>
<s> I am connected with an eight port switch. </s>
<s> I have been working fine for several months now and i just don't know what could have caused this. </s>
<s> ANY IDEAS? </s>
<s> There are a few that connected a cable/dsl modem to a hub/switch and it might work for a short time. </s>
<s> Then the ISP knocks out the IP address and such may happen. </s>
<s> Your description of the network is too light to really tell what it is yet. </s>
<s> Do open a command window and try ... NET VIEW Bob </s>
<s> I do have a cable modem and i use an eight port switch. </s>
<s> Both of the computers will connect to the internet and i can see each computer from command Net View. </s>
<s> The standard setup is... Cable modem -&gt; Router -&gt; switch and machines. </s>
<s> You can grouse all you want it worked before... Bob </s>
<s> That's exactly the way it is setup. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't specify the first time. </s>
<s> Cable modem&gt;Router&gt;Switch </s>
<s> And its working. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since I cannot get an answer from you I am now going somewhere else! </s>
<s> Hurray for Bob </s>
<s> You have to supply details and even the correct details for help forums to help you. </s>
<s> All you need to do is read your posts and see that the first post supplied &quot;not much&quot;, the second post had an error and the last post is one where you give up rather than tell what firewall you have installed. </s>
<s> I hope the last clue was enough for you to reconfigure the firewall which I still don't know if you have such. </s>
<s> The Forum Tip helps avoid such back and forth as we dig out the needed information: Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. </s>
<s> Best of luck in your endeavours. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> people assume that troubleshooters know users' network configurations and desktop configurations. </s>
<s> there are multiple ways you can setup a local area network and access the internet. </s>
<s> if you go to a doctor, he is going to ask you all kinds of questions about what ails you. </s>
<s> troubleshooters aren't any different. </s>
<s> we ask many question and the more details you can provide about your network, hardware and software configuration, the better and quicker we can help people. </s>
<s> also as you might have gathered from reading the various posts, no two troubleshooters are going to prescribe the same remedy. </s>
<s> some like to get into the programing side to fix things while others prefer to reinstall the whole shebang to fix it. </s>
<s> i belong in the latter group. </s>
<s> after a diagnose, i've learned to substitute a suspected hardware with one that i know works. </s>
<s> if it's a setup problem, tear it down to its simple components and then work your way up. </s>
<s> so if we're trying to help you and we seem to be asking questions that you think might not be pertinent to your case, i beg you to be patient. </s>
<s> our work is doubly hard because we can't physically see your setup and most of us who work with networks are hands-on kind of people. </s>
<s> anyway, don't give up too easily </s>
<s> let's talk about your network setup for a second. </s>
<s> you have 2 computers and those two are connected to a switch and the switch is connected to a router. </s>
<s> is this a single network or do you have other things connected to the router? </s>
<s> i'm assuming your're using a switch bec there aren't enough ports on the router. </s>
<s> otherwise, if i were you, i would just get rid of the switch and connect both computer to the router (kiss). </s>
<s> also are the two computers hardwire or wireless? </s>
