Hi all.
I have an Arris router/modem combo unit which is terrible.
I've done a lot of research with respect to its performance for Xbox Live.
I have an Xbox Live account but my console simply cannot connect.
Even fiddling with WPA/WPA2, etc doesn't do the trick.
A lot of other people have this problem with this Arris unit.
My question is, how do I make a D-Link Wireless N router as the gateway, leaving the Arris ONLY as the modem?
Thanks!
