my wife has a macbook and i have an imac.
the macbook is nice and portable, but i do a lot of multi-media stuff: movie editing, music, graphics work, etc.
i find working with an imac is much easier for doing this stuff.
the macbook, with a small screen and scrunched keyboard is too small.
also, the imac has more firewire, usb, audio-in, audio-out, speaker plug, etc.
that makes it much easier to plug external equipment in and also run my imac speakers, all in a neat package.
but, the macbook is portable, and i can download movies and music and take it with me.
i just like the space and the &quot;open&quot; work environment that the imac gives me.
