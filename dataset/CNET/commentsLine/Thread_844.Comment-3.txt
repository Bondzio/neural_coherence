it's for artists.
the usual art person wants this so they can get some effect as they draw.
the artists i know have never gone for a tablet or laptop with the wacom.
they set up the drawing on the cintiq device.
i am however running into new artists that seem to get upset as you discuss this area.
a few have burst into flames.
