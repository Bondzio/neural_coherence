After years with both, Plextor feels no different and in fact I feel like I overpaid for such.
Now I just pick out the cheap unit, place it in the rack with airspace top/bottom and good cooling.
Never lost an unit that wasn't 4 years old.
Roxio bolloxes up the system too much for me, so I prefer Nero and more often than not I use CDBurnerXP since it gets the job done without complaining it didn't come with the drive.
