thanks for you help, yeah i tried that link but nothings changed.
I haven't installed anything new software or such as of the time it was working to now, the only thing really new is the new 22&quot; LCD.
I'm thinking though the DVD drive has croaked as my computer is free of virus's, trojans, infections and tried a lens cleaner multiple times.
Is there anyway i can test the laser of the DVD drive?
