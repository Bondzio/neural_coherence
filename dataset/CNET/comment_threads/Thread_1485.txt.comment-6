I had the same problem, but I discovered that it was my Norton Internet Sercurity, that was blocking the the new Vista computer from seeing the XP machine.
I made the XP computer a &quot;trusted&quot; computer, and it popped up in the network.
I don't know if that's our issue, but it seemed to work for me.
Make sure your firewall (Windows or other) allows the IP address of the computer through.
