It has a very nice price tag. Has anyone heard of or have any feedback about INOi external HD's? I want to take the digital music off my PC HD and put it on the external HD (the INOi). I'm not too sure that I'll stick with using Win OS. Suffice it to say this long time Win OS user might be posting in the Mac forum... So, I don't want to invest too much money into something I may not be using anymore. At this time the best cost effective solution seems to be external HD with CD/DVD RW burner combo that is Mac compatible. I like the fact that I have the option of writing to a DVD RW or CD rw.... I've been told the best back up option for digital music is burn it to a DVD/CD RW disk is that true?

Even moreso when you have 2 backups you carried away. When stored and handled proper, you'll get many years of safe backup from your media. One simple suggestion. Simple backup tends to work best. That is, if I erase a DVDRW, then write files to it with simple CD/DVD recording software in a closed session without &quot;backup software&quot;, then the disk and files are readable across many machines, OS and platforms.
