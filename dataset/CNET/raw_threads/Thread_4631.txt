I don't know if this relates to quality standards that are relaxed in these or not. But, a drive that breaks and goes to the dump earlier than one that does not, loses some &quot;green&quot; appeal...or so I'd think. It takes energy to make the drive as well. It's only &quot;greener&quot; if the overall consumption of energy from manufacturing to disposal is less than one without that label. But earlier disposal can mean additional environmental impact and this makes it's &quot;greenness&quot; difficult to qualify.
