Sorry if I misunderstood your question but multi-touch support is in the new Visual Studio 2010 and apps you write (hence custom) there. You may have to get such things created since your off the shelf apps are going to be WIMP (windows icon mouse pointer) based for a reason. Bob

You can download it from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=b152fadd-82e4-4ddb-a46a-aebe49944428&displaylang=en I heard that corel has release media player and image editor but I have not tried them. Recently I got a editor called StNotepad Touch, which has gestures for copy, paste, cut, enter, space, delete, backspace, undo etc... Download it from http://stforms.net/stnotepad-touch/download I saw a media player also in the above website, which has cool gestures for media player, but it's a very simple player, no advanced features. Inform me, if you find any new softwares.
