<s> Well, after 7 years my Dell Dimension 4300 HD finally up and died on me. </s>
<s> Even though this computer was old and slow, it was perfect for some functions I needed to conduct. </s>
<s> I have several laptops for serious processing power. </s>
<s> I want to resurrect this box and I was wondering what I could buy to replace the dead HD. </s>
<s> It was a 40G IDE drive. </s>
<s> Any suggestions are appreciated. </s>
<s> While I could safely write any 120GB drive of the old IDE interface will do, small details such as the version of the BIOS, the exact version of your XP CD (?) </s>
<s> will be needed if you want to go past 120GB. </s>
<s> but don't know for how much longer. </s>
<s> I wouldn't try to go larger though. </s>
<s> Seagate and WD's should be fine and run under 40 bucks web priced. </s>
<s> For what I use this computer for increasing HD to 80G is fine, it doubles the size of the original HD. </s>
<s> I figure I will spend some $$$ to attempt to get some of the data transferred. </s>
<s> Do you have a recommendation on manufacturer, model, etc? </s>
<s> Here in the US I paid 60 bucks for a refurb 750GB SATA hard disk. </s>
<s> Surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg.com or geeks.com As to paying for transfer of the data, why would I do that when I have a cable like http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020&cat=HDD and free cloning software like G4U? </s>
<s> Sorry but this is an area I feel you DIY or pay up. </s>

<s> I am located in the US as well, so finding a drive I think is a rather easy feat. </s>
<s> The question had more to do with I did not know what I could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations (size, type, manufacturer, etc.) </s>
<s> Can I replace an IDE drive with a SATA? </s>
<s> As for transferring the data, if the original drive worked, then I would have no problem in transferring data myself. </s>
<s> So, I figure if the data is recoverable, then I will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred. </s>
<s> Thank you to everyone who has replied thus far. </s>
<s> It has been very helpful. </s>
<s> Find a drive that fits your need (or case, etc.) </s>
<s> Look at the user feedback. </s>
<s> For the most part the ones that write &quot;I couldn't make it work&quot; are the ones to avoid. </s>
<s> -&gt; In closing, currently the hard disk makers are just like getting gas from Texaco, BP or Hess. </s>
<s> Maybe there is someone that can write a convincing treatise on why one is preferred over the other. </s>
