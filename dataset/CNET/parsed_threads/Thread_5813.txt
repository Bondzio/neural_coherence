<s> I was running Windows XP with SP1 and my computer shut down in about 30 seconds.I installed SP2 and now it takes close to 7 minutes.Its very annoying.I read about turning off programs in the sys.tray,but i'm not sure which ones to turn off.Any help would be appreciated,but please don't make it too technical. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> any warning - or message at all ? </s>
<s> No warnings or messages at all. </s>
<s> How about a hardware inventory? </s>
<s> Include the power supply wattage, fan RPMs, how many bulging, leaking capacitors. </s>
<s> In other words, be complete. </s>

<s> There could be a number of reasons for this that I know about, and probably a bunch that I don't. </s>
<s> The first thing to check is the &quot;quick shutdown&quot; feature of Windows. </s>
<s> Use the start menu to access the windows help screen...then search for the feature to learn how to turn it on and off. </s>
<s> Also, check the services you have running. </s>
<s> If you are not familiar with windows services (via Control Panel / Administrative Tools /) ....and you have &quot;always on&quot; broadband connection.....try disconnecting the broadband cable, rebooting, then shut down to see if your computer shuts donwn any quicker. </s>
<s> If it IS quicker, then SP2 may be running a bunch of background services that you don't really need, OR, a particular service is not responding to the new configuration provided by SP2. </s>
<s> Just a few ideas to try, in case you haven't sloved it by now. </s>
<s> Even if you have to suffer a longer shutdown..SP2 is worth the extra shutdown time because your security is GREATLY improved. </s>
<s> I really didn't have to do anything. </s>
<s> It fixed itself,Don't ask me how or why. </s>
<s> I think it has a mind of its own. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
