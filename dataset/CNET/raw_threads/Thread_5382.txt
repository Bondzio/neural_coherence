I did lend my HDD to a friend and after that I can't access my files, every time I connect it to my PC it ask me to format and I can't access the files. after try on few PC's with couple USB 3.0 cables another friend did connect it to his Mac and it could read all the files. I don't know if the first guy to borrow it did connect it to a Mac or PC. Any one saw it happen before ? Thanks a lot, cheers
