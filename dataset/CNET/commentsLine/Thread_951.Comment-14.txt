not only can you partition your new drive, but i recommend that you do partition it.
you may make some partitions ntfs and others fat32.
if you are using something like symantec's ghost to make images of your other machines, then i would suggest a fat32 partition for each machine.
remember that if a system fails, and this is an external drive, you will need some way of booting the system with access to this external drive.
you will also need the software to restore the original drive.
when partitioning the new drive, using gdisk (also from symantec) is much more friendly than fdisk.
