(sidebar: they also complain there are some games (online) that don't work great on their pc either - but i think that might be more net nanny than their connection. and i don't even think the net nanny does any good so i may nix that too b/c of the cost/benefit i am seeing.) thanks for any thoughts on this.

Like a better antenna can help like http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=700-0000367&cat=NET But you left out make/model details of all the wifi hardware so I can't tell if you could use these. It's also noteworthy that some are finding moving to WPA helps. Why? Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=242736&messageID=2457489 Changing RF channels helps. Bob
