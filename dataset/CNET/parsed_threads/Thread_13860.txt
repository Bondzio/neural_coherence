<s> Just go done building a new computer and i go to hook my computer up to my tv like i always do so i can watch movies and i hook it up to the dvi port on my 9800 gt and attach the dvi to hdmi adapter on to the dvi port and plug it up to my tv through my hdmi cord and it looks like ****! </s>

<s> i know that its not going to look as good on the tv due to the pixel depth but thats not my problem its just that its off the screen,Just said that to not cause confusion. </s>

<s> If the HDCP can't be verified (sorry, I hope you will google what new terms are as I won't duplicate that here) then the display should fall back to SDTV resolution or &quot;480p.&quot; The fix is to connect with VGA and forget HDMI. </s>
<s> You could get a video card with HDMI output that is certified to output HDCP compliante HDMI but my bet is that would run a bit more cash and involve the Vista OS. </s>
