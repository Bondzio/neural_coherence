<s> Hi, How to get the details of an android phone connected to the wifi network.Even I know the IP of the device as we can see it from the phone it self how to fetch some information about the phone like its os version (2.2.x Froyo,2.3.x Gingerbread etc ),Model of phone etc. </s>
<s> My aim is to identify an android when IP is given to me.I got some tool like Quote: nmap ,but it is not showing a full details of phone by which I can recognise it is as an android phone,is there any other tool or mechanism to identify the phone if the IP is given. </s>

<s> I got something like &quot;vendor class &quot; of the dhcp protocol stack ,but how to read this data .Kindly tell me some idea about this. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.stanford.edu/services/lnaguide/dhcp-log-explanation.html and many other things tell us that DHCP does not do this. </s>
