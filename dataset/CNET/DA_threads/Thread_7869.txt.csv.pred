1.1.1	Hi Everybody , Specs : computer model number : hp pavillion ze4610us OS : Win XP Home Edition Router : Linksys wireless-G 2.4 Ghz Model : WRT54G I purchased Linksys router in order to network my desktop PC and my laptop to be on the internet at the same time using my Dial up ISP .	St
1.1.2	I did n't realize that my router does not support the server for dial up connection .	St
1.1.3	Linksys Rep further told me that I still could network both computers at a local level but i would n't be able to use the dial up connection as a gateway .	St
1.1.4	He told me that I could do it through Win XP networking software but he was not allowed to tell me how seeing he works for Linksys etc .	St
1.1.5	Please help ! .	St
1.1.6	I need to know if there is anything I need to purchase in order to network both computers together to run the same dial up connection ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks for all your help in advance .	St
1.1.8	-S	St
1.2.1	will be limited to that of a switch to provide a simple LAN connection between the two PCs .	St
1.2.2	The routers Gateway abilities need to be turned off and set to router functionality .	St
1.2.3	In addition DHCP and NAT addressing gets turned off as well .	St
1.2.4	You would then use the network connection wizard of XP Home on the PC that has the dialup connection .	St
1.2.5	Choosing to use this PC as a Gateway , Windows will use it 's own Internet Sharing Program ( ICS ) to provide a shared Internet connection .	St
1.2.6	A broadband connection to the Internet provides a simpler and much faster connection .	St
1.2.7	If at all possible , this is the way to go .	St
1.3.1	support dial up , one of them is Apple Extreme base station ( not apple express - & gt ; this is an accesspoint only ) .	St
1.3.2	Have a look and get as many information you can get on how to configure etc .	St
1.3.3	better yet google it for such device .	Sug
1.4.1	Thank you so much for your replies .	St
1.4.2	The routers gateway abilities should be disabled in my network connections ?	Ques
1.4.3	I know hardly anything about networking so I wan na make sure that I am doing the steps correctly .	St
1.4.4	I have been battling with this all weekend .	St
1.4.5	You said & quot ; In addition , DHCP and NAT addressing gets turned off as well .	St
1.4.6	Does that automatically happen when I turn off the routers gateway ?	Ques
1.4.7	OR do I have to manually turn that off myself .	St
1.4.8	I already ran XP home networking but I still dont see how it works , sorry for sounding so clueless but maybe I have the cables in the wrong places .	St
1.4.9	I dont want to be changing any settings if there is not need because the only problem being I just got it connected wrong .	St

1.5.1	http : //www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/winxpnet.html well explained , & quot ; user friendly & quot ; hope it helps jonah .	St
1.6.1	I must ask again if broadband is in the works .	St
1.6.2	With high speed Internet this setup becomes almost automatic .	St
1.6.3	In any event , the settings I speak of are in the routers setup program .	St
1.6.4	You access that program by typing 192.168.1.1 in your web browsers address bar .	St
1.6.5	Once in , you type admin into the password box , hit enter and you ahould be in the routers setup page .	St
1.6.6	Referring to the manual on page 29 you will see the settings from Gateway to Router .	St
1.6.7	Page 23 shows where to disable DHCP and page 25 shows where Network Address Settings are disabled .	St
1.6.8	Do n't forget to save your settings after each change .	Sug
1.6.9	Once this is done , your router should now be acting as a wireless access point with a built in switch .	St
1.6.10	You can run the Internet Connection wizard on the PC that has the dialup modem and configure it as the server of the dialup connection .	St
1.6.11	With any luck both PCs will be able to connect to the Internet when the PC hosting the dialup connection is active .	St
