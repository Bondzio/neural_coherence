<s> Dear Cnet members, Earlier today I partitioned my external hard drive using Acronis Disk Director. </s>
<s> I then later found out I didn't need to partition it for the intended purpose so I deleted the partition. </s>
<s> Now it comes up as unallocated space and unless I format it I cannot use it. </s>
<s> Now I want to format it but I want it to go back with the original drive not as a separate one. </s>
<s> For example Original drive F partitioned to F and Y drives. </s>
<s> Then deleted Y and it became un allocated. </s>
<s> I need the Y to merge with the F again. </s>
<s> Sorry fr the poor explanation, it's hard. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> to 'expand or extend' C to use or take-up the unallocated space. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks it worked. </s>
<s> I didn't see that option before in the software. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
