<s> Hard Drive only works by itself in my computer. </s>
<s> If I attach another IDE hdd my computer does not recognise either of them. </s>
<s> This problem only happens with this hard drive. </s>
<s> Any solutions please? </s>
<s> jumper settings on both drives you want to attach. </s>
<s> The best way, with newer drives, is to use an 80 conductor cable and set jumpers to CS (cable select). </s>
<s> The 80 conductor cable has a specific way it needs to be connected to the MB. </s>
<s> The important thing to note is that the blue connector goes to the motherboard. </s>
<s> That you get all the cables and jumpers right. </s>
<s> Here's what you need to know. </s>
<s> Once in awhile you will find a drive that will not tolerate any second IDE device. </s>
<s> This may confuse the new to IDE technician. </s>
<s> After the initial shock and after encountering this a few more times it dawns on the tech that not all IDE devices can coexist. </s>
<s> Yes they should but the awful truth is that a few don't. </s>
<s> At least we have other solutions. </s>
<s> I'll leave jumper and cable discussions out of my replies since that's been done many times and there are plenty of web pages about that. </s>

<s> Hi I am the same person whom you answered in the win xp forum about the sata drivers. </s>
<s> Both hd's are IDE When I plug in my maxtor hard drive with my cd both are recognised When I plug in my western digital hard drive with my cd drive neither are recognised however this hard drive is recognised by itself when the cd drive is not connected. </s>
<s> So I feel that this one hard drive (western digital) which is only being recognised by itself has a problem. </s>
<s> Any solutions please. </s>
<s> I tried using jumpers. </s>
<s> I only have one ide connector. </s>
<s> I need to get this working so I can install windows on it. </s>
<s> Please assist </s>
<s> This WD faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before. </s>
<s> Today i formatted it and was going to install Windows and found that when I plugged in this hd, both ide connections were not being recognised </s>
<s> Please Help </s>
<s> I noted the usual and that jumpers and cables are widely documented. </s>
<s> Can you be more specific? </s>
<s> This WD faulty hd worked as a slave in my other pc before. </s>
<s> Today i formatted it and was going to install Windows and found that when I plugged in this hd, both ide connections were not being recognised I don't understand why it should not work now. </s>
<s> Please help </s>
<s> Parts do fail from time to time. </s>
<s> Folk get the jumpers wrong. </s>
<s> Some can't accept cable, jumper or hardware faults. </s>
<s> Remember that I elected to not write about cables or jumpers as that's been done. </s>
<s> Here's one thought. </s>
<s> Test each drive on its own. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As this pc works with other hard drives using the same cables I would expect it to work. </s>
<s> I am quite sure that my jumpers settings are correct. </s>
<s> Do you need an more details. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> drives work on their own. </s>
<s> No need to talk about cable and jumpers. </s>
<s> I am sure they are correct. </s>
<s> What would be the other cause please? </s>
<s> So Would y?ou say that the hard drive is probably faulty </s>
<s> If the drives work one at a time but not together and you claim the cables and jumpers are fine then it's the usual problem I've seen over the years. </s>
<s> Why not put these two each on their own IDE channel? </s>
<s> don't have another channel. </s>
<s> I have other sata connectors but not another ide one </s>
<s> Faulty drive works in a hard drive external enclosure </s>
<s> Some techs can't wrap their head around that. </s>
<s> And again the jumpers and cable types do matter. </s>
<s> Well discussed but no where did I find where you told exactly what you used. </s>
<s> Could be that issue I noted or could be the jumper and cable issues. </s>
<s> But your posts omit details and I didn't duplicate web content on jumpers and cables. </s>
<s> Makes you wonder if it's one or the other usual issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah you are right. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> this hdd was in my external enclosure and i attempted to install xp. </s>
<s> Computer shutdown with some error. </s>
<s> I then booted into the hdd and it continued to install. </s>
<s> last question. </s>
<s> will this still be a successful install </s>
<s> sorry,No need to answer question thanks a lot </s>
<s> Is when the machine is SATA and can't emulate IDE. </s>
<s> Then when we emulate IDE the IDE ports can become disabled. </s>
<s> The vicious cycle begins. </s>
<s> My lesson on this is simple. </s>
<s> Use an OS that supports SATA. </s>
<s> Yes there are procedures that use a floppy drive but what to do when the floppy drive is broke, missing and the owner won't fix that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't know the model #s, size or age of your Maxtor and WD drives but can tell you that I've never seen a specific jumper standard shared by all drive manufacturers or even between product lines from the same manufacturer. </s>
<s> Since you mentioned using a HD with a CD ROM, I can tell you that this can often through a real monkey wrench into the works. </s>
<s> Be careful of &quot;Master&quot; settings. </s>
<s> Some will allow that setting if only one drive is installed and some consider that the master jumper position means that a slave exists and you cannot use it with a single HD. </s>
<s> What you need is the instructions from the manufacturer for each drive model to figure out their scheme. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the only experiences I've ever had with Maxtor drives have been bad so I avoid them. </s>
<s> I also avoid trying to mix drives from other manufacturers or even vintages. </s>
<s> If one is older IDE and one is called an EIDE, ultra ATA, etc., I wouldn't mix them on the same cable. </s>
<s> Maybe if you know the HD model #s that might help dig up better information about what jumper settings are valid. </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Just one question. </s>
<s> If I have a faulty ribbon cable in a computer is it ok to swap it with another ribbon cable which fits in the computer and makes the computer work or would the new one spoil my computer. </s>
<s> Thanks, AC </s>
<s> Pretty much a generic item. </s>
<s> If you researched this you found 2 common models with 3 connectors and two ribbon cable types. </s>
<s> If you use the older ribbon cable type the worst that could happen is the drive data is corrupted. </s>
<s> The newer ribbon cable type can be used without issue except you have to set the jumpers and the drives must &quot;like&quot; each other. </s>
<s> I covered the old tech stumper earlier about drives that never work on the same IDE channel. </s>
<s> This one has caused months of time lost for some techs. </s>
<s> Some can't wrap their head about that. </s>
