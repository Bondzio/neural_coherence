WHAT is the best way to use this for backing up added data from my current (C:) boot drive (which has all old data transferred to it at installation).. Should I get a program such as Memeo ?, or can I do this manually at intervals of my choosing ?

HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A BACKUP but a fine fast copy. It and any other hard disk system fails some basic backup criteria. Bob
