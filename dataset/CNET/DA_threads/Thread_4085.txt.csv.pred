1.1.1	config : AMD duron 1.1 Ghz PC Chips M811 ver 3.1 Mobo 256 DDR RAM ATI 9200 SE 128 I had a K7SEM mobo that fried ( it seems they are very prone to frying ) so i ordered the M811 and hooked everything up to it .	St
1.1.2	Plugged it in using a 300 W power supply , and nothing happened .	St
1.1.3	Tried a different power supply ( 400W ) and , when i plugged in , the CPU fan twitched..then nothing .	St
1.1.4	Tried yet another power supply ( one im positive works because its powering the computer im using to type this , but only 250W ) and back to nothing .	St
1.1.5	I feel like I 'm grabbing at straws but that little Cpu fan twitch makes me hesitant to throw the mobo out .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone remove all doubt for me/have suggestions on other things to try ?	Ques
1.1.7	thanks in advance -bj-	Polite
1.2.1	To test that the motherboard is not the issue , I take the power supply and the board out on a piece of cardboard and with no CPU , RAM or any other parts power it up .	St
1.2.2	If it does n't power up , it 's the board or PSU .	St

1.3.1	Quick check ... Review the manual/helpguide and verify the frt .	Sug
1.3.2	panel power sw. is actaully on the right connection .	St
1.3.3	Usually a 2-pin connection it can mistaken or misunderstood labeling and thus & quot ; no go & quot ; when sw. is pushed .	St
1.3.4	Further , you can momentarily touch the pin contacts to act as sw. to see if starts then , bad sw. maybe or wrong connector used ( remote ? )	Ques
1.3.5	As for fan twitch , a power surge can do that , a good quality p/s unit locks that down .	St
1.3.6	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	Make sure that you have the 4 pin connector , 2 black wires and 2 yellow wires , plugged into the motherboard .	St
1.4.2	Without that connected , your system will not power up .	St
