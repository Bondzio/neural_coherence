The title says it all.
What you say makes sense, but us common folk don't work with computers all the time and we certainly don't get into code and the inner workings of an OS.
That's why we come on-line asking for help.
Thanks for your help.
I will search for the MOBO drivers and hopefully that will solve my problem.
