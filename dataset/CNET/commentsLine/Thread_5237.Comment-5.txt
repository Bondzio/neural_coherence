thanks for your help, one other thing, as i said when ever i plug it in the hardware wizard opens i just say no to searching for software, and close down the other wizard prompts, then i can use the drive perfectly, but in doing that every time will it harm the drive in any way?
and should i use the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; button before i unplug it?
sorry to be a pain, rob
