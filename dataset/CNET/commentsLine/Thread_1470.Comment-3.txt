thank you for your quick response.
i will try setting this all up and let you know how it worked.
i do not have a laptop or other computer that needs to access these printers and scanner.
i have an epson printer hooked up to my desktop computer (the one i just installed the adapter in) i just need to be able to access the hp photo printer across the room and wishfully the scanner too.
i have no room on or near to my desk for the second printer and scanner.
i can't tell if i needed the router at all or just the printer server and adapter.
i guess i'll just have to try them both ways.
thanks again.
