<s> Hi all, Is that possible to ping another computer with it's firewall on? </s>
<s> I am unable to ping the computer in my living room using my laptop. </s>
<s> Please kindly advise. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But it is possible to turn off the ping response. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But if I cannot ping another computer, I will not be able to access the files in it. </s>
<s> As such, you need to decide. </s>
<s> Firewalls can be setup to block a ping, but to allow file sharing. </s>
<s> The easiest thing maybe to add the second PC into the trusted zone on the firewall, which will allow all traffic from the pc to the firewall to get through. </s>
