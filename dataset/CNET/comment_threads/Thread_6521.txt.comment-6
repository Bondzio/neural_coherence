And paired my logitech bt mouse on both.
It does not come up as a serial port so that's not it.
Did you follow the logitech directions at logitech.com?
For example I didn't read where you press a connect button.
&quot;Logitech keyboards and mice are in discoverable mode when you press the 'Connect' button located on the bottom.&quot;
