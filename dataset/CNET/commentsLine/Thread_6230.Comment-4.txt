1. i cannot centralize the router.
my office is where it is and cannot be moved.
2. if all routers are distance limited then why, if i do a network search, does the computer pick up signals (sometimes moderately strong) from the neighbors routers which are certainly more than 100 feet away?
3. i've heard about gizmos you can buy (that you place in other parts of the house) that boost the router's signal so you can cover more distance.
do these things work?
4. my phones are panasonic dect 6.0.
