I found a post over there that referred me to Netgear, but it's not compatible.
i've sent Netgear a request for a tech note to see if i can configure with a PC and run on a Mac.
I can't think of a good reason why the OS would be a problem for an ethernet converter, but it's probably more than that.
Thanks.
Best, - Bill
