1.1.1	Hello all I have a Snow Leopard iMac with Virtualbox installed .	St
1.1.2	On my Virtualbox i am running windows 7 .	St
1.1.3	My job has two different networks .	St
1.1.4	I need my Mac on Network 1 and I need to have my windows 7 in Virtualbox on network 2 .	St
1.1.5	If i install a USB Ethernet port on the iMac and plug network 2 into it , how can i make it work just for Virtualbox ?	Ques
1.1.6	I then want to make the built in Ethernet port work on network one and be just for the iMac ?	Ques
1.1.7	Can it be done or am i just crazy ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you	St
1.2.1	But I 've seen such requests before so given how this works , I 'm going with not going to work out for you as you planned .	St
1.2.2	Why not connect both networks and then tell Windows to use that LAN ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The problem is the two subnets .	St
1.3.2	One should not be connected to the other.How do i make the mac ignore one of them ?	Ques
1.4.1	The route table , netmask and more details but I only see the tip of the iceberg of information here .	St
1.4.2	While I did write router code back in the early 1990s it appears you are trying something for reasons I can only guess at .	St
1.4.3	At the office I have something like this but I use 3 laptops to do the work .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I work at a school .	St
1.5.2	I need to be connected to the instructional network sot fix computers , monitor student usage and all around support .	St
1.5.3	I also need to be on the administration network for the same reasons .	St
1.5.4	I currently have two computers to do this .	St
1.5.5	I would like to have one computer and put my other one out for student use .	St
1.5.6	I want my Mac on the instructional and my virtual windows on the administration .	St
1.5.7	One can not be connected to the other .	St
1.6.1	We have networks of hardware controls so we emulate this on our test rigs .	St
1.6.2	Given how perilous setting up a single laptop would be and that it would be an emulation of the real thing we do n't do what you propose .	St
1.6.3	But if I was to do this I would be looking at route tables , masks and such .	St
1.6.4	And there 's the rub .	St
1.6.5	Most folk ca n't alter a route table .	St
1.6.6	I know it took me years to learn this .	St
1.6.7	I mean I could issue the command but until I was on that router software dev team I did n't understand it because I did n't have to .	St
1.6.8	Fast forward to your setup .	St
1.6.9	It may take time for you to pound out what your Apple 's route table looks like for this one .	St
