Hi, Alan!
You are a &quot;peach!&quot; Thanks so much!!
I'll try it this evening.
I'm expecting a houseful of people at 5 p.m. for a &quot;farewell&quot; party.
My 21-year-old daughter Emily is leaving Tuesday with the Peace Corps for two years in Benin, in the western part of Africa.
I'll let you know how we make out...
If I can ever return the favor...?!
Ellie
