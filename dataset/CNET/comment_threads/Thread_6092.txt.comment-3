...for backing up and I'm horribly delinquent in getting a solution in place.
SuperDuper was recommended as a good backup program.
But I'm not sure if I need to hardwire each computer to an external drive separately or if there is a good way to take advantage of my wirelss Airport network in backing up both computers to a single backup unit.
It was suggested I would need to partition an external drive to backup the iMac and macbook separately on a single unit.
I have approx 100MB of videos, pics, tunes and documents that I need to backup.
Thanks for any advice.
