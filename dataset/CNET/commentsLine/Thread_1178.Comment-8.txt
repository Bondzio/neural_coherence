any address from 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254 will be visible to each other.
the router will reserve 192.168.1.1 for itself as the gateway to the outside world, so that number is now spoken for.
you've given permission for the router to assign 100 through 119 to dhcp cliet requests.
you don't want to do anything with that range for fear of causing conflicts when it tries to do something of its own accord.
that leaves you complete freedom to assign any address above or below for a device that needs an unwavering address.
personally, i think i'd use the 2 - 99 group for fixed addresses.
that's nearly 100 devices - ain't no way you're ever going to need all of them, but you've got that range to work with.
don't use the 120+ range unless you start way up, say 200+.
that way if you later find you have more than 20 computers and other devices requesting dynamic addresses, you can simply exand the range allowed to the router and know that nothing was assigned nearby.
