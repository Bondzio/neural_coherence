Not sure if these are all related. I installed a demo version of stuffit to open a file someone sent me, and it created some conflicts - so I took it off. Then webroot began having some problems with definition updates. Then began doing sweeps when I didn't ask it to, and didn't log that I had already done one two days ago. Yesterday, my computer crashed and I got messages of address line failure and that the system memory had changed. Then I got cryptic message that a valid definitions file could not be located. I looked at the event viewer and discovered that Webroot perhaps was the culprit, so I removed it. The system memory error messages stopped, and it appeared that things went back to normal. I did scans with avast and alwil they have found no viruses or problems with the system memory. My computer crashed again while I was working on photoshop (the only program running other than avast and zone alarm) this morning, and in the event viewer saw that there was an ftdisk error. Microsoft claims that they don't have any information about it and googling the error brings up too many different fixes that involve a lot of work - I'd like to see if I can narrow it down a bit. There are suggestion from memory stick to power supply failure, to boot-sector viruses. The power supply and mother board battery were replaced within the last year. I am working with XP on a Dell Dimension 8200. I realize that it's an older model, and will be buying a new computer next year - I just can't do it right now. And yes, I've backed up. Many thanks, Adrienne

You didn't tell how long it's been since you cleaned the inside of this PC so let's take a shot at the heat issue. Does leaving the cover off help? Bob

While increasing virtual memory doesn't seem like it would be a bad thing, I'm not sure why I have a memory dump file. Is there anything hurt by either?
953	5	255782	2535879	2535878	adrienne50	7/10/07 9:17 AM	1.18405902E12	and also	I guess I don't really understand about dump files and page files, in other words.

Or something that is causing disk reads or writes to fail (heat does that as well as power supplies, etc.) The current wisdom with XP and beyond is to &quot;let Windows manage it.&quot; Read more about this at http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/xpvm.php Bob
953	7	255782	2535923	2535899	adrienne50	7/10/07 10:09 AM	1.18406214E12	hmmm	I opened my box as you suggested, and then decided that increasing the virtual memory at the same time would not tell me whether it's a heat problem. But not before I opened photoshop and did some work (I forgot I'd changed it). When I put the memory down to what it's been at, photoshop hung. No crashes, but I could barely get out of PS. So then the question is, for a memory-intensive program like photoshop (or running several different things like computer protection, skype, firefox, etc., is 2000 MB too little? Could that be the problem?
953	8	255782	2535925	2535923	adrienne50	7/10/07 10:14 AM	1.18406244E12	Or...	Would that maybe point to a problem with one of the memory sticks? As a note, I replaced my hard drive about a year ago after it died. If another drive goes, I wonder if there's something going on with the mother board that could corrupt a drive? As I mentioned, the power supply was also replaced. This was a good computer for about 4 years. But maybe I won't go with Dell next time around. Golems in the gears.
953	9	255782	2535950	2535925	R. Proffitt	7/10/07 10:37 AM	1.18406382E12	Sorry which OS?	For XP, Vista we let it manage it. Even with your noted application. As to the Dell comment, ALL makers were hit with the issue noted at http://news.cbsi.com/PCs+plagued+by+bad+capacitors/2100-1041_3-5942647.html so to pan Dell for a machine past 4 years old... There are other issues such as fans that slow with time, etc. But no maker would be immune here. Sorry but so far the clues only point to possible heat issues. Bob

However, after about an hour Microsoft gave me updates, and I restarted. Got the following errors: Configuring the Page file for crash dump failed. Make sure there is a page file on the boot partition and that is large enough to contain all physical memory. The Eplpdx02 service could not be started. DCOM got error &quot;The service database is locked. &quot; attempting to start the service netman with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {BA126AE5-2166-11D1-B1D0-00805FC1270E} DCOM got error &quot;The service database is locked. &quot; attempting to start the service iPod Service with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {063D34A4-BF84-4B8D-B699-E8CA06504DDE} And actually two of the last three are driver errors that I get intermittently (dont' know what netman is). Although I've followed directions to try to get rid of them, I've had no luck. I have the computer open and still getting the ftdisk error this morning - but it could be heat related. Thankfully, no crashes since I opened the box, even though I've deliberately not held myself back from opening programs as I need them. If there is one silver lining, increasing the virtual memory has erased the problem I had with photoshop and page maker being finicky to use at the same time. Any ideas about the error messages being related or not? Many thanks.

Thanks for the help - I guess I'm on the road to some sort of answer now. Perhaps ultimately to ditch this computer and get a new one that doesn't hiccup every time I look at a new program. (Though I imagine that's a perennial problem with all computers.) Thanks again for your help. At least I got the newsletter out without my computer dying - and that's a good thing! Adrienne
953	13	255782	2537558	2537344	adrienne50	7/12/07 4:31 AM	1.18421466E12	No error messages?	Last night I see there were two warning messages: The system failed to flush data to the transaction log. Corruption may occur. The time service has not been able to synchronize the system time for 49152 seconds because none of the time providers has been able to provide a usable time stamp. The system clock is unsynchronized. This morning I got black screened, and upon manual shut down and restart I got the following message: Memory read/write failure at OA824364, read 8260882D expecting 826D826D. Decreasing available memory. Memory address line failure at )A380000, read 00000000 expecting 7C7C7C7C. Decreasing available memory. The amount of system memory has changed. When I asked it to start normally, it behaved like a computer with limited memory - working very slowly. I restarted and got the same message as last time: Amount of system memory has changed. I started normally. Although the computer appears to be working at normal speed again, my task bar is white and the text is another font. The temperature is about 75 degrees. I don't know if the temperature yesterday would have anything to do with it, but it was working fine when I went to bed. My gut is giving me a bad feeling about this - that it may indeed be the memory sticks. Hope you're still tracking this discussion and would be grateful for any input. Thanks.

The &quot;time service&quot; entry can be ignored. I'll decline a long explanation. Back to memory. Try this test -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=MEMTEST86&btnG=Google+Search bOB

953	16	255782	2537873	2537558	R. Proffitt	7/12/07 10:39 AM	1.18423674E12	It's free. Why some pay is...	They don't know how to create the boot CD or diskette. Bob

953	18	255782	2537878	2535871	R. Proffitt	7/12/07 10:55 AM	1.1842377E12	A different view.	Remember that there are all skill levels out there. There are those that can't use downloads at all since it may require one to unzip, install or make a diskette or CD. This is why you see such for sale. Hope that clears that question up. Bob
953	19	255782	2537970	2537878	adrienne50	7/12/07 11:32 AM	1.18423992E12	You're the best	Thanks!

I couldn't find a page that explains what all the data was (if you know of a link, I'd be interested in reading it), but it was clear enough that something was awry with 3-7000 errors per sweep and at least 20 notations of bad ram. Instead of trying to figure out which stick was bad though, I decided to replace. Given that I will not be able to buy a new computer in the next year or at worst maybe two or three, I decided after seeing the RDram prices that buying without upgrading would not be so smart. 2.2 GHz is still a pretty decent speed for an old model, and I found a semi-okay price for a 2G set. Throwing $500 into an old computer might seem excessive, but I can't tell you how pleased I am - I'm working on an image-packed publication right now, and this computer sings! I don't have to reinstall or transfer anything, I can sit back while the rest of the world works out the Vista bugs, and I'm not adding to the mountain of discarded hardware (yet). God willin' (if something else doesn't go wrong), someday we can make this sweetie into a server or have an extra computer for someone else to use. Thanks for all your help. Adrienne
