I just scanned a 38-page document - all type, no graphics - and it ended up being 217 mg. Obviously too big to mail or do anything with. I tried to compress it, but it only compressed down to 117 mg. Any idea what I am doing wrong? Thanks!

If you wanted to put it to text you have a few choices. 1. Contact the owner of the document and ask for the word or text file version. 2. Run it through some OCR and correct it as you see fit. Bob

All I want to do is scan a piece of paper (doc) to become a PDF so I can email it. I don't want to run it through OCR. But for some reason the printer/scanner is scanning at 100MG instead of the typical 78kb. The software for the scan function seems to have hit a glitch. It is also showing the size of the doc as 22x30&quot;, not the page setting of 8x11&quot;. I just thought someone else might have experienced this abnormality. Thanks anyway.

If you scan the document using the OCR function, then you get a text file. It sounds like the 38 pages were scanned as a single page, not individual graphics, thus you get one long graphic. I have used my HP multi-function printer to scan documents and have selected either the graphic output, or the text output. If you select PDF output, it is still going to output the pages as graphic captures and not text. The resolution you set for the scan will also affect the size of the output file in bytes and in inches.

HP scanning software often defaults to a 24 bit color mode, even if you're scanning black and white documents. The scanner and its software can't determine what you're scanning. You have to set the requirements yourself. If you just want to scan black &amp; white text documents, there should be a setting in your scanning software that is labeled as such i.e., &quot;black &amp; white,&quot; or just, &quot;text.&quot; Avoid settings for, &quot;256 shades of gray,&quot; unless you need it for some kind of black and white image, and avoid the OCR option unless you actually need to attempt text editing on the final document. OCR recognition will only work well if you're scanning very legible text and it will also add to the file size of the finished document. Most of this should be in the Help menus of scanning software.

It may default to the maximum size of the scanner bed, but you need to tell it the size of your scanned document. Once again, only you would know this.
