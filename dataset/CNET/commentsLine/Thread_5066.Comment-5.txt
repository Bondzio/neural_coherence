i'm gonna go with the pc3200, so it doesnt blow up my machine... i think this is the one you showed me (or similar).
another one, price a lil higher.
these are the same brand name, but they have xms.
what is that?
is it important to get the heat spreader feature?
here some more.
these are from kingston.
sorry, this is the first time to worry about this.
lol several years ago, when i bought a 256 mb, all i did was ask someone at the store on which one would work and i bought it.
lol i have a 256 and 128 sticks.
i'm taking them both out and having two of 512. also, i'm seeing some 512 in pairs... are they like bundle, two at a cheaper price, or are they for like dual something?
or should i just buy 2 of 1 stick?
