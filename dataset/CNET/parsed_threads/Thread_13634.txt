<s> I have a Sony Playstation 2 and want to hook it up to my home wireless network. </s>
<s> The only problem is that you can only plug cat5 cable to the network adapter of the PS2 and I don't know of any wireless recivers that you can hook up via cat5. </s>
<s> I have only seen USB ones, and ones that you put directly in your computer. </s>
<s> Can anybody tell me how to get my PS2 hooked up to my wireless network? </s>
<s> Thank You! </s>

<s> Try this unit: http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=38&prid=550 </s>
<s> Use Apple's Airport Express to connect to an existing wireless network using an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> There are a few solutions that might work. </s>
<s> The first one is pretty obvious and most people don't want to do this, but you could get a really long ethernet cable (CAT5) and run the cable from your router to your PS2. </s>
<s> Or you can share your internet connection from a computer in your house that is already on the wireless network (I don't know how to do this, but i believe it is possible). </s>
<s> Also Linksys makes a Wireless ethernet bridge, which connects to an ethernet port on a game console, or computer and sends and receives information via the wireless network ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1056281391242&skuId=5732889&type=product ) has one but it is expensive. </s>
<s> There is also the WET11 Linksys wireless ethernet bridge, but I don't currently have a link to that. </s>
<s> I bet it is easy to find. </s>
<s> I believe that is cheaper as well. </s>
<s> Hope this helps </s>
<s> Hello, The best way to connect your PS2 to the wireless network is via a WiFi repeater as is sold in the store Pixinf. </s>
<s> This device lets you connect your PS2 to the wireless network anywhere on the home and increases the signal range of existing wireless network. </s>
<s> Works for me perfectly and also use to connect the TV to the Internet. </s>
