for such purposes (and, in fact, higher volume in black text) i'm happy with a cheap canon printer, especially the older types for which you can buy compatible cartridges and replace the printhead yourself (i had to do that once).
cartridges and printheads come separately.
in the unlikely case the printhead is clogged (won't happen if you print each week, use the original cartridge, and leave the printer connected to the mains) you can find (non-canon) cleaning cartridges.
i had to use one of those recently after using a refilled cartridge (not sure that was the cause, however).
all other cartridges (original or compatible alike) i could use till they were totally empty.
i also like the driver support for concept quality and printing half size (2 pages on one sheet) for text.
