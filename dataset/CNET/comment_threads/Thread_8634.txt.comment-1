COMP: 3.0 Intel 2GB Ram GeForce 6800 19&quot; WideScreen LCD PC/TV 19&quot; LCD Moniter ------------------- Ok on to the problem i'm having..
I don't know much about computer hardware so its been hard trying to figure this one out.
I am trying to get my display shown on two moniters but I don't really want the extended desktop.
Just want one moniter to show exactly whats on the other one..
Both Moniters support DVI cables and VGA cables and I was wondering is there a possible way to hook up one as VGA and one as DVI or what do i have to do to solve this problem?
Thank you
