i have a theory brewing that a new piece of malware could remove the 48-bit registry entry noted at  and cause users too much grief.
i'm sharing that this is only a theory in that i've only presented it for testing to &quot;someone&quot; and the pest, parasite and malware issue seems to be getting worse.
it's so bad that a common piece of advice i hand out daily is to not use ie when you can use anything else.
why stand in the line of fire?
check that registry entry and let us know.
if you are doing 'anything' dangerous with your pc such as p2p, using ie/oe, then you may want to move to 137gb drives.
