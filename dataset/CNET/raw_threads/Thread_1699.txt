5533	0	332009	2988417	NR	Re1gn77	2/25/09 11:05 AM	1.2355599E12	First build questions/suggestions	I am about to build my first PC (attempt really but being positive) and wanted to get some feedback on what I have came up with so far. I am working with a limited budget and chose my components based on being able to add &quot;more&quot; later when money is not so tight. Basically I am going for a mid-low high end gaming PC that has some customization options for the future. Motherboard and CPU - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4179115&CatId=3586 Memory - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3404049&Sku=O261-8038 HDD - also use a 500GB ext. for media http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3255389&CatId=2458 CD/DVD - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3970770&Sku=L12-1166%20OEM Power Supply - I am curious about this one and what you all would suggest. Since I wasn't sure I made room for a 750w power supply. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3276567&Sku=ULT-LSP750 Case - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2477938&CatId=1842 Video Cards (to be added later) - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4209965&Sku=P450-9830 I plan on using Vista 64-bit to take advantage of the 4GB + memory. From what I understand 32 only uses 3GB and recognizes the other 1GB as &quot;virtual memory&quot; if I have this fouled up please explain. Also since I fully plan to upgrade later to the full 8GB that the mobo allows it seemed like the best choice. Ok so let her rip and let me hear it, have I covered everything? Would you make different choices and if so why? I appreciate any and all help in this matter since I am very excited at the prospect of building my first &quot;rig&quot;, and am somewhat anxious to get underway with the contruction.

GIGABYTE GA-MA780G-UD3H, $90: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128382 AMD Phenom 9950 BLACK 2.6GHz, $148: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103291 i'd also steer clear of ultra power supplies. they have about 3 different lines and a number of them are crap. this 550w 80 plus certified will handle your pc as well as a lesser quality 700w unit: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817702008

5533	3	332009	2989003	2988805	ramarc	2/26/09 6:56 AM	1.23563136E12	no, phenom IIs are more expensive	the cheapest phenom ii x4 is the 810 at $180. the fastest phenom ii is the 940 which is $150. there is no pricing overlap between phenom and phenom ii.

And later on when I can work in a AM3 mobo and memory it is ready to go for that as well.

To give a simple analogy using base 10 Math, consider trying to put more than 100 addresses into strictly 2 digit form using only 0-9 for each value. There are 100 possibilities, from 00 to 99 to be specific. That last 1 GB of memory that you say is &quot;virtual&quot; is actually the memory reserved for various bits of hardware like sound, video, network and other parts. &quot;Virtual memory&quot; is what an operating system takes off of the hard drive on a computer to use as extra memory space.
