When I pluged it in my new computer it was not given a letter even though it was listed in disk management. I purchase Partition Magic8. I was able to extract all in information but now I want to reformat so I can use it again. When I tried to do it with PartitionMagic I got this error message...Error #109 partition ends after end of disk, UcEndCylinder (1247) must be less than 1247, Disk geometry errors. I've tried to contact them but have had no responce for weeks now.

I used it before to try and extract the infor but all it would let me do is delete the partition. So once I got all the info out of it now I deleted it and now it gave me a letter. WOW Thanks
