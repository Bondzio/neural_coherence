zip drives used to come with software on one of zip disks in the bundle.
this disk was the tools disk and was protected as it had the installation software on it.
included was a utility to &quot;unlock&quot; the disk so you could use it like any other.
is it possible this could be one of those protected disks?
if so, iomega software utilities might be able to unlock it.
just a thought...good luck.
