1.2.1	http://hothardware.com/Reviews/Hard-Drive-Overdrive-Corsairs-Accelerator-Series-Reviewed-/ I didn't find what the current motherboard is so I can't see if you can pop in a newer CPU.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	It is a Dell (intel) mobo and no....	St
1.3.2	I can't just pop a new cpu in.	St
1.4.1	What stopped you?	Ques
1.4.2	Also, since it is a Dell, is the Windows from Dell or OEM.	St
1.4.3	That's another 130 buck or so.	St
1.4.4	Bob PS.	St
1.4.5	Which Dell (intel) mobo?	St
1.5.1	If you aren't a bot then maybe you should just not be giving advice.	Sug
1.5.2	the computer is old the motherboard won't accept anything better as far as CPU goes the OS has nothing to do with this.	St
1.5.3	You obviously can't read or you would already know all of this.	Polite
1.5.4	Please don't respond anymore to my post.	St
1.5.5	I'm trying to get someone who actually has some knowledge to give me some advice.	St
1.5.6	thank you,,,, but no thanks.	Polite
1.6.1	Sorry that you took offense at trying to avoid the added cost.	St
1.6.2	-&gt; Try this.	St
1.6.3	Head to Tomshardware.com and see how each CPU on your list compared in benchmarks.	St
1.6.4	Go with the winner.	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Since you are looking at motherboards to go with, also look at what Gigabyte has to offer, I don't have a problem with AMD processors in desktop builds, though I prefer Intel.	St
1.7.2	You didn't mention whether you were going to go with for a PSU, that is definitely a consideration, DVD drive shouldn't be an issue and hopefully neither should the Vid ram.	St
1.7.3	The other basics, ram, etc.	St
1.7.4	should be at least adequate for your intended purposes.	St
1.8.1	Top.....I5 Middle....Fx Bottom....965 That's based on one benchmark tool.	St
1.8.2	YMMV.	St
