<s> My mouse keeps freezing up. </s>
<s> I am running XP Pro. </s>
<s> I thought it might be my cordless mouse but I put on the old mouse and it still does the same thing. </s>
<s> I have to shut my computer down to get it to work. </s>
<s> It will work for awhile then it does it again. </s>
<s> If this is not the right forums to ask this question, please direct me to the proper one. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You'd have to provide more information. </s>
<s> Mouse freeze is a type of system freeze, and often, a complete lockup follows right afterwards. </s>
<s> Could be caused by anything... </s>
<s> The mouse will not move but my keyboard will still work. </s>
<s> Since I am not very good at using the keyboard to access things I just turn the computer off. </s>
<s> I thought I might have an virus so I ran norton and plus I ran spy doctor to check and see if anything would be there too. </s>
<s> I think you may have a virus/spyware, as you suggested. </s>
<s> Try looking at your process list to see if you have any unnecessary processes running. </s>
<s> If you press-and-hold ctrl, then shift, then delete, the task manager will open. </s>
<s> Next, click the &quot;processes&quot; tab, and click on the &quot;name&quot; button. </s>
<s> This will alphabatize them, which sometimes helps. </s>
<s> Go to... http://www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm ... this site for help on what processes are needed and what ones are not. </s>
<s> Once you have closed several processes that are unneeded, your computer will probably speed up some. </s>
<s> Also, it might be good if you go into the options menu, select &quot;hide when minimized,&quot; and then minimize it. </s>
<s> The little performance icon will sit in your tray, and you can monitor when your computer gets slower, because you will see more green bars lit. </s>
<s> If your mouse freezes up, and the box is completely green, you know that it is freezing up because of your computer being slow. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... hasta luego! </s>
