i've just installed a new mother board and processor into my pc and now i cannot transfer my video to my pc.
my firewire pci card is installed correctly and the camera is recognised by win xp home and i can control the camera (rewind the tape)but i get an error when trying to capture the video.
the sony suplied software does not recognise the camera.
adobe premier pro and win movie maker recognises it.
please can anyone help
