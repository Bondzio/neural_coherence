1.1.1	Does anybody know anything about Fujitsu computers?	Ques
1.1.2	They are a big company over here in Japan but I am not sure if they sell their computers back in the the U.S., or maybe they do but under a different name.	St
1.1.3	Anyway, my current computer is over 5 years old and is pretty much shot.	St
1.1.4	Instead of trying to have it fixed and upgrade all the old components it would probably be better to just buy a new one.	St
1.1.5	I saw the following Fujitsu desktop in a computer store near my home as was just wondering if anybody thinks it's any good.	St
1.1.6	I tried looking for a computer with similiar stuff on the CNET Product Reviews site but had no luck.	St
1.1.7	So, I am going to try and include as much information as possible in this post and see what people think.	St
1.1.8	I apologize in advance for the length.	St
1.1.9	Model: Fujitsu FMV Deskpower FMV CE50H7 CPU: AMD Athlon XP 2800+ Cache Memory: 256MB (Primary); 512MB(Secondary) Chipset: SiS Company SiS741LV Chipset System bus: 333 Mhz Main Memory: Standard: 256MB (DDR SDRAM-DIMM, PC3200) Slots: 2 Open slots Upper Limit Memory: 1 GB Monitor: 17&quot; Digital LCD (Full Color 167,700,000 colors) Video Memory: 32 MB Graphics Accelerator: SiS Company SiS741LV FDD: optional HDD: 160GB (Ultra ATA/100, 7200turns/sec) DVD Drive: Super Multi Drive (DVD-RAM: Read 3x/Write 3x; DVD-R: Read 8x/Write 8x; DVD-RW: Read 8x/Write 4x; DVD+R: Read 8x/Write 8x; DVD+RW: Read 8x/Write 4x; DVD-ROM: Read 12x; CD: Read 32x; CD-R: Write 24x; CD-RW: Write 10x) Audio Function: internal chipset + AC97 Codec Speakers: internal (inside monitor) Modem: 56kbps (V.90 standard) 100BASE-TX/10BASE-T TV Capability: Yes It also has 2 slots for PC cards, 1 for SD Cards, 6 USB ports, input for S-Video or for three color VCR input cables, digital audio input and other stuff.	St
1.1.10	Can record upto 140 hours of TV programs directly onto the DVD-RAM.	St
1.1.11	Price is 160,000 yen ($1300-$1400?)	St
1.1.12	Even though the there a few things that probably could be better (ie: (1) the primary cache is only 256, (2) the CPU is not Pentium 4 (3) The graphics card seems to be an intergrated one (4) the systems bus is not 400Mhz or above) is this a good deal or should I keep looking?	St
1.2.1	It's just another PC.	St
1.2.2	I can't comment on the price since here it's double what we pay for such.	St
1.2.3	See http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=3005026&cat=SYS Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info.	St
1.3.2	I figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the U.S., but I guess there's no way around that.	St
1.3.3	It looks like that Gateway PC doesn't come with a monitor.	St
1.3.4	According to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so I guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference.	St
1.3.5	Couldn't tell from the page, but does that PC include DVD-RAM as well?	St
1.3.6	And, did it have TV capability?	St
1.3.7	Thanks again for the link.	St
1.4.1	It's dead here.	St
1.4.2	There is no interest in DVD-RAM and if I wanted such a drive, it's about 30 bucks on the used market.	St
1.4.3	As to TV cards, such are 49 bucks retail.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks again for the reply.	St
1.5.2	That's interesting.	St
1.5.3	I think DVD-RAM is a big selling point over here.	St
1.5.4	TV cards are also a big selling point as well.	St
1.5.5	The sales rep at the store I went to said that it would be better to get a computer that came with a TV card preinstalled since the good ones cost about $300 (my guess) on their own.	St
1.5.6	Your replies have made me start to seriously consider ordering a computer from a U.S. company over the net.	St
1.5.7	Can you or anybody else recommend any going places that ship internationally and offer good support?	Ques
1.5.8	Also, I would need to get really good Japanese language capability so do you think I'll need a Japanese OS for that?	St
1.5.9	Thanks again.	Polite
1.6.1	I've found &quot;support&quot; to be only for the hardware.	St
1.6.2	Some owners lose their cool when they find out that software support isn't being offered at the discount prices.	St
1.6.3	Is this OK?	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
