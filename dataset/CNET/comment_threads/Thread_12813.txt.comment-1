After uninstalling Boot Camp (uninstalled due to incorrect xp cd), my MacBook now boots slowly than before Boot Camp was installed.
Before it would boot up in around 20 seconds.
Now, when I push the power button all I get is a light gray color screen for about 25 seconds and the hard drive is not being accessed during that time.
Then, the apple logo appears and booting finishes normally.
The whole process now takes around 50 seconds to complete.
That is the only thing I can think of that would cause the problem.
If anyone can help, it would be appreciated.
Thanks!
