the error message has a ms notation.
the ms q-number shows your video driver is stuck in an endless loop.
also shows this mostly happens when symantec pc anywhere is installed.
first off, i would completely uninstall the video card and drivers.
reboot and reinstall, being sure to disable any anti-virus (and pc anywhere, if it is on the machine).
probably things are out of sequence.
also,lcds have a native resolution.
you don't a lot of choices like a crt.
good luck.
