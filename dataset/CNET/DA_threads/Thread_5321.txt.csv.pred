1.1.1	Hi , I have a desktop ( costom built ) and I was just wondering if I should get an ssd ?	Ques
1.1.2	Is it worth it to replace my 7200rpm 2tb hard drive with an ssd or should I just stick with the hard drive I have ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.3	Specs : 2tb7200rpm hdd , 12gb ram , gtx 650ti ( 2gb ) , win7 ( 64bit ) , and an intel core i7 2700k	St
1.2.1	The immediate effect of having a ssd is speed .	St
1.2.2	The response is going to be noticed .	St
1.2.3	There is however the negative effect over time that usage causes some degradation due to the nature of data storage as R/W wear is n't so easily gotten rid of .	St
1.2.4	This all depends on the maker 's quality of product and how they deal with it .	St
1.2.5	It should n't be that different from one maker to another but cheaper models are n't going last long .	St
1.2.6	take what you want from this but overall your 2tb is already providing use that at about the best traditional HD offer .	St
1.2.7	It 's best advantage is they are cheaper for the amount of storage media provided compared to ssd .	St
1.2.8	Since , you already have the 2tb , use it then you can add a ssd later as time passes .	St
1.2.9	You may want to make the ssd the boot drive for quick boots .	St
1.2.10	You may want to look at & quot ; hyreid drives & quot ; .	St
1.2.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I 'll give the nod to & quot ; drive accelerators. & quot ; I 'll stop here and add that on the laptops we are using the hybrid drives since we want the boost without the restrictions .	St

1.4.1	In fairness to Willy , I 'd agree that speed is the main advantge of SSD drives - access times are a tenth of the best of traditional HDD 's , but the other big advantage is that of heat - specificlly , lack of it .	St
1.4.2	Another one is the relatively small current needed to run an SSD drive ; five years ago I built a webserver with five SATA2 drives , one carried the OS and programs/drivers etc. , and the other four were storage drives .	St
1.4.3	When fully booted , that rig was marginal on a 550-watt PSU with 2xOpteron 275 's and a watercooling system on the chip , CPU 's and GPU .	St
1.4.4	My main server now runs two 500Gb SSD 's , one x6 Phenom with NO secondary drives and just two 120mm fans .	St
1.4.5	Three cloud providers host over seven hundred gig of data on the web , and even doing it that way , it 's still 30 % faster than the big bomber I started with .	St
1.4.6	As far as longevity is concerned , well I ca n't really comment ; all data on the server is backed up to & quot ; conventional & quot ; HDD 's on the old server , which only lights itself up when changes are made .	St
1.4.7	All in all , the SSD setup has saved me over & # 163 ; 200 a month , so it 's already paid for itself .	St
1.5.1	that came with my system and moved it to a second bay .	St
1.5.2	It was when my system was new and after I installed the apps I needed and then I cloned it .	St
1.5.3	I moved the SSD to bay 1 and the HD to bay 2 .	St
