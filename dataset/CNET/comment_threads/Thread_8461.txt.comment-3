I have a Dell 1700FP and a IBM 9519-AG1 that have the same problem.
They were both being used on a Dell Optiplex GX110.
Since they are both doing the same thing I was wondering if they are stuck in EnergySaving/hiebernation mode or something like that?
We pushing the on/off button on either one nothing happens.
They just continue to blink.
No screen.
Doesn't even flicker.
Can only turn them off if I unplug them from the wall.
