I have an old Dlink DI-604 that I'd like to configure to work as a switch.
I think this is possible but not sure how to do it.
Switches are cheap but if I could save a few bucks with some tweaking I'd prefer that.
Plus I figure I'd learn a bit about networking.
Dlinks site on the DI-604: http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=62 My main problem is I have Uverse and I'm out of wired ports on the Residential Gateway.
I would like 2 more ports to network my PC and NAS, so my laptop and Xbox can access their files.
