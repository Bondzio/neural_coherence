having a powerbook and wanting to go wireless, i figured this would be a good device to go with.
my question is this: if my brother has a pc that is connected to his cable modem, do i merely place the apple airport express in between his cable modem and pc, and then reap the benefits of having internet in my room wirelessly?
is it that simple?
thanks.
