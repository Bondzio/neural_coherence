use the heatpipes and then orient the fan the way that the BTX systems do.
The fan is perpendicular to the mobo, thus has a clear flow path through the fins with very little backpressure, rather than forcing air down the fins towards the CPU.
I suspect that aspect of the BTX design may be the most useful part of it.
The CPU fan is actually helping the total airflow path.
