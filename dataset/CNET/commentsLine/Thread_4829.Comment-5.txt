took out the battery and the card.
although i didn't disconnect the 2 wires to the card.
replaced.
no change.
at this point i am going to assume that it is either the card or the connection between the card and the computer.
so i think i'll get a card and try to replace it.
at this point, i hope that that's the problem w the least troublesome solution.
can anyone tell me how to disconnect/reconnect the 2 wires?
i don't know how it attaches... screw, clasp over a bulb... snap?
