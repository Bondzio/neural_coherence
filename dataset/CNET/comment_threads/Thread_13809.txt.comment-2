To people who might think I'm stealing (!
): (1) I asked my next door neighbor and he said it's OK if I use his wireless connection!
Plus, (2) I don't do hard-core downloading or video streaming or anything!!!
I only check my emails and make Skype phone calls!
Also, (3) according to state law it's not stealing if the network is not locked!
One more question: Which router do you recommend for this matter?
