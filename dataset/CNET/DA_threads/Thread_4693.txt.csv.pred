1.1.1	My esk top runs on windows vista 64 bit have internet explorer 8 I want to know how can i shut off any programs running in the background and how to find out if there is anything running in background .	St
1.2.1	For example http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-10149_102-308311/how-do-i-disable-unnecessary-programs-running-in-my-pcs-background/ has over 200 answers on this .	St
1.2.2	I think there 's usually little to be gained here .	St
1.2.3	You are running Vista 64 so the only thing I will offer is that it was a bit of a slug ( the OS ) and if you had less than 4GB RAM almost nothing you could do would make it respond faster .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	you need to gather information from various sources .	St
1.3.2	The best source , perhaps , is yourself .	St
1.3.3	When you install software the install/setup process will often ask if you want to & quot ; Allow { this software } to load on Startup & quot ; or similar option .	St
1.3.4	Sadly that option is normally already selected and you actually have to 'opt out ' by de-selecting it .	St
1.3.5	If the option was to 'opt in ' , then even if we do n't watch the setup process step by step , we would n't have any unwanted software loading at startup .	St
1.3.6	The other options are ; 1 ] The Start menu & gt ; All programs & gt ; Startup folder .	St
1.3.7	Any entries in there means that application will load at startup .	St
1.3.8	You can delete that shortcut but it would also be advisable to open the application itself and check its options as it maybe set always to load at startup 2 ] MSCONFIG - Goto Start then type msconfig in the search box and select the first entry in the list .	Sug
1.3.9	This opens the & quot ; Startup Configuration Editor & quot ; .	St
1.3.10	Head over to the Startup tab and look down the list to see what is set to run at startup .	St
1.3.11	You can disable those from there .	Sug
1.3.12	any entries you are not sure about you cans search for in Google or your favorite search engine .	St
1.3.13	3 ] The Task Manager - Open the Task Manager , ( right click the Taskbar , select Task Manager ) , and in the new window select the Processes tab .	St
1.3.14	be sure to select the option at the bottom of the window to & quot ; Show processes for all users & quot ; .	St
1.3.15	This lists the processes for all the software that is currently running on your computer .	St
1.3.16	Some may be processes from applications that have loaded at startup and which are not listed in the steps 1 and 2 , but to be sure you would have to open the applications that use those processes to double check .	St
1.3.17	Google will help you identify the list of processes .	St
1.3.18	Mark	St
