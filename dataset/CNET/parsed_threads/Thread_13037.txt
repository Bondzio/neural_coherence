<s> Hi all, think this is probably my first ever post here. </s>
<s> Anyways, my matter is as follows: I do a lot of scientific computing on my desktop, runing R or occasionally MatLab codes. </s>
<s> The programmes run for several hours typically. </s>
<s> The calculation is mostly simple +-*/^, just that the number of iterations is usually very very large. </s>
<s> And quite often, I work with high dimension matrices. </s>
<s> As my old Dell desktop is dying, I am starting to plan next work station and I would love to build one by myself. </s>
<s> My key question is which specification should I be after? </s>
<s> Is it a fast CPU? </s>
<s> Lots of memory? </s>
<s> L2 cache? </s>
<s> I don't really have a clue. </s>
<s> Don't know if this is feasible at all, but I have a budge round 500 (or $800) for mobo/cpu/memory/case/psu. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> What I'd do is copy someone's working machine. </s>
<s> Also, your OS and software will eat up most of the budget so you may have to consider the Intel i3 CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick response! </s>
<s> My budget is only for the listed hardware. </s>
<s> All the software and OS is either free or transferable from my old PC so not a problem. </s>
<s> I have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather &quot;general&quot; purposes whereas I am hoping to make a well tailored one specifically for my needs. </s>
<s> Also I have asked around my friends who work on similar things, they all seem to be happy with their current settings (mostly core2duo, a few i3 i5). </s>
<s> Maybe I am a bit impatient, but at least I'd like to try and see if I can make a change </s>
<s> &quot;I have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather &quot;general&quot; purposes&quot; If it is that special purpose then why would we consider a general purpose computer? </s>
<s> Sorry but let me introduce myself. </s>
<s> I'm one of those folk that designs embedded computers and other solutions. </s>
<s> The reason we use general purpose computers on Intel and such CPUs is they deliver a big bang for the buck. </s>
<s> These are not considered &quot;specific purpose&quot; like a recent design had with a rack of DSP (digital signal processing) CPUs. </s>
<s> I'd reconsider a nice ready to use Intel i7 machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So back to my original question, if you don't mind, with a constrained budget as mine, should I invest in cpu, memory, mobo or a bit of everything? </s>
<s> Could you recommend some ready to use machines? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The usual 4GB Intel i7 powered machine. </s>
<s> Even a dell might be found for that if you don't go with GAMER video cards. </s>
<s> Too bad the machine you use today was not revealed. </s>
<s> It could serve as a point of reference. </s>
<s> Such as it's 2GB versus 4GB. </s>
<s> Why it matters is that 4GB is not double 2GB. </s>
<s> It's much more than that since the OS ate a little (?) </s>
<s> of that 2GB. </s>
<s> I see folk going overboard on such things. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your budget limits you IMO. </s>
<s> You maybe better to get the absolute best cpu you can afford with SOME ram. </s>
<s> The ram you can add more later. </s>
<s> Your s/w MUST BE capable of using whatever it has available so if the cpu being muliple core gets full usage under demand, etc.. </s>
<s> The ram alone is highly desirable as it needs that to breathe sorta speak and flex its muscles. </s>
<s> While the i5 class of cpu maybe costly compared to i3, you would be better served and the cpu cache should be at least 4M, better if possible. </s>
<s> The i3 is more of entry level or offering on a budget. </s>
<s> besides Intel, AMD offers good cpus too, but IMHO sticking with Intel would be a better choice. </s>
<s> Check the Intel support website and locate the specs of i3 and i5 and compare, AMD too if you like. </s>
<s> A work station is more of a workhorse rather than a home desktop and speed isn't usually the main factor, its what it can do for long periods and/or tasks. </s>
<s> As Robert pointed out, see what a workstation consists of and see if you build similar. </s>
<s> I definitely would look for many ram slots and the mtrbd. </s>
<s> chipset and in many cases video is build-in and shouldn't be a big factor in your final system. </s>
<s> Effectively you want raw power rather than speed. </s>
<s> Cooling should be a must too and darn good big case to house it all. </s>
<s> Help??? </s>

<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/ is a start. </s>
<s> I see a Dell with the i7 at 899 which isn't bad for a ready to use machine considering the i7 alone is a big chunk of the outlay. </s>

<s> I learnt a lot from reading your posts. </s>
<s> Thanks Robert. </s>
<s> My current PC is a Dell Dimension 5100 with Core2Duo E6400 and 2G memory, which I purchased years ago. </s>
<s> I doubt if there's anything in there valuable for my new PC, so I am planning to convert it into a media PC to use with my TV. </s>
<s> I guess I will play with an i7 setting for a bit and see how the price come together. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> Thanks Willy for the details. </s>
<s> That link seems interesting - I guess the mindset for building workstations hasn't changed so much as the actual hardware. </s>
<s> I am a little confused by your post's title though, because I monitor the memory usage when my programme runs and I have never run out of memory. </s>
<s> So will more RAM still be helpful in that situation? </s>
<s> My work, works well on laptops. </s>
<s> Over the past decade I've moved from Compaq R3000 with AMD 64 2GHz single core to HP AMD dv6000 x2 Turion to HP dv6 core2duo to what I use today which is a Dell i15r 2646MRB with Intel's i5 6GB RAM and more. </s>
<s> Each has been a nice step up. </s>
<s> I knew not to go to the i7 for a laptop so I wait for the next advance before I consider anything more powerful. </s>
<s> The Dell was only 749 and my only quibble is the LCD is barely acceptable but for the price it's quite a deal. </s>
<s> -&gt; I have this computationally intensive app I wrote that sifts through some 4 billion number sets and it completes in 10 or so minutes. </s>
<s> For me, this is fast enough. </s>
<s> If the i7 is out of the budget, the i5 is quite nice. </s>
<s> My core2duo took about twice as long. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The statement RAM adds speed is disproved many times. </s>
<s> Mind you that those with scientific or math routines to run are the ones that can dish it out on that statement. </s>
<s> On my Dell I can unplug 2GB and my 4 billion sifting app completes in exactly the amount of time it did with 2GB more. </s>
<s> For me this is proof the RAM does not add speed. </s>
<s> Also, if HIBERNATE my 4GB setup, hibernation completes many seconds sooner and it wakes up faster with less RAM. </s>
<s> Wow, what goes here? </s>
<s> Less RAM is faster? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> A system will fall back on &quot;virtual memory&quot; using the HD as if ram. </s>
<s> So, you may not see this as a factor or more so. </s>
<s> I suggeted getting the best cpu NOW rather than later as that's a major cost of a new system. </s>
<s> The ram usually is capable, say you get 4gb for starters, you can add later if the need arises. </s>
<s> I'm sure that's more than your current old PC. </s>
<s> I would also like to add the benefits of X86-64bit OS, which leads me to think you're using a 32-bit version of OS. </s>
<s> The 64-bit version will better handle mutiple core cpus and/or make use of it, BUT the s/w should be ready for such, is it? </s>
<s> If your s/w is 64-bit capable even though though 32-bit will run it may find a better world with 64-bit, however I don't get into s/w matters that much any more, other than reading the details of it. </s>
<s> Further as I already stated check with vendors what they offer in details/specs and you can upgrade abit when you build and get better system as that's open to you. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I appreciate all your replies. </s>
<s> The points are clear. </s>
<s> I'll start looking around and checking with the big vendors (lots of work to do). </s>
