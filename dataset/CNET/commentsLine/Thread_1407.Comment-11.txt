article says double-click ide ata/atapi controllers to display the list of controllers and channels and right-click the icon for the channel to which the device is connected, select properties, and then click the advanced settings tab.
i may be going blind - but where on earth is the &quot;advanced settings&quot; tab i have selected the channel to which my raptor drive is connected but there is no such tab!
i have driver, details, resources, general, primary channel and secondary channel tabs
