that series of barton's.
first documented in the model 8 spec's.
i have a copy of the model 10 data sheet.
all of the design type documents are available as pdf downloads from amd and intel.
the 2600 barton model 8 [333mhz] showed a frequency 0f 2088 mhz where the thoroughbred model 8 2600+ [same name] was 2133. now the model 10 barton [2500+]the model 10 shows 2133. not sure but i think the model 10 vs model 8 is a different width artwork.
i have the entire pdf on the computer, only printed oiut a couple of key pages.
maximum model 10 2500+ power consumption is 68.3 watts, typicsl 53.2.
