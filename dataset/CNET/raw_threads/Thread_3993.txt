3	0	500685	5002342	NR	CarloMas	10/4/10 11:53 AM	1.28619318E12	Please Recommend External Hard Drive	I?m looking for a cheap external hard drive, about 1TB. My PC is a Dell Dimension E521 (desktop) (32 bit operating system running Vista Home Premium). I believe my only connection option for this sort of thing is USB 2.0. I?ve seen a number of drives at Amazon and for about $80, but about half the customer reviews say they fail in a few months to a year. I have nothing vital but stuff that would be very inconvenient to have to replace. They?re mostly audio and video files that I?d like to be able to play while they?re on the external drive, rather than having to copy them to the PC?s internal hard drive first. Another thing I?ve noticed is some don?t have an on/off switch. Is this something that can be left on all the time (like my DSL modem), or would that make it fail faster? Is there any product you can recommend? Thanks in advance.

For any disk or computer part you buy you will see some negative reviews. There is no perfect product line so just try to select a manufacturer that is considered good and minimize the possibility of a faulty product. Good Luck! Socrates
