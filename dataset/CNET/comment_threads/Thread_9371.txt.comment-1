I bought these some 6 years ago and never had a single problem.
A couple of months ago bought new Dell computer and just connected them and they sound better than ever.
I noticed, however, over the last couple of days I can hear this very annoying squeak coming out of them ... volume is turned right down ... what could be causing this?
Help!
Thanks!
