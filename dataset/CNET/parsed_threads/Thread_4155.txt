<s> For no apparent reason, after my 1150 has been on for awhile, the power source changes from AC to battery with no warning. </s>
<s> The laptop is not being moved or jostled at all when this happens. </s>
<s> Can anyone give me a clue as to why this is happening and what I can do about it? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Even moderate bumps or pulls on the power connection can cause cracks or failures there. </s>
<s> It does not matter that you didn't move the connection or laptop since failures run the map and we can't see the parts involved. </s>
<s> If it's the usual, a good technician can reflow the solder and maybe clear up the problem. </s>
<s> In closing, the number of laptops I see transported with the power cord connected makes me think that this problem is widespread. </s>
