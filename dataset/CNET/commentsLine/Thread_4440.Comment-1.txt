i am a victim of sporadic system instability, ranging from blue screens, to desktop hangs to file system/windows corruption.
i'll fix one thing, and everything will be fine for weeks to months, and then some other problem arises.
i think it's something to do with the ide bus, because sometimes an ide device won't be detected during boot, or post won't get beyond &quot;detecting ide devices&quot;.
i've run diagnostics on memory and disk drives, replaced a disc drive (i try to run 2 western digital 200 gb caviar drives and a seagate 200gb barracuda) and upgraded bios on everything i could), just installed a new mobo (asus a8n5x), went to an atx case with 3 fans, and just today i got a blue screen &quot;a process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited&quot; when i tried to add the wd drive to a simplified seagate/hp 840i dvd writer ide chain.
i'm plunking down big $$ to get an antec 550w powersupply today.
has anyone ever heard of a defective ide device ruining another ide device?
am i asking for trouble with 4 ide devices in my box?
- if so, will replacing one ide drive with a sata relieve the strain?
