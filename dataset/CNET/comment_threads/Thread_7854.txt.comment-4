They are certainly better than nothing.
The plain fact any help in keeping a laptop cooler is a plus.
Unfortantly not much is out there, while coolers are simple, they do the job.
Simply evalating the rear laptop case to expose to airflow is a plus.
You can help keep it cooler by &quot;throtting down&quot; the cpu even when used as a safe bet, then throttle up when really required.
good luck -----Willy
