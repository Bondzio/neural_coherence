im gonna tell it like it is here when it comes to my problem.
i live in philadelphia and i have access to over a dozen or so wireless connections from my living room.
im not 'stealing' in the respect that im breaking the law since the ones im using are meant to be for free (they're named 'free2use#1' and such).
ive been using these connections in my living room for months now, downloading and watching movies with my girlfriend instantly on netflix without problems.
lately though connections sever more and more regularly and connections that have always been strong and regular are now weaker.
for instance the roofing business 4 doors down was once 4 bars and now is barely 1 nowadays.
i know the owner and have talked to him about it.
his connection is fine, they have not moved any equipment so it must be my computer.
i downloaded the updated networking driver for windows xp and it did nothing to change my situation.
i am using windows xp home edition with an intel(r) pro/wireless 3945abg net network adapter to connect to the internet.
suggestions?
help?
please!!?!
thanks.
