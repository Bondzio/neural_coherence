<s> One minute I connect a jumpe drive, no problem 5 minutes later put the jump drive back in and &quot;USB device not recognized&quot;. </s>
<s> Same with MP3, external hard drives, etc. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> Thought it had something to do with MTP that my MP3 uses but umm no that's not it. </s>
<s> Thought it was the Belkin wireless adapter utility but umm nope that's not it. </s>
<s> I have XP Pro and any and all updates installed. </s>
<s> Latest updates I can find for Intel Chipset 875P etc. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> Bought a new hard drive re-installed a fresh copy of XP Pro. </s>
<s> Everything running along smooth and then boom back to the same problem I have had a few times in the past six months. </s>
<s> Is the motherboard going bad? </s>
<s> the Serial Bus Controller? </s>
<s> Thought it was just me but have found several similiar stories while searching for a solution on line. </s>
<s> Problem is I can only find the problem but not a solution. </s>
<s> Anyone have THE answer? </s>
<s> Unplug all USB devices. </s>
<s> Open up the device manager. </s>
<s> Click on the symbol next to ''Universal Serial Bus Controllers'' to expand it. </s>
<s> Right-click on each item in the list and select ''Uninstall''. </s>
<s> Once all items listed under ''Universal Serial Bus Controllers'' have been uninstalled; restart the system My only hope is that someone has an answer other then your motherboard is about shot! </s>
<s> FYI The previous mentioned steps have solved the problem this time acutally but pretty sure it won't last which makes me think even more that it is the motherboard. </s>
<s> And yes I know so far I have been talking to myself. </s>
