Firstly, can someone suggest a decent motherboard with intel 775 socket and 1066Mhz FSB that would do the job. Looking at around $150 US (&lt;$200 AUS would be good) Secondly, is there any need for a graphics card with the integrated graphics included with the motherboard and what is a good card to go for? Cheers, Alex

Proffitt	3/30/08 6:00 AM	1.2068568E12	AUS	Sorry I'm not there but if you want top CPU performance and not worried about 3D gaming even the lowest end video card (current models please) will do fine. One of our best video editing machines (stable, fast, etc) had a 4MB video card. Bob

(dual monitors are great for the type of work you mentioned.) so, i suggest you get an inexpensive graphics card based on either the nvidia geforce 8400gs or the ati radeon hd 2400pro. motherboards, $90-$115 USD: GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L MSI P35 Neo2-FR graphics, $40 USD: MSI NX8400GS-TD256EH GeForce 8400GS GIGABYTE GV-NX84G256HE GeForce 8400GS MSI RX2400PRO-TD256EH Radeon HD 2400PRO
