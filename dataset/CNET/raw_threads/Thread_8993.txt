Sadly this is not true with Windows machines. -&gt; Since such is free, why would we go without protection? Bob

I am wondering, if the laptops and or the itouch is used away from the s-link device, how do I run an antivirus on these portable computers.. if its possible. I am assuming I can: disable the antivirus when I'm connected to the network, and enable the antivirus when I'm away. is this posible,

Note that: -&gt; The firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device. Otherwise, you're not protected. -&gt; The antivirus protection from McAfee must be installed on each computer. That will work even when your computers are not connected to that device. -&gt; You should never disable your antivirus protection, even when connected to that device. -&gt; You should always use a firewall...you need to install a software firewall for use when you're away from the D-Link device.
