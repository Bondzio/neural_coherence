1.1.1	I was attempting to help my friend with his computer problems ... he has a dell desktop , not sure what model , but I do n't believe that is relevant in this case .	St
1.1.2	He was n't sure when it happened , but he thought it might have been when he uninstalled DVD43 .	St
1.1.3	Under My Computer , both his CDRW ( sony crx216e ) and DVDRW ( pioneer dvr-110d ) drives were missing .	St
1.1.4	After going into Device Manager , it showed both drives , but they both had yellow exclamation points next to it .	St
1.1.5	First step was to uninstall the drives , and reboot windows .	St
1.1.6	Same problem .	St
1.1.7	The drives showed up under Device Manager with the yellow exclamation point .	St
1.1.8	Second , I attempted to update the drivers ( found at each respective company 's website ) .	St
1.1.9	When installing the drivers , an error came up for both of them saying & quot ; available target not found. & quot ; After that , I tried to Rollback the drivers , but it said something along the lines that there was no previous driver installed .	St
1.1.10	I considered using system restore , but he is n't sure when the problem started happening , and I do n't want to restore it too far back because I 'm not sure if that will harm anything else he 's done since the problem occurred .	St
1.1.11	Also , in another form someone mentioned that a system restore did not help them .	St
1.1.12	I attempted to look into the BIOS , but Dell 's bios is nothing like mine , and barely has any options .	St
1.1.13	I 've searched through multiple forums , but to no avail .	St
1.1.14	One mentioned going into the registry and editing a few things , then uninstalling the drives and rebooting , but I am a bit nervous editing the registry on a computer that is not mine .	St
1.2.1	Noted and linked at http : //forum.aumha.org/viewtopic.php ? p=128113 & sid=ca56a6d141f6f7b8e75b458ae13785c1	St
1.3.1	I looked over that forum , but I do n't see where that relates to my problem .	St
1.3.2	That forum seems to be about drives that are recognized , but do not recognize a CD-RW .	St
1.3.3	Maybe I am missing something , could you specify which post on that forum describes a solution to my problem ?	Ques
1.4.1	http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/314060 dont worry about too much about editing the registry , as long as you follow the instructions right it will be fine , besides you can back it up before changing/deleting , it may make some installed burnning software to malfunction if it have an upper/lower filter driver but thats all , nothing beyond , if that will happen its very easy to uninstall and reinstall that specific software .	St
1.5.1	That looks exactly like what I 've read in the other forums ...	St
1.5.2	I was hoping there would be a fix without a regedit , but I 'll just back up his registry before I do anything .	St
1.5.3	I 'll give it a shot and repost the results later tonight .	St
1.6.1	Do n't want to use regedit .	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thank you all for the fast help ...	St
1.7.2	I followed Stephen471 's advice and everything is back in order .	St
