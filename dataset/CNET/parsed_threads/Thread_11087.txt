<s> I have bought a new 160 GB SATA Seagate HDD and I already use a 40 GB PATA samsung HDD. </s>
<s> After I add the new SATA to my PC will there be any compatibility issues between the two disks? </s>
<s> Any booting delays etc? </s>
<s> Can anyone shed some light on this??? </s>
<s> My motherboard supports both SATA and PATA HDD's, Intel D101GGc is the model. </s>
<s> All I can offer is that I had to tinker with the BIOS and add a driver to the OS. </s>
<s> Sadly what I did doesn't apply to all other PCs. </s>
<s> There is or was not compatibility issue but there definitely is a issue with how well they document this. </s>

<s> and as far as compatibility goes, you problaly won't notice a thing especially both uses as an internal drives. </s>
<s> Thanks guys... </s>
<s> Even I hope there is no issues as such....Am planning to use the new SATA as the master and the present PATA 40 GB as the slave. </s>
<s> Hope everything goes fine. </s>
<s> Read our XP forum you find many posts about people having difficulty installing XP to SATA drives. </s>
<s> Thankfully there are now thousands of articles HOW TO on google. </s>

<s> You should have said that in your opening post, that way you would have got the right information to start with. </s>
<s> As Bob said adding a hdd and adding & changing it for boot drive, is not the same thing. </s>
<s> and your PATA should still be master if nothing has been change. </s>
<s> Your sata are actually a SCSI device. </s>
<s> Make sure to change the boot sequence if that will be your OS drive. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input guys...the help here has been wonderful.....:-) </s>
