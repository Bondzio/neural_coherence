<s> I'm looking for a good tablet less than $200. </s>
<s> I have been researching on the internet; I have an iPod touch 5g, and was looking at some ipad models, but they are too expensive. </s>
<s> I see the blackberry playbook is under $150, and looks to have favorable reviews. </s>
<s> I would be a casual user, using it for web browsing, etc., so 16gb would be fine for me. </s>
<s> Besides performance, apps running smooth, etc., the most important feature to me is battery life. </s>
<s> I hear the playbook may not have the best. </s>
<s> The office picked up a Transformer with the dock and it can hit 14+ hours on a full charge. </s>
<s> Very nice. </s>
<s> But that playbook would have me install Android. </s>
