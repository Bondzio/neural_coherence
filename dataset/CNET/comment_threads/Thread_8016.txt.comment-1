My &quot;Lite-ON DVD writer/rewriter super allwrite (LH-20A1P)&quot; drive is not working properly.
It can read or write CDs but it is unable to read or write DVDs.
So I want to know what's happened with it?
I've also tried updating the firmware,but it didn't work (now the drive can read few DVDs not all the DVDs).
So please help.
my OS: win XP , DVD writer: LH-20A1P487C
