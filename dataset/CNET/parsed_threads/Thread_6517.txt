<s> I know very little about this area and think my questions are stupid, but I don't want to mess anything up so I have to ask them. </s>
<s> My 5 year old Linksys router (WRT54G) is dying a slow death (regarding laptops picking up the wireless connection) and I'm replacing it with a new router (WRT54G2). </s>
<s> My desktop computer (Dell Inspiron 1720) is running Windows Vista Home Premium (32 bit) and I have a DSL modem. </s>
<s> My question concerns unhooking the old router and hooking up the new router. </s>
<s> What are the steps? </s>
<s> Should the computer be on or off when unhooking and re-hooking? </s>
<s> Is it advisable to turn off the firewall during this process (I'm using the latest version of Comodo's firewall)? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Power off the PC, modem, and router. </s>
<s> Replace router. </s>
<s> Power on, in this order: Modem (wait for lights to normalize), router (wait again), PC. </s>
<s> Configure router. </s>
<s> Thanks Coryphaeus, that was helpful. </s>
<s> I have a follow up question. </s>
<s> The salesperson at Best Buy told me I can use the included CD to guide me through setup. </s>
<s> Is this necessary? </s>
<s> Can I just type 192.168.1.1 and go through the tabs to mark the new settings the same as what the old settings were? </s>
<s> The setup CD is for the newbie. </s>
<s> Just be sure to configure your security, WPA/WPA2. </s>
<s> After you're done, save the configuration to your hard drive as a backup. </s>
<s> You may need it if you ever do a firmware update. </s>
<s> After you do an update the backup will put your settings back and you don't have to configure it again. </s>
