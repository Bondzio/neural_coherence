Just went to turn my system on this morning, and it will not boot!
It has been running great, and I have added no new software or hardware for awhile.
When I turn on the computer, the XP logo splashes up, then I get a message about Windows not starting correctly.
However, I am not able to use my keyboard (USB) at all to select an option.
On the front of my computer (Dell Dimension 2400), there is a green light that keeps flashing to the right of the power button.
Any suggestions on what I could try?
Thanks!
L.T.
