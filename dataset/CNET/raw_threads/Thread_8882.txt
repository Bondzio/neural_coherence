The problem I will describe in the next paragraph is present on both monitors but much more noticeable LCD. I have tried the LCD monitor on 4 different computer (Laptops and Desktops) with different hardware and the problem present with all so I am pretty sure it is the monitor not the hardware configuration. PROBLEM: When viewing text some of the letters appear redish, greenish or grayish. The redish hue is very apparent in a word which contains double letters like &quot;ii&quot; or &quot;ll&quot;. The smaller the font the more noticible the discolorations. Since I do a lot of wordprocessing and spreadsheet work, I am considering returning the monitor. Has anyone else noticed this problem with Viewsonic or any other brand of monitor? I am wondering if it is just a charactertic of the Viewsonic monitors. My husband uses a Sony 19&quot; LCD which has a clear crisp display regardless of how large or small the text is. Unfortunately I can't really afford the cost of a Sony.

I do and have found some difficulty in adjusting my Viewsonic CRT for a perfect edge to edge picture when looking directly in the middle. I see some color distortion toward the edges which disappears when I move or turn my head. Keeping it degaussed helps but isn't perfect. I do get some color distortion my laptop's LCD screen as well. It also lessens depending on my viewing position. I suspect glasses cause some subtle color distortion when light is refracted and the color spectrum components separate.
