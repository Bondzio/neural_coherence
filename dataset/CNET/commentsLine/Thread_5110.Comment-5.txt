overnight, computers at our house get shut down.
for a couple of hours, they are probably left on.
for a laptop or desktop not on a vpn, i would let it sleep.
however, if my desktop or laptop are connected to my work vpn (a pain to manually reconnect to), i would just leave them on, no sleeping or hibernating.
then they'll stay connected to the vpn, although they might need to do an automatic reconnect depending on how long it's been.
so there's no one answer for me, whatever makes more sense given the situation is what i'll do *smile*.
but off overnight, definitely.
