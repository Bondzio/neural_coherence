How can running anti virus software do this?
when it's not an issue on any other machine (all have AVG).
Also I've quick tuned before with no problem?
It doesn't answer why it could connect to BT wifi but not to Virgin.
I don't understand what you mean by registry entries?
I've already spent 3 days googling.
What I Was hoping was that someone would be able to advice me on my situation.
I'm not a tech whizz.
