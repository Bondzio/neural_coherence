<s> I am using a HP deskjet Model 3745 on my home computer network. </s>
<s> 2 PCs are connected. </s>
<s> Both using Windows Millenium with all patches etc., up to date. </s>
<s> PC1:-First machine config: P4 2.0Ghz, 128Mb ram, 40Gb HDD, 52X Cdwriter, FDD, 15'' monitor. </s>
<s> PC2:-Second machine Config: Celeron 1Ghz, 128Mb ram, 40Gb HDD, FDD, 15'' monitor. </s>
<s> Both are connected directly. </s>
<s> The printer is connected through USB port of PC1 and mapped to PC2 Printing is perfect from PC1 but when printing from PC2 it prints in brown / dark red color even though I have enabled ''print in grey scale - use black cartridge'' in the printer option. </s>
<s> This happens at random. </s>
<s> I have no idea when it will print properly. </s>
<s> I print legal documents on stamp paper and it becomes a total waste if the printout comes out in red/ brown!! </s>
<s> ''Hp support'' says that they cannot guarantee proper printouts on the network as it is on USB Port ?? </s>
<s> This problem happened with Main PC where the printer is connected for which the advise has been Reinstall the driver as the driver may be corrupt. </s>
<s> Fact is this printer is in use for the last 3 months with no problems but suddenly it has become un-usable. </s>
<s> there have been no system crashes, both PCs are on UPS, anti virus, spyware, ets., are all up to date ! </s>
<s> Please help !!! </s>
<s> ** Last time I reinsatlled the driver (24/9/2005) it gave an error message insufficient memory (120 Mb) but allowed me to complete the install. </s>
<s> Could this be the problem ? </s>
<s> But the same has worked for last 3 months. </s>
<s> The DOS based Windows such as 95/98/ME all have a nasty 64 kilobyte memory pool that when it runs dry could cause a report like &quot;This happens at random. </s>
<s> I have no idea when it will print properly. </s>
<s> I print legal documents on stamp paper and it becomes a total waste if the printout comes out in red/ brown! </s>
<s> !&quot; There is no fix planned. </s>
<s> This OS is from an era of computing where we accepted we would have to reboot every few hours and &quot;not do too much.&quot; Try this. </s>
<s> Reboot to free up resources at the beginning of the process. </s>
<s> If there is a print server on one of these older OSes, reboot it first. </s>
<s> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but no fix is planned and HP may not offer any education about this old issue. </s>
<s> Here's a link to articles about memory use and optimizing this old Windows: http://aumha.org/articles.php Worth noting is a &quot;complex&quot; printout could trigger this as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thankyou for your brief. </s>
<s> I was previously using HP 640C desk jet printer on the parallel port and for 3 years there were no such problems. </s>
<s> This printer also is 3 months old for last 2 1/2 months worked perfectly well. </s>
<s> There are no multiple programs running. </s>
<s> Only MS Word 2000 to draft the document and then print. </s>
<s> HP support says &quot; In USB port printer they cannot guarantee printouts from the client PC ? </s>
<s> ?&quot; So I am not sure if this is a memory problem. </s>
<s> Also this system is used only for drafting legal documents and no additional programs or TSRs are running except AVG anti virus and Zone Alarm. </s>
<s> There has been no additional programs loaded. </s>
<s> As per HP support suggesstion driver was uninstalled and reinstalled and it worked for 3-4 days. </s>
<s> Now back to the same problem. </s>
<s> Could it be a problem with the printer itself ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Hi!, I am getting the same problem. </s>
<s> Reasion I concluded is your main computer to which the printer is attached is using colour cartriage when take colour print, and uses black and white cartriage when u use black and white print, but nothing is like this with other computer on network. </s>
<s> The other computer on network always uses the colour cartriage, even if u select grayscale-black&white option, and the fact is your colour cartriage is about to empty. </s>
<s> Just refill your colour cartraige u will get rid of this problem. </s>
<s> U have only 2 systems on your network so don't have much problem but I have 15 systems so I am having a bit problem. </s>
<s> All computers except one is using the colour cartriage. </s>
<s> Thus colour cartriage is getting emply early. </s>
<s> If any body have solution of this problem kindly advice. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance... msnegi98 </s>
<s> You claim it worked before, but I see more people installing more software such as firewall on these DOS based OS's and not realize the extra load will cause new issues. </s>
<s> You changed the setup so have to rethink the cause. </s>
<s> There is a reason why this old OS is fading away. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In my experience this happens when the account printing does not have admin rights on the PC that the printer is installed on. </s>
<s> Try it with 2 accounts on the same PC (remove the colour cart) and try forcing it to black. </s>
<s> You will find that if you dont have admin privileges in uses the colour cartage no matter what. </s>
<s> I dont consider sticking users in a local admin group so they can print, a valid fix but it might help you. </s>
<s> Only in NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista does the concept of security and admin accounts start to show. </s>
