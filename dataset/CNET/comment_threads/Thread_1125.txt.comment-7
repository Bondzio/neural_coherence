Wouldn't be easier and cheaper to buy another Ethernet adapter for my desktop computer, connect it to the cable modem and use the other to connect directly to my laptop?
Or to buy a hub and connect all devices to it?
Would it work with XP's Internet Connection Sharing?
I only need this solution for a short time, it would be a temporary.
