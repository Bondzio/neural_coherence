<s> i'm looking to upgrade my current pc (733mhz p3) which i purchased from dell about 5 years ago...i can't afford a whole new system so i'm going to replace the motherboard, cpu and memory for now and replace other components as $ permits... here is what i'm looking at now: MB: ASUS &quot;P4C800-E DELUXE&quot; i875P Chipset Motherboard for Intel Socket 478 CPU CPU: Intel Pentium 4/ 3.2E GHz 800MHz FSB, 1MB L2 Cache, Hyper Threading Technology RAM: Corsair Value Select 184 Pin 512MB DDR PC-3200 i'll also be upgrading to windows xp(from 98se). </s>
<s> with the exception of HD's/optical drives everything else is the same as when i got it 5 years ago...am i missing anything??? </s>
<s> comments?? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> You will need a much larger power supply and plenty of cooling. </s>
<s> I'll guess the MB, processor and RAM will cost you close to $500 alone. </s>
<s> You might through in another 100 for a halfway decent case with some breathing room and PS over 400w. </s>
<s> If you want to do more than spreadsheets, web browsing and such, you might want more RAM but XP will run ok with 512 megs. </s>
<s> Your Dell box might not fit the MB anyway. </s>
<s> Have you checked into this? </s>
<s> i figured the power supply would be an issue (the current one is 300-350 i think) an suggestions as far a brand?? </s>
<s> i assumed that as long as they were the same form factor that it should fit...i'll have to look into this... thanks </s>
<s> If it was really a 350, but after a year or two, the power supply capacity is a mere shadow of when it was new. </s>
<s> There are many articles about this so do not dismiss that its enough. </s>
