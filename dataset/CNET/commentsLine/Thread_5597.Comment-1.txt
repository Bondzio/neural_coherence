i have a wireless network in my house.
my speeds seem to fluctuate greatly.
this is not a question about interenet speed.
i live in the country and i know my isp is sub par out here.
i am talking about data transfer across the network to my storage.
i am using a cisco e4200 storage router with a 2tb drive attached.
from the same location in the house using the same computer, my speed ranges from 200kb/s to 2mb/s.
i realize the speed is very slow for the router's specs, but that could be a distance,signal strength issue.
shouldn't my speed be pretty consistent from that location though?
what could cause such a large speed disparity?
