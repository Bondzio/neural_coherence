I had this problem just minutes before I posted this.
I've just plugged in my thumb drive to my computer, to save some document into it.
This thumb drive contains all the work I've done for my 4 weeks of tertiary education (today is the 4th week of school in fact) When I attempt to open the thumb drive, instead of the folder that contains all of my data for school work, I see WEIRD files I've never seen before.
And the file type: File.
Am still shocked by the matter.
I've just plugged in the thumb drive in another computer moments ago.
No virus whatsoever detected in that computer.
And now, the other computer where I found the problem give me plenty of, i would say, crap.
Is there a way to fix this thumb drive problem?
