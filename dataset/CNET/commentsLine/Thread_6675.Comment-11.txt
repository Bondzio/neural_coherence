finding it, might be a big problem.
apparently, microsoft left it out of vista deliberately, and the (rather unknown) manufacturer might not have enough reason or resources to write one.
the best thing to do might be to contact microsoft.
they are doing their utmost best to make vista as compatible with older os'es as possible (there are still much too much people who don't want vista for reasons like this) and they might be able to help you.
best of luck and let us know.
