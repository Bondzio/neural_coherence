i got my first pc in 1993. it was an intel 486 dx2-66, it had 16meg of ram, a 512meg hd, a 15&quot; monitor, i added a video card with 8meg vram and a 16k modem for internet access.
it was a full tower case.
i upgraded it several times before they quit making the at format mbs.
the last incarnation it went through was an amd k6-2 500, with 64meg ram and 30g hd, as well as an onboard dsl modem.
i now have an amd sempron 2500+ with 1gig of ram and the video has 64meg which is ample at this time.
