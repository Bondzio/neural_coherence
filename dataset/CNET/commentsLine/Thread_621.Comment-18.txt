if it worked before and only ram was changed and now no video, then return old ram into system.
if the problem persists then somehow the video got disconnected, inspect closely.
once that's resolved, return new ram back in.
yes, the beeps refer to a bios error code, find out wht it means to your system, but since no video it pretty much narrows it down.
if the ram you brought was the proper type&class for your system, then it should work once installed properly.
though you mentioned that you rehecked your work, sometimes the little things do get by, &quot;don't take anything for granted&quot;.
