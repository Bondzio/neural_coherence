I set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display.
Now I get a black screen every time I try and turn on my computer.
I don't get the usual boot up screen either.
I can boot up when I connect to the motherboard, but not when I use my graphics card.
Is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution?
