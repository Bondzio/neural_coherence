<s> I had this problem just minutes before I posted this. </s>
<s> I've just plugged in my thumb drive to my computer, to save some document into it. </s>
<s> This thumb drive contains all the work I've done for my 4 weeks of tertiary education (today is the 4th week of school in fact) When I attempt to open the thumb drive, instead of the folder that contains all of my data for school work, I see WEIRD files I've never seen before. </s>
<s> And the file type: File. </s>
<s> Am still shocked by the matter. </s>
<s> I've just plugged in the thumb drive in another computer moments ago. </s>
<s> No virus whatsoever detected in that computer. </s>
<s> And now, the other computer where I found the problem give me plenty of, i would say, crap. </s>
<s> Is there a way to fix this thumb drive problem? </s>
<s> The thumb drive data may have been corrupted. </s>
<s> The modified dates of all the &quot;File&quot; type files are around 2079/2080! </s>
<s> And further more, I've found that the File System is FAT32, not the usual NTFS! </s>
<s> Any solutions? </s>
<s> I usually edit a copy on the hard disk and copy to the drive. </s>
<s> I'm sure that many might edit such on said drive but that seems to push one's luck as these devices have limited lifespans which I can easily multiply by using it my way. </s>
<s> So the solution is simple. </s>
<s> Format the thumb drive and copy your files back on to it. </s>

<s> It's only a week old. </s>
<s> The latest ones contain reports that I've already handed up this week. </s>
<s> Though it's not really a problem, it's quite a bother having to download notes from an e-learning website my school had provided. </s>
<s> Sounds to me you should exchange it. </s>

<s> It's one of my old thumb drives which are 3 years old or older. </s>
<s> But I guess, once the data's gone, it's gone. </s>
<s> No enzrypting whatsoever can undo it. </s>
<s> All such devices will eventually fail. </s>
<s> The flash chip inside has a limited number of erase cycles and once used up you see odd things happen. </s>
<s> You ask if it's fixable but let me assure you that while repair is possible (change the flash chip) the cost is quite high compared to a new stick. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Consider yourself lucky that you have anything. </s>
<s> I found some of the cheap flash drives not worth keeping after 1yr. </s>
<s> (they die much sooner) they simply crap out. </s>
<s> However, name brands do well and if you get a high quality one, then at least it should serve you until you're done with it. </s>
<s> Be aware that &quot;static/ESD&quot; is very much part of the shorten life cycle of a flash drive, ground yourself or your flash drive becomes the flash point(no pun intended) to discharge static. </s>
