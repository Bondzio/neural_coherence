i bought a xfx 6600gt card (to replace a ti4200 that was failing with increased frquency) and placed in my abit kg7 mb.
updated bios and northbridge drivers and thoroughly cleaned the ti4200 nvidia drivers.
new board works until i try to play video using windows media player (video all green) or games like battlefield 1942 or half life2, where the graphics are viewable but messed up (color and images).
i tried the latest nvidia drivers and now the video goes black when the windows desktop loads.
any suggestions?
