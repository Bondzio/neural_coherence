1.1.1	I just wanted to mention that I was so upset about the teck support at Dell I wrote a letter on 1/20/05 and I received a call from the head office today .	St
1.1.2	He was very nice and I told him there were many many customers who are unhapply about the support .	St
1.1.3	He said he wished more people let him know about a problem with the support so they know where they stand .	St
1.1.4	I am only posting this to suggest that anyone who has had problems write a letter so they are aware of how many customers are/were dissatisfied .	St
1.1.5	Sandra	St
1.2.1	i should complain online i liek lost connection with tech support person and stuffz and it takes a hour for them to answer phone	St
1.3.1	Well maybe you should post his name and I 'm sure he will get lots of responces .	Sug
1.3.2	John	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the advice , shylaugh .	St
1.4.2	An attorney friend recommended I send a registered letter to Dell , and explain that I do not want them to call me at work .	St
1.4.3	( My payments always seem to be late , even though I mail them WAY in advance . )	St
1.4.4	So today I am writing my letter and asking that they contact me in writing in the future .	St
1.4.5	Once they receive my letter , if they again call me at work I will have a legal case against their harassment .	St
1.4.6	Would you mind sharing the address where you sent your letter ?	Ques
1.4.7	They have so many addresses , I do n't know where to send it .	St
1.4.8	Thanks much !	St

1.5.1	I also had a very bad experience with the Dell home ( consumer ) business model of only providing poorly trained , outsourced technical & customer NO service .	St
1.5.2	I also wrote a letter to the corp. office in TX , as well as returned the PC for exchange ( 21 day return policy ) .	St
1.5.3	I received a call a week or so later .	St
1.5.4	The gentleman similarly stated that he wished more people would file formal complaints so Dell corp. would listen .	St
1.5.5	Enough business customers complained about the poor quality of the outsourced customer & technical NO service that Dell was forced to return part or all support to the USA ( for USA business sales ) .	St
1.5.6	Until Dell changes their business model for home ( consumer support ) they have lost me as a long time business and home customer .	St
1.5.7	This is only my opinion and judging by the response here and other avenues , this is an opinion shared by many .	St
1.5.8	If your experience with Dell was negative , I would encourage you to file a formal complaint with Dell corp. : Dell Corporate Headquarters : Dell Inc. One Dell Way Round Rock , Texas 78682 United States If your experience was bad enough , you may also want to consider filing a complaint with the BBB ( BBB.org ) , filing a complaint with your states Attorney Generals office , as well as joining the class-action law suit against Dell .	St
1.5.9	Conversely , if you had a positive experience and feel so inclined , you may want to express it to Dell via the same means .	St
1.6.1	Good info and advice Driftwood .	Sug
1.6.2	The same should also apply to other big producers like HP and Gateway since reading about complaints on them .	Sug
1.7.1	I find it very hard to believe that anyone could & quot ; not know & quot ; how bad things are ... however I do believe that writing directly to the company can help .	St
1.7.2	Since most disatisfied consumers do n't take the time to complain in writing , each letter counts for a lot more than just one complaint .	St
1.7.3	( In government they usually count & quot ; 10,000 complaints & quot ; per letter , since they are assuming that only one in ten-thousand will complain in writing . )	St
1.7.4	I fully agree that & quot ; any company & quot ; which provides crappy service should & quot ; hear & quot ; about it .	St
1.7.5	Call , write letters , send email , write posts in various forums , lodge formal complaints ... and keep it up until they either do the right thing or go out of business from lost sales due to loss of reputation .	St
1.7.6	Sincerely , JDM	St
1.8.1	Is that how the Canadian Government counts complaints ?	Ques
1.8.2	I worked more than 20 years in the US Government and never heard of that .	St
1.9.1	that & quot ; I 'm Canadian , and proud ! & quot ; ... but that would be a fib , John !	St
1.9.2	However , as far as I know , that is how they count letters up here ( at least at the federal level ) .	St
1.9.3	It 's also the way they count letters in several state and federal departments .	St
1.9.4	( I thought & quot ; civics & quot ; was a required subject when you went to school ... ) I do n't believe there are any hard and fast rules as to how many & quot ; points & quot ; each letter counts for ( 10,000 seems to be a & quot ; standard & quot ; number ) ... but they do count for a lot more than one letter .	St
1.9.5	And , as I 've said , it depends on the department and/or organization .	St
1.9.6	Personally , I believe there are certain segments of government that would n't care how many letters we wrote .	St
1.9.7	( You were n't by any chance a postman ... were you , John ? )	Ques
1.10.1	By the way , John ... what made you choose Monarch , and how 's that working out for you ?	Ques
1.10.2	Sincerely , JDM	St
