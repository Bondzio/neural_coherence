Looking at you motherboard's model and features, it shows a cmedia 9880 audio device and plugging that into google to look for a driver comes up with http://www.opendrivers.com/driver/219895/ecs-c-media-9880-azalia-audio-driver-v5.12.01.0007.36-windows-free-download.html which mentions the azalia selection in BIOS you said never worked.
Well, maybe it never had the correct driver.
I wonder, as well, if before the reformat/re-installation you didn't have some sort of console to enable or configure various audio outputs.
Perhaps the front and rears have separate circuitry rather than being physically connected.
Such would make sense because plugging speaker jacks into both at the same time could cause impedance problems.
Just a thought.
