Article says Double-click IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers to display the list of controllers and channels and right-click the icon for the channel to which the device is connected, select Properties, and then click the Advanced Settings tab.
I may be going blind - but where on earth is the &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; tab I have selected the channel to which my Raptor drive is connected but there is no such tab!
I have Driver, Details, Resources, General, Primary Channel and Secondary Channel tabs
