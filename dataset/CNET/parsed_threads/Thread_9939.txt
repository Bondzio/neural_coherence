<s> I recently purchased a new Passport and have a question. </s>
<s> I accidentally backed up my entire C:\ Drive. </s>
<s> I went back in to delete everything I don't need backed up and it appears I have to delete each file one by one (which will take a long time). </s>
<s> Is there a way delete entire folders? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I think DMaeler(sp?). </s>
<s> BTW, is there any difference between backing up my entire C:\Drive to the Passport and a Norton Ghost recovery point? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Sorry, I don't know the WD Software. </s>
<s> Maybe somebody else does. </s>
<s> If it's all combined in one Windows file, can't you delete that and start all over. </s>
<s> This is one of the risks of using proprietary backup software. </s>
<s> It might use a proprietary lay-out for the data that it backs up, so the usual Windows tools don't work on it. </s>
<s> Your choice to use it. </s>

<s> I have Norton and have heard good and bad things about Acronis. </s>
<s> I like having a backup of my files in case I lose something and an entire system backup in case my HD takes a dump. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
