I have an Emachiene T5212 ( http://reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T5212/4507-3118_7-32085027.html?tag=sub ) and the specs say it has a max Video RAM of 128MB. I was hoping to put in a direct x10 video card, but now it doesnt seam to be possiable. My question is, can I add 2 video cards each having 128MB or can my computer only handle a total od 128MB, and does anyone have any suggestions on a good card. Thanks!!!!!!

Dual video board is not possible as far as I can see. but dx10 is possible; look at some of the pci-express board above $300. I think some of them have dx10 support. http://www.mwave.com/mwave/viewspec.hmx?scriteria=3000752

(The pci-express video card will override your built-in video.) The main contstraint is your power supply. Its power rating is not listed in the PC's specifications but it's probably 300W. Without upgrading your power supply you could add a geForce 8500 based card. here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 . if you're willing to add a 400W (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190.

BTW ati recommended minimum is 350W even though Dell offers it on the E521. Dell underrates their PSU's a bit though.
