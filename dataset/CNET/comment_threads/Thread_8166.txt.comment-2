Well, you wonder why the govt.
model is lower in stock.
The only difference is that the model# have yet different part#'s to ID them.
I can only assume, that because the govt.
is a volume purchaser that is has favored status.
I would also suppose you have to prove you're a govt' buyer beforehand.
I may also assume, that a watermark maybe produced during print as a std.
feature not described.
