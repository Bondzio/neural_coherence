I own DVD's from more than one region and I'd like to build a home theatre PC. I am looking to put it into this case: http://www.pcalchemy.com/product_info.php/pName/silverstone-lascala-sstlc19-silver-sstlc19s/cName/htpc-cases thanks, George

But there is hope and that is to use Cnet's article on how to remove the region restriction. Here's the article -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6603_7-5141963-1.html The end result will be region free. Cheers, Bob

I am in Europe and I'd like to have the ability to watch American DVD's I bought when I was over there, but I'd also like to be able to watch any DVD I might buy here in Europe, so that's basically where I'm heading with this. thanks, George

I pulled up the link and didn't see anything about how to make DVD burners region free. Anyway, I am looking to purchase the DVD burner on the internet, so I was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free DVD's that would fit in that case I posted earlier, or at least a DVD burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered.

A region free DVD. &quot;Anyway, I am looking to purchase the DVD burner on the internet, so I was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free DVD's that would fit in that case I posted earlier, or at least a DVD burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered.&quot; Then you'll have to look to the internet from your country. Here such things are not allowed for import so we don't see them often. The website that writes about firmware upgrades is frankly something that is a good source of drive sales for my friends. Given the CNet article and what happens when we use that, why would I need a region free drive? Bob

I brought a boatload of DVDs back from a two-year trip to China home with me. I found a Panasonic player online that handles the DVDs better than my Chinese player did. I hope that this helps.

What I wanted to find was a slimline form factor region free DVD drive to stick it a home theater PC case (I posted a link to it earlier in the thread). I guess my other choice would be to buy a case that houses two DVD drives and have one for the States and one for Europe.
