i have to agree with this.
ive taken my old hard drive out of my old computer, and put it into a freshly built computer, and it ran just fine.
sure some programs had problems but that was complelty cause of things i installed.
other than that the drivers installed for the new hardware, except for a few i had to add through a cd.
