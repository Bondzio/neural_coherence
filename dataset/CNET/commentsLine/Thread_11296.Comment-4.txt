it was out of ink.
and i found out something useful.
when connected to the nas the ink monitor does not work.
installed it on the laptop, and after a few times of going through the tests and checks, i looked at the levels.
duh!!
these levels do not show up correctly when connected to the nas.
put a new cartridge in and voila!
the nas is nice but it will not display the printer monitor.
