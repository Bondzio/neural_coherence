<s> My motherboard won't recognize the AMD XP2900 processor. </s>
<s> I have tried to reset the bios to the recommended 200 mhz x 10x multiplier. </s>
<s> When the system tries to reboot it just hangs. </s>
<s> I have to shut down and clear the cmos just to get it to the bios screen to start again. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> The manual says this processor should work with this motherboard. </s>
