<s> I work for as a Computer Systems Manager for a large government agency with a baffling problem. </s>
<s> Some of what I will say below makes zero sense, which is why I am baffled. </s>
<s> I have a site that received an Ethernet-enabled Toshiba EStudio E452. </s>
<s> We enabled it for Ethernet and plugged it into a nearby wall jack. </s>
<s> It does not work. </s>
<s> The fixed IP does not ping and it picks up a 192 # on a DHCP setup. </s>
<s> We have a nearby working network printer, a Lexmark T632. </s>
<s> We take it's network cable and plug it into the Toshiba's drop. </s>
<s> All works well. </s>
<s> We then take the Lexmark's cable and plug the copier into the Lexmark's drop, we get both fixed IP and a valid DHCP network IP. </s>
<s> We switch wires and every things the same way. </s>
<s> It is NOT the wire. </s>
<s> We run a new drop for the Toshiba and replace its NIC. </s>
<s> No dice. </s>
<s> We go into the Ethernet settings and try all the settings, resetting the card each time, no dice. </s>
<s> We change ports for the Toshiba on the switch, no dice. </s>
<s> One thing I notice. </s>
<s> When an Ethernet drop works, the light on the left side stays green and the light on the right goes green intermittently and randomly. </s>
<s> When the Toshiba is attached to its drop and not seeing the network, that right side light flashes green on a regular basis. </s>
<s> What am I missing here? </s>
<s> Usual RJ45 indicators: Left Green Linked Blinking Network activity Right Unlit 10 Green 100 Yellow 1000 Run a cable directly from printer to switch port and see what happens. </s>
<s> To see if the Ethernet wire or the port on the switch is the problem, connect a laptop to it and see if you can see the network. </s>
<s> If you have internet connection to it, see if you can access the internet. </s>
<s> You haven't mentioned much about the actual problem you're having. </s>
<s> All you say is you've plugged it in and &quot;It does not work.&quot; What is the specific problem when you try to join the Toshiba to your network's domain? </s>
<s> Have you even tried to tried joining it to the domain? </s>
<s> The government domains I've worked with require a fixed IP, meaning you'll need to turn off DHCP and maunally configure IP/DNS settings on the Toshiba. </s>
<s> I cannot ping the copier after I attach an Ethernet cable to it a d give it a known valid IP on the network. </s>
<s> If I cannot ping it, then I cannot set it up as a network printer which is why I am writing this. </s>
<s> BTW, I plug in a laptop and it picks up an IP with no problem via the same cable used by the non-connecting copier. </s>
<s> When the laptop was connected to the tosh-drop, were you able to ping the laptop and can you ping another device from it? </s>
<s> You said the that it picked up an ip address from a dhcp, that's dynamic. </s>
<s> If you have the dhcp set up to give it a number, make sure the tosh-printer is set do take an ip dynamically (or automatically). </s>
<s> Don't try to give it a static address. </s>
<s> If you're required to give it a static address, then make sure you have the right subnet and gateway. </s>
<s> When I plugged in a laptop, I got a correct IP and was able to ping to it and from it to a connected PC and printer. </s>
<s> BTW, when I first plugged in the copier to its drop, and let it try to pick up DHCP, it picked up a 169.254 address. </s>
<s> All gateways and subnets have been checked thoroughly. </s>
<s> Like I said, it is a bizarre problem. </s>
<s> Since the Lexmark and the Toshiba are right next to each other and the drops are not too far from each other, why don't you just switch the connection. </s>
<s> Lexmark &gt;Tosh-drop and Copier &gt;Lexmark-drop. </s>
<s> I think you mentioned that if you switch the cables, they work fine, right? </s>
<s> You may not even have to move the devices if the patch cables are long enough. </s>
<s> This will solve it until you figure out the culprit. </s>
<s> Yes, criss-crossing the wires will work, it just is an ugly solution. </s>
<s> And while it does work, I just want to know why it does not work the other way. </s>
