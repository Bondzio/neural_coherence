How can I get my old but trusty 4050n HP printer to work with my new computer that has no parallel port?
I have some other ports on the back of the printer.
Two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor.
Another looks like a PS2 port I think it is called that was used and I guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse.
thanks in advance for any help, Dave
