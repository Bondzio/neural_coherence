i wanted to put in my two cents if i may.
you mentioned that when the device is not syncing, it's listed as a modem in device manager.
by any chance do you have the vzaccess manager from verizon on the desktop computer (non-working)?
also, have you tried looking at the usb auto sync found within the phone settings?
1. with the flip open, press &quot;ok&quot; 2. scroll to &quot;settings & tools&quot; 3. press 8 usb auto sync then try fooling around with the options: &quot;sync music/ sync data/ ask on plug&quot;?
you may want to try &quot;ask on plug&quot; so that way at least you are being prompted when you plug in your cellphone.
also, what os is your work machine running?
is it xp as well?
