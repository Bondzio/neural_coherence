<s> Installed a new Seagate Sata hd in my wifes tower for more storage space, BIOS is as current as possible,so is windows xp. </s>
<s> Bios will not recognize hd, as I did not install sata raid drivers last time I installed new ide hard drive. </s>
<s> Is there a driver for the ASUS motherboard of her a600n hp tower, I can install, without reinstalling windows. </s>
<s> only added hd for storage. </s>
<s> computer has 2 ide hd's now, but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd. </s>
<s> Hd is a Seagate SATA also. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Step 2. </s>
<s> So far, with NO EXCEPTIONS the BIOS must show the drive. </s>
<s> Any attempt to install drivers will only tax your time and patience. </s>
<s> Your product = http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&product=424351 I see that you might enable a THIRD MASTER in the BIOS at http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1144192 However unless you find a document with the BIOS screen shots, this is as far as I go. </s>
<s> Plan B. </s>
<s> Install some card like this -&gt; http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815124020 but beware that many don't want to flash the BIOS for the IDE emulation so it will work. </s>

<s> Can I just switch the drive to an external with a case and copy her hard drive items she wants saved and then reinstall windows with the sata raid drivers </s>
<s> Sorry if I was unclear. </s>
<s> If the BIOS does not show the drives, no driver known has helped. </s>
<s> Which makes me ask about the document on the machine's BIOS. </s>
<s> If you can't find it, why not take pictures for others to assist? </s>
<s> Why not enable the THIRD MASTER? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> install the oem dvd as per instruction, follow the drive transfer section, should be less than 20 mins job </s>
<s> Proffitt, several monthes later I finally got a chance to look at my wifes pc and installed windows 7 from a flash hd. </s>
<s> I did what you said and looked over the other web shot you found stole a jumper from a old hd and BINGO ! </s>
<s> the drive showed up.... </s>
<s> Thanks A bunch..... and no i am not gonna kiss ya. </s>
<s> Now I will transfer 7 to the 500 and reformat the rest of the ide drives for max space. </s>
<s> Thanks again , glad /i saved this message. </s>
