<s> I have a &quot;D-LINK&quot; cable router with 4 port. </s>
<s> I have 2 PC's, both XP-home and an Xbox. </s>
<s> I've had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said &quot;Cable not connected&quot;. </s>
<s> Same message on all 3. </s>
<s> I checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router. </s>
<s> I saw a reset button on the router, nothing. </s>
<s> What should I look at now? </s>
<s> A new router? </s>
<s> I'm hoping someone has an idea. </s>
