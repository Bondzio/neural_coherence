the clue for me is &quot;i can only load up windows if the driver isn't installed..and when its not installed, the first 3d image that comes up makes my monitor go in standby mode and wont come back..and then i have to restart..&quot; the new card can produce a video signal outside the capability of the monitor.
in fact, it may start off at 800x600 and beyond 72hz.
to fix this... install the driver and on the last reboot, boot to safe mode.
go to the display properties and set the video size to 640x480 and that should work on the next boot.
then you can play with size and refresh rate to see what you can get on your monitor.
