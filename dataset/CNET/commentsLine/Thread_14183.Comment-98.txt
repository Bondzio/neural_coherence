i know it dates me, but anyone out there remember the monrobot?
it was a special purpose computer that was built by monroe calculator for gulf oil corp. the one i worked on was at the port of ft. lauderdale, had a baudot code based processor and was used to accumulate and transmit inventory and delivery data from the oil distribution centers to gulf oil's central office in jacksonville, fl.
it had a 100 track, 10 inch drum memory that was driven by a leather belt that required continuous cleaning to keep the belt from squeeking.
i helped maintain one when i was a student at university of miami, coral gables, fl back in the early 60's.
