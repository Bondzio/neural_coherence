the first personal computer that i used was an hp (can't remember the name), which was a portable witha small screen--similar to one from compact.
it predated the ipm pc, but was probably concurrent with the first apple ii's.
i learned visicalc using it, but quickly found that the desk type hp's did not use the same os, so i could not transfer the info from one to the other.
i think this was in the fall of 1981 or 1982. the computers were owned by the company.
taking the need to transfer data by the &quot;sneakerdisk&quot; method to heart, my first purchase of a personal computer was an ibm pc.
this was to match the pc's that were purchased at my new employer for both design work and letters so that i could use the &quot;sneakernet&quot; approach.
software was pfs write and file along with lotus 1-2-3. a lot of simple engineering design calculations could be made in spreadsheet format and templates, along with finance calculations.
i recall an income tax estimator &quot;program&quot; (template).
we also tracked my wife's business inventory using 1-2-3 for several years.
shortly after purchasing the ibm pc i won a drawing for a ti professional.
the machine came with lotus 1-2-3. this became a hobby machine and i found several improvements at the various pc swap meets.
i bought a hard disk upgrade and a sound card for peanuts.
also, several software programs (used) over the years.
also, there was a 286 card upgrade with 1meg memory that converted the ti pro to a 286 which could run pc software.
ti had an outstanding impact printer with great fonts that we purchased before our first laser printer.
in the pre- laser printer days, we also used an electric typewriter with a serial connection for quality letters.
the shareware word processing program, pc write, had been converted to run on the ti pro so that was used for both the ibm and the ti.
it was a snap to have various printer code templates stored, so that the document could easily go from one printer to another.
