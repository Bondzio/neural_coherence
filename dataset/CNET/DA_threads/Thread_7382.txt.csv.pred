1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	I 've been searching for the & quot ; best & quot ; cordless phone to replace the phones in my place and concluded that the new DECT 6.0 phones would be the best .	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately , when i searched around , the only ones that i could find were : Uniden ( NO headset jack !	St
1.1.4	) , GE ( poor performance/design ) , and some unknown brand ACT or something like that ( poorly made ) .	St
1.1.5	may i please ask if anyone knows when and what models might be available in the USA ?	Ques
1.1.6	i 've tried to look and search but ca n't seem to find any new information on upcoming availability !	St
1.1.7	i 'm sure every cordless phone maker would have several DECT models out soon but there does n't seem to be any announcements or information on that !	St
1.1.8	how unusual .	St
1.1.9	i need a replacement cordless phone pretty soon !	St
1.1.10	thank you very much in advance !	Polite
1.1.11	best ,	St
1.2.1	Look up Philips .	St
1.3.1	but the Philips DECT cordless phone also does n't have a headphone jack either - it looks like the Philips one is simply a rebranded and cosmetically different one from the Uniden .	St
1.3.2	what 's going on with all these DECT phones ?	Ques
1.3.3	there does n't seem to be many coming out ! ?	Ques
1.3.4	!	St
1.4.1	I have just found your answer and it has a plug for an ear piece .	St
1.4.2	The model numbers are Uniden DECT 1060 , 1060-2 , 1080 , 1080-2 .	St
1.5.1	may i please ask where you found the headset jack in the 2 Uniden models you mentioned ?	Ques
1.5.2	i 'm quite sure those 2 models do not have headset jacks .	St
1.5.3	i just double checked yet again .	St
1.5.4	please do tell .	Sug
1.5.5	thx in advance !	St
