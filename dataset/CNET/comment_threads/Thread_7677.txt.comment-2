The Chernobyl virus noted at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_%28computer_virus%29 could wipe out the BIOS of a PC but it was so rare that I doubt many could have lost a PC to that.
All others can put the PC back into operation by reloading the OS but I am encountering folk that didn't know that.
As to the tablet, such is not commonly installed as it's not a PC.
