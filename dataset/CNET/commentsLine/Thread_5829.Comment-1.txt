currently use a dell 8250 with 512 ram (4x128).
i do a lot of large coreldraw file printing (example: 100 copies of a 10 meg file).
i also multitask with at least 2 browsers being open, 1 or 2 additional files that i am working on in draw.
question is this.... if i increase my ram to 768m (+$250) or 1g (+600), will i gain that much speed with redrawing corel files, internet work, etc (while multitasking)?
also, does the ram have anything to do with the spooling speed to my hp 1700 printer?
i don't want to spend the $ if i will only see a 10% increase in performance.
thanks, flip
