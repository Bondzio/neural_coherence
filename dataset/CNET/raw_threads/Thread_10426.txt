If you want to get it back you can purchase a video card with 32MB on-board RAM (not shared) for less than $30.00. You really aren't going to be getting much processing power back from this, though. RAM is pretty cheap, it would probably be more cost efficient and gain you a lot more performance to just buy another 256 chip and be done with it. Good luck! Teri
