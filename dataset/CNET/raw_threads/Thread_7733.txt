Need help, Just installed a geforce 4200 agp on a MSI 64 bit Motherboard running a AMD 3000+ with 512 megs of ram on Win XP Pro..I have loaded the latest video drivers and the correct motherboard drivers also.When i try to play SOF the background is blocky and no images show up at all.I have tryed another card and get the same results,I also have tryed several other driver versions and still get the same thing.Could this be a motherboard issue??
