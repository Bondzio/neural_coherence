<s> I'm having the darndest time cooling my CPU. </s>
<s> It seems to idle at abot 55 C. I had the stock fan in there, but replaced it with a copper hsf with silver 5. </s>
<s> It started off cooler when I started it up again, but then went back up to 55. </s>
<s> It's a AMD Athlon 3000+ on an Epox 8KDA series MoBo, 1GB RAM. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what's wrong? </s>
<s> I'd start by checking to see what AMD recommends in terms of optimum temperature parameters and cooling. </s>
<s> (I'm assuming that your CPU isn't seriously overclocked and that your PC isn't filled with dust.) </s>
<s> I wouldn't call 55 degrees overheating. </s>
<s> My overclocked Celeron cpu have been running at about 70C for more than 2 years now. </s>
<s> high for an XP, if it is the new 90 NM 64 bit CPU [socket 939] it IS somewhat high. </s>
<s> The socket 754 3000+ dissipates a max of 89 Watts, the 90 NM 64 watts. </s>
<s> The likely problem is that the interior ambient air of the case is too hot. </s>
<s> You probably need at least one more case fan, but you also have to have the fans working together, not fighting each other. </s>
<s> Try to keep that air about 1/2 inch above the hub of the CPU fan below 95 F [35C]. </s>
<s> AMD tests the HSF that comes with the retail box CPU at 40C ambient to provide adequate cooling. </s>
<s> But at that internal ambient temp the CPU will be running about what you are getting. </s>
<s> Now, I only use cases that have a top fan exhausting air, and a side fan blowing in, a rear exhaust fan and a power supply with two fans. </s>
<s> I keep the interior below 90F. </s>
<s> Sometimes I also add a front intake fan. </s>
<s> Both AMD and Intel have multiple CPU's that use the same numbers, even though they may differ substantially. </s>
<s> Thus you really need to specify the specific CPU version. </s>
<s> You can downoad all types of thermal data and voltage information on each CPU model/version from the AMD site. </s>
<s> Hi, Cool your CPU then it will perform. </s>
<s> AMD CPU gets hot. </s>
<s> You should apply the heatsink compound to the heatsink. </s>
<s> Also check the fan. </s>
<s> You can check the following page for CPU installation. </s>

<s> A GOOD CPU operating temp is 50 deg. </s>
<s> C, give or take 5 deg. </s>
<s> But I would look into Ray's suggestion to increase the airflow in the case itself to allow more air around the CPU. </s>
<s> Round cables, another fan, funneling the flow that direction, etc. </s>
<s> Dating back to Athlon, AMD recommends 42 deg. </s>
<s> C case temp and about 50-55 deg. </s>
<s> CPU as the Optimum (ideal), and anything close as fine. </s>
