i know it's factory oc'd to 730mhz, but it's still not worth $230 considering most 8600gts's will easily oc to 710mhz.
here's one for $165 with a $15 rebate.
the 8600gts won't play most dx10 titles at acceptable framerates.
so why not stick with a dx9 card that will run outperform it... like the geforce 7900gs or radeon x1950pro.
$165 will get better performance in the games you mentioned.
