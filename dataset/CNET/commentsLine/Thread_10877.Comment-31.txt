i have used two different solid state drive models in laptops in recent years.
the models i have used have been intel x25-m 160 gb (in dell laptops) and the intel 330 series 120 gb drives (in hp and lenovo).
i find intel ssd drives to be very reliable, and the excellent &quot;intel solid state drive toolbox&quot; accurately shows both &quot;drive health&quot; & estimated life remaining&quot;.
intel retail kits come with all the accessories to attach the drive inside a desktop pc as well.
my intel x25-m currently in use in my dell vostro laptop is getting on for 3 years old now the drive health shows 100% and life remaining shows around 90%.
i have run various disk checking applications, and indeed there is nothing wrong with this drive after 3 years of continual use (allot of video transcoding among other things).
the thing to worry about with solid state drives is they are slightly thicker then the standard 2.5 inch drive, so on some laptops where the disk bay is the slot in type they won't fit.
dell (home) laptops with slot in bay are typically too narrow.
hp and lenovo laptops with the slot in bay are typically ok. also make sure that you bios is newer than 2008 as some old phoenix bios's cannot see this drive and that can be a huge problem.
see my amazon review of the 330 series and comments for info on that.
hope this helps.
