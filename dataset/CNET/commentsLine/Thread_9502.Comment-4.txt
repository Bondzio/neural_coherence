most cpu/hsf setups are rated for thier highest level of usage.
so, if you get a fan for xyz-1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to xyz-1300cpu then you're really going beyond the rating of the fan.
though a fan can take excessive heat, don't expect all fans to do so and whatever &quot;quality&quot; means alot.
thus, some namebrnads fans are capable of handling oc'ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to oc to as a safe bet of sustained usage.
remember you still have to &quot;exhaust&quot; the immediate heat build-up as well to best serve any hsf to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail.
