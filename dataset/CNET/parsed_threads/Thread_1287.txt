<s> I just put together my first computer and I am running a SATA HD on the new computer. </s>
<s> And, I would like to transfer the old IDE hard drive onto the new system. </s>
<s> However, both HD have windows XP pro running on them so I am afraid that once I add the old HD onto the new system, a crash/conflict will occur. </s>
<s> I'm not sure where to go from here. </s>
<s> After you install the old drive, start compter, go into BIOS settings, make sure the primary/first boot volume is the SATA drive. </s>
<s> If Windows XP starts OK, transfer important files from the old drive to the new, and reformat the old drive to have it as free storage space. </s>
