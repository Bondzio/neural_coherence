<s> Hi, I can't seem to access the Net when transferring large files between my desktop (WinXP SP3, 100Mbps net card) and my laptop (Win7, 54Mbps WiFi). </s>
<s> I have an EDIMAX BR-6228nC 150 Mbps broadband router to which my desktop is wired and the laptop connects through WiFi. </s>
<s> The speeds never go above 2.5MBps, so there should be plenty of bandwidth left for Internet use. </s>
<s> My router config confirms that there's no Internet connection while transferring the files. </s>
<s> Can anyone please help me with this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I had a similar problem when transferring large files, but I would lose all connectivity and the router would reset itself. </s>
<s> I tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make/model router. </s>
<s> I haven't had a problem since then. </s>
<s> Does the router have the latest firmware installed? </s>
<s> Have you tried a factory reset? </s>
<s> Do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router? </s>
<s> Since I don't have the full picture of router and more settings I suggest you try router and such defaults FIRST along with a channel check. </s>
<s> What's that? </s>
<s> Read this recent discussion. </s>
