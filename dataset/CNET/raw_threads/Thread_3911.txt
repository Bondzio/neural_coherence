I have a &quot;wired network&quot; because of physical disabilities and was wondering what equipment I needed for the following setup. All I want to do is run (2) PC's on the same desk connected to the Internet at the same time. I have a Scientifiic Atlanta wired (RJ45) cable modem. Would the following be all I need to purchase? Linksys - EtherFast 5-Port 10/100 Workgroup Switch Speed - 10/100 Mbps Auto Detecting - Yes Auto Sensing - Yes Number of LAN Ports - 5 LAN Connection - RJ-45 Ethernet LEDs - Collision , Power , Speed Uplink - PortYes Or do I need to purchase a wired router like the one below? Dynex - 4-Port Ethernet Broadband Router Speed - 10/100 Mbps Auto Sensing - Yes Number of LAN Ports - 4 System RequirementsWindows and Mac operating systems, Linux; Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator versions 6 or above; installed Ethernet adapter LAN - ConnectionEthernet &quot;The above brands/products are just for question purposes. I am not really familiar with either company and they're equipment or status in the industry&quot;. I would greatly appreciate any positive feed back on this matter. Every penny counts these days with medical bills overwhelming me. I am hoping I can go with the 'Linksys' just because I have heard and read that they have semi-reliable equipment. SONY PCV-RX650 WinXP Home SP_2 IE6/Firefox 3.06 ATI Radeon GPU 256Mb Ram 1 GB Ram installed 80GB HD's Above details are for both systems. Thank you, not-a-clue

Linksys is one of the top brands along with D-link. Belkin is another and they have a basic wired router for about forty bucks. It is also wireless in case you need that for future.
