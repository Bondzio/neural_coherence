but the short version is that folk &quot;snapped up&quot; the 99 buck hp on the firesale.
it does the basics of web browsing and reading (pdf?)
well enough.
it proves that folk will dive in at the 99 and 199 price.
--&gt; my prediction?
if you wait for it, the new kindle might be in that price range since it will be subsidized by kindle/amazon book and app sales.
yes, that's not here and now but worth noting.
i have the nook color and find it very useful.
i would look at that again.
