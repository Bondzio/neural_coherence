Hi, I picked up this monitor from a local goodwill for about $20.
It didn't have a power supply, so I ordered a replacement (not from HP, from another vendor).
The one I got is rated at 12V, 5A, and it worked fine.
But after a day, I discovered the backlight power failure issue that apparently plagues these monitors.
Discovered the thread here, and though most of the solutions pointed to problems in HP's power supply, I wanted to see if anyone has a suggestion if I'm using a new, non-HP power supply.
thanks!
