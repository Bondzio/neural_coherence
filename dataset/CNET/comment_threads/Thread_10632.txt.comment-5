Then you are stuck with issues that require you to figure which part is either getting too hot, if there is a part that doesn't work well with the others and ARCANE things like matching the BIOS settings to your RAM.
Today I'm beginning to find that such is too much to ask and the sellers of this are not providing support even when you buy from them.
