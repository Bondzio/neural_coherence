<s> Okay i put the duo stick into the adapter and put it in my laptop which has vista it says format disc so i do and it says that it's unable to format. </s>
<s> So i go to XP computer and put it in it works perfectly so i dont know why it works on XP but not VISTA. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I'm trying to format it for my PSP. </s>
<s> So you know i tried formatting it in PSP didn't work i think it's my computer though. </s>
<s> If this is an older stick this might be the problem. </s>
<s> List the brand and model number here and I'll look it up for you or go to the manufactures web site and see if you can find it's system requirements. </s>
<s> I believe this maybe for a camera. </s>
<s> Is the camera compatible with Vista is it's driver up to date? </s>
<s> What is the make and model of the camera? </s>
<s> Sorry it took so long for someone to get with you about this problem. </s>
