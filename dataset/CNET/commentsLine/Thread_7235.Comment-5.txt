waiting &quot;until the roll out&quot; seems to be a never ending story.
i'm a multiply disabled guy who is homebound.
fortunately for me, my town has blanket-wifi ... i don' need no frakking 3/4g.
:-p. i don't want an ipad that costs more and has no usb, sd slot or adobe flash, a kindle dx costs so much yet does so little & just 1 to 2 hundred more, sometimes less, gets me allot mores features.
i do my due-diligence and google my froogle in research, but for a 10&quot; android 3.0 the date of release gets further and further away, &quot;december 2010, ok maybe january 2011, just kidding, it's february.
we lied it's march ... april fool's!&quot; i'm getting tired of it.
sure there is the mortola xoom, but the price is really high.
i'm looking at the notion ink, asus ep101tc, maybe the cheaper wifi only xoom that's supposedly coming, but i'm growing impatient
