<s> Hi, I am for sure getting the E8500 core 2 duo CPU, and later planning on getting a Radeon 4890. </s>
<s> The CPU is very nice but I'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree. </s>
<s> I'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt PSU at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 RAM. </s>
<s> Any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance. </s>
<s> unless you're doing video editting or some 3d ray-tracing, the e8500 has plenty of compute power. </s>
<s> I agree with the previous poster. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that E8500 (3.16 GHz) can outperform many quad-cores in single and dual-threaded applications because of the higher processor frequency. </s>
<s> Good purchase! </s>
