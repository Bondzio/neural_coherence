If I have four slots in a row, and two already contain cards, can I plug my ethernet card into either free slot?
What are the two cards already there, sound and video?
Will Windows configure even if we're at home and not on the college LAN yet?
New at this, but I have added RAM before.
Compaq Presario 2.8G about 3 months old.
