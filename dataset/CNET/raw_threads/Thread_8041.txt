I plugged in the flash drive in my winXP SP2 desktop, there was no any response, no icon in system, nor did it light up. I tried it in another desktop (win2K), it failed to light up or appear in the system.,either. Even worse, my friend used his flash drive (the same model) in my computer with winXP SP2, it became corrupted too. It didn't light up when plugged in, nor did the icon appear in the system. He tried several other desktops or laptos with winXP, and nothing worked.What happened to the flash drives? Did they get burned up in my desktop? But there was no any indication of it. Once a time I used the flash drive, winXP warned ''low power'' for the device or something like that, but I tried other USB ports, it worked fine then. But this time, suddenly it didn't work. If someone would give any clue, I'd very appreciate it. There are important data on the two flash drives.

There is a message about current draw on USB which your machine maker has a patch for. But I don't know if this applies since you didn't supply the exact error message. At least that message is fixable. I can't tell if it applies. Bob
