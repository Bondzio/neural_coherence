1.1.1	I have an HP Compaq dv7100 Small Form Factor Desktop that I want to upgrade the Processor in.	St
1.1.2	It is an HP 097Ch Motherboard with and Intel i915G Chipset and an LGA 775 Processor Socket.	St
1.1.3	It currently has a Prescott Pentium 4 HT 530 3.0Ghz Processor and I am wondering if there is a processor upgrade for this older Desktop that would be worth it.	St
1.1.4	I know the LGA 775 was used all the way up to the Core 2 Extreme quad-cores, but I would imagine this machine would only be capable of maybe a Pentium D. On the HP website it only shows Pentium 4 and Celeron processors but I do believe that is just what they were sold with	St
1.2.1	http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&objectID=c00590499	St
1.3.1	If this is being done as a challenge to see if it can be done it might be interesting but as to whether it is a technically or economically sound upgrade, that I would question.	St
1.3.2	There are more things to consider than just the processor in such a modification.	St
1.4.1	3.0GHz was about the top of the line CPU for that CPU line.	St
1.4.2	You would do much better to research what else can be changed.	St
1.4.3	For most folk they are looking to get the video up to speed.	St
1.4.4	Research if you can pop in one of the 30 to 50 buck ATI 5450 1GB video cards in this machine.	St
1.4.5	It is one of the best last upgrades that won't have you change the power supply.	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	This is currently just an old PC that isn't really doing anything but is soon to be turned into mainly just a music computer.	St
1.5.2	I have already Upgraded RAM to 3.0GB DDR PC3200 (Maximum as I'm currently only running 32-Bit OS), and I just ordered a New Video-Card for the PC.	St
1.5.3	For me it is mainly the challenge, I enjoy doing this and even if it doesn't show in much in actual performance it's more for the heck of it anyways.	St
1.5.4	I really haven't had a problem with the P4 HT 3.0 in this system, it's actually a relatively fast Processor, and unitl recently I did not know it was a 64-Bit Capable processor.	St
1.5.5	Just wondering if there is anything faster that can physically be put into the system.	St
1.6.1	I have actually already bought a Video card for the system and upgraded the Ram.	St
1.6.2	I was just wondering if there was any other processor that was better that could be compatible with the board.	St
1.6.3	I'm more of an AMD guy, so I understand board capabilities and the Processor Sockets better with the AMD's.	St
1.6.4	The fact the LGA 775 was used for a wide selection of Processors makes it difficult to know which ones are compatible or not.	St
1.6.5	I know that TDP is one of the main factors, but I see that a lot of the Core 2 Duo's have a TDP of 65W which is far lower than the current Pentium 4 at 84W.	St
1.6.6	Are the Pentium 4 HT's and the Celeron's the only compatible Processors with this board?	St
1.6.7	For me it's not a big deal.	St
1.6.8	This processor is probably more than I'll ever need, but I've been migrating most of my systems to Windows 7 and I was just wondering if there was a plausible upgrade for this system.	St
1.6.9	I have a few AM2 boards that had low end Semprons that I just upgraded to Athlon Dual-Cores and I was just wondering if there was something similar for this line of LGA 775 Socket.	St
1.6.10	Thanks for all the info!	St
1.7.1	Only thing is, this isn't quite my motherboard.	St
1.7.2	I found the correct one on the HP website later.	St
1.7.3	Reason being is that this one supports DDR2 Ram, mine only supports DDR.	St
1.7.4	Thanks anyways.	St
1.8.1	Here's the hurdle for OEM based systems when considering cpu swaps.	St
1.8.2	The main issue besides finding a cpu that actually uses the LGA775 is the family and class it has to reside with.	St
1.8.3	Basically, that's a drop-in and forget.	St
1.8.4	the other side is the bios support for that cpu and the chipset which in turn can use or allow full access to the cpu abilities.	St
1.8.5	That in turn is not a given, which again is best found under the family and class of cpu.	St
1.8.6	I find reviewing the mtrbd.	St
1.8.7	specs and the chipset will provide much of the basic info.	St
1.8.8	Since this is an Intel cpu you find it at the support website and check against the tables provided.	St
1.8.9	Locate yours and notice the specs, now find similar matching specs, which in turn you're looking for a faster one, typically.	St
1.8.10	Next, locate that the FSB etc.	St
1.8.11	are supported by that mtrbd.	St
1.8.12	now you match all this and then find a cpu.	St
1.8.13	That;'s where the bios comes in, its best to have the latest already installed prior to any cpu swap.	St
1.8.14	Swap cpu and hope it acknowledges it and allows its use.	St
1.8.15	Most OEM don't allow you to tweek or tune if at all, it's a accept or reject sort of thing or less than desired install.	St
1.8.16	You can drop-in a LGA775 cpu but it may not always be a good one, again because of the bios setting needs.	St
1.8.17	So check and double check before you do this.	Sug
1.8.18	Overall, you won't damage the cpu if LGA775 allowable.	St
1.8.19	Alas, use the &quot;stock number&quot; on the cpu itself for best info and Intel tables once cleaned of paste.	St
1.8.20	tada -----Willy	St
1.9.1	Taken from the HP/Compaq support website: http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11948_div/11948_div.HTML Now clean your cpu of paste locate stock number and then find from that Compaq what can be done or found by comparing specs.	St
1.9.2	tada -----Willy	St
