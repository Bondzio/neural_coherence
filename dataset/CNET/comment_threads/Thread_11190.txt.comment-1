i have an atix1900xtx which worked fine but since i have done a bios update everytime i play a game the card seems to reset its self (graphics card fan starts spinning fast).
Could they be a new setting under bios which maybe doing it i dont think its overheating.
When i play a game afte about 10 mins my screen goes white and the card reboots and windows says the graphics card stops responing.
Im running vista and my mobo is an ecs p965t-a Cheers chris
