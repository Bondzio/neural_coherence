Hello, My machine is an HP pavilion xl946, AMD Athlon 1.1GHz, 512MB RAM, DVD-rom, DVDR and 2x USB 2.0 PCI cards.
It has USB 1.1 fused to the motherboard ...I have no idea about the &quot;motherboard driver&quot; nor do I know where to locate it.
I will happily retrieve per your instructions.
Thank you!
