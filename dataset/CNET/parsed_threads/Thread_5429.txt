<s> This is my first post and I would like to apologize for any overlap with content on other threads! </s>
<s> Please excuse the length, the amount of questions I ask, any ineloquent terminology and the frequent use of the phase 'central hub'..... </s>
<s> Broadly speaking - 1. </s>
<s> What I am looking for is a central hub that backs up data from multiple macs, works as an external hard drive for these same macs and acts as a media server streaming music and HD videos wirelessly to compatible devices around the house. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I would like the hub to protect its own data 3. </s>
<s> I do not mind if the central hub is made of one or many devices chained together, but I am looking for performance and reliability over value for money. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> I need an initial 4tb of writable space, and want it to be reasonable future proof / extendable 5. </s>
<s> I do not want speed issues and want the hub to do be able to do more than one task at once fairly efficiently. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> My budget is up to &#163;1000 or $1400 A. I guess the first question is what should the central hub look like? </s>
<s> Is NAS the way to go? </s>
<s> Some say that NAS at the consumer level is not quite there yet in terms of ease of use. </s>
<s> I would not consider myself to be anything other than a novice when it comes to technical prowess. </s>
<s> For reference, my greatest technical of the last few years has been downgrading my 2011 MBP to Snow Leopard - i.e. </s>
<s> I can follow lengthy tasks in a step-by-step manner, but have not broader understanding of such things as servers etc. </s>
<s> Some things I would like B. I have a Macbook Air running Lion and a MBP on Snow Leopard. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to have them both access and write files to the central hub / NAS and use it as their Time Machines. </s>
<s> Does having two differing OS matter? </s>
<s> (Especially re Q below) C. I would like the hub to stream iTunes music and videos to both MBs. </s>
<s> I use VLC for video content and would like to keep doing so. </s>
<s> I'd also like to stream iTunes music to my iPhone. </s>
<s> For both is it possible to stream when outside of the home using a NAS? </s>
<s> D. What is the best way to go about protecting data on the hub / NAS? </s>
<s> As mentioned above there is a requirement for it to act as an external drive and media server, meaning the content will not be anywhere else. </s>
<s> Should I be looking to connect and external hard drive to the hub / NAS and / or configure with Raid? </s>
<s> E. If raid is necessary, is Raid 1 the best way to go for a NAS setup if you have drive bay space and cost is not an issue? </s>
<s> I've seen many people write that raid-enabled NAS is not a backup drive itself and that both drives fail... F. Finally, in an ideal world I want to get away from iTunes and rip my entire music collection again at FLAC quality. </s>
<s> As a result I would like to be able to get something like Media Monkey working with the central hub, using parallels to host it on the MacBooks. </s>
<s> Is possible to have 2 OSs on the same device accessing the central hub / NAS in different ways? </s>
<s> G. At the moment, if NAS is where I should be then I'm thinking of something like the DS411+II from Synology but I like some of the consumer-aimed features (iTunes server etc) of the more basic QNAP TS-410 as well.... With the Synology I would like to fit it with 4 2tb hard drives with raid 1... As a NAS newbie I am worried that the 411 might be too complicated but I guess I'm more worried that the consumer/entry level boxes are less extendible, more limited and much slower... thoughts? </s>
<s> Anyway that's quite enough now Any help on any of it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you again! </s>
<s> Anytime I find a centralized backup I find a central place for disaster. </s>
<s> Folk forget to backup their central backup! </s>
