kees hit the nail on the head.
all hard drives will eventually fail be cause they are mechanical and will wear out.
1. if you use external drives for backup of your internal drive, you need to have two.
keep one in your house/office, and another identical one in an off site location ( friends house or another office in a different building.
you need to think about a fire, burgulary, lightning, etc) 2. if you use an external drive for routine work ( like of your main internal drive is not big enough), then you need to have two backups of your routine external drive as above in # 1.
3. if your files are not large (1 gb or less) online backup services are also good.
i cannot use them because i do a lot of video editing and my files are so large that it would take weeks to transfer to an online service.
one note that i see in this post is that external drives fail more often than internal drives.
i don't understand this because i have been told that the actual drives are the same and the only difference is that the internal drives are interfaced to the computer with sata connectors while most external drives are really the same drive which is put in an enclosure that uses a usb interface to connect to the computer.
( although i just bought 3 fantom (tm) drives that have esata ports which run about 3 times as fast as usb ) could someone clarify this for me?
