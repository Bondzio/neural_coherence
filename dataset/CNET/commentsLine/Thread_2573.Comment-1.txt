i moved the motherboard of a hp pavilion system from the hp case to a standard atx case to allow for a larger power supply and better vid card.
i had been running it open case with the switch from the old computer becuase i couldnt figure out the plug for the case.
stupid right?
well now, i turned it off last night, and it wont turn on again.
i plug it in everything starts humming and moving even if the power switch isnt connected!
am i going to need a new motherboard, and wth happened to her overnight.
