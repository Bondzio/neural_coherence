<s> [img] http://www.greenzer.com/blog/blog_image_store/2009/03/natual_soap.jpg [/img] is it true that if we use Soap bar to clean the surface of a disc the chemicals from it can eat away the plastic surface of the disc even after washing, even if it's a pressed silver bottomed disc like audio music cds you buy in retail shop? </s>
<s> thanks a lots! </s>
<s> How vigorously you clean. </s>
<s> First off, CDs shouldn't get that dirty but accidents happen. </s>
<s> I'll say clean water with mild dish washing soap (Joy, etc.) </s>
<s> is fine. </s>
<s> Don't touch the disk with any solid bar of soap...only diluted liquid and only if the residue won't come off with water alone. </s>
<s> Something oily will need a surfactant. </s>
<s> You can dry with a clean microfiber cloth by wiping gently. </s>
<s> Or, some will use canned air but this is expensive and some will say this has environmental issues. </s>
<s> Don't use solvents that can attack plastic. </s>
<s> Generally alcohol and mineral spirits don't but I'd not use them. </s>
<s> This really becomes a users choice. </s>
<s> Don't overdo it and don't clean CDs that are working. </s>
<s> Lasers in players can get through some junk and minor scratches but, when they weaken, will become more sensitive. </s>
<s> You'd have to consider replacing the CD/DVD player if you have trouble with several disk in your collection. </s>
<s> Well, if you are living in busy town or city, then for sure, all plastics will be affected from atmospheric pollution, therefore, you should keep all your CDs in their packs. </s>
<s> A safe way to clean CDs is to buy from optician shop a cleaning liquid for &quot;coated lenses&quot; or a cleaning kit! </s>
<s> the sensitive side of a CD is the printed, upper side, and hot the clear plastic side! </s>
<s> Both are sensitive, but the printed side is the one containing the data. </s>
<s> If you've taken a player apart, you'll see that the laser beam is directed at the clear plastic side and penetrates through it into the upper layer which will contain the printing or label. </s>
<s> The laser is not directed downward onto the label but upward through the polycarbonate side. </s>
