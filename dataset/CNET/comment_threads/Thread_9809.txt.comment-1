I want to build a PC but I have no experience with hardware.
I've watched tutorials on how to build a PC and done some research on hardware and this is the build I came up with.
I'd appreciate some feedback before I spend $900.
I want to be able to play games like Skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods.
This may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?).
Could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that?
Motherboard CPU GPU HDD RAM DVD PSU Case OS $861 + shipping.
How does this look?
Am I missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)?
