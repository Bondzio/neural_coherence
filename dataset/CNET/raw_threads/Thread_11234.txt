I read around and there seem to be a lot of things to consider such as different types of hard disks and maybe I am short on power supply and that the Dimension 2400 only has one power source for hard disk. There is a lot more than that as well it seems. Below are some information from Belarc advisor Operating System System Model Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 (build 2600) Dell Computer Corporation Dimension 2400 Enclosure Type: Space-saving Processor 2.40 gigahertz Intel Celeron 8 kilobyte primary memory cache 128 kilobyte secondary memory cache Main Circuit Board Board: Dell Computer Corp. 0G1548 A00 Serial Number: ..CN708213C2G0HP.

A hard disk of around 100 Gb would be great. Thanks a lot in advance.

Google this: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=SUPPORTED+Hard+Drive+SIZES+Dimension+2400 finds this on the first page: http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/dimen_2400 It notes 160GB drives so with Dell's latest BIOS it seems you can support 160GB drives without further research. If you need another power connection, there are Y connectors at the stores. Bob

If it supports that then you can get any drive you want. Just buy one and hook it up as slave and see if your bios id's it as the correct size? If it does your off and running. If not buy this. http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Western-Digital-Internal-Hard-Drive-WD800JBRTL-/sem/rpsm/oid/56383/catOid/-12976/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do You can also go with and ATA pci card with lba-48 support .... the only problem is your power supply .... you may need to upgrade that and dell (unless they've changed) uses proprietary PSU's so it could be tricky?
