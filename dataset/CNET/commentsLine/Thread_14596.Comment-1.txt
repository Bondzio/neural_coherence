hi, i've got 2 two rooms - each with 2 computers and a wired ethernet hub - interconnected by an ethernet cable.
i use dial-up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or dsl nor am i really interested in getting either in the near future.
i just got a wi-fi capable laptop and thought i'd get acquainted with wi-fi access to my wired network.
my first thought was getting a wireless access point, say a linksys wap54g, but now i'm confused.
a router, say a linksys wrt54g, *seems* to have more functionality - 1) a wap 2) a hub - with 4 ethernet ports (???)
3) a cable/dsl router for *less money*, as opposed to a wap with only 1 ethernet port.
am i missing something ???
can i really replace a wired hub with the wrt54g and get wired hub functionality and wireless access to my wired network ?
thanks in advance
