<s> For some reason, when I attach my external hard drive via USB 2.0, Windows(XP w/ SP2) installs the driver(s), tells me the hardware is installed and ready to use, but when I open My Computer to access my files in the hard drive, there is no F: drive present. </s>
<s> All that shows up is my CDRW/DVD drive, C:, and Memory Stick drive. </s>
<s> What can I do to access my information? </s>
<s> It is vital for work, and every second I'm without the information on it is costly. </s>
<s> I took my old hard drive out of my old laptop and put it in a case to use as an external hard drive for my new laptop and I installed the software and it said it was working, then I went into my computer and its not there. </s>
<s> I have the right case for it and software, and the cables are not broken so I don't know whats wrong. </s>
<s> Si. </s>
<s> given that all other things are equal... you may have to &quot;activate&quot; the drive. </s>
<s> Go to My Computer in Windows Explorer and right click. </s>
<s> Click on &quot;Manage&quot;. </s>
<s> Under &quot;Storage&quot; click on &quot;Disk Management&quot;. </s>
<s> Now look for the drive and make sure it's &quot;activated&quot;. </s>
<s> If not activate it. </s>
<s> Hope this works for you. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
