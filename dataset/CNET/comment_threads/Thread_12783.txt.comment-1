I just bought a Epson Stylus C66 that came with the CD to install it but right now my drive isnt working correctly and will recognize CDs but not load them.
Is there a way to install the printer on my computer without that disc?
Every wizard i did says it needs me to put it in and i cant.
Can i download something somewhere?
Thanks
