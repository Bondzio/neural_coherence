took out the video card, and plugged in the integrated video card adapter into my asus m3n78 pro motherboard.
i managed to get past the startup screen.
the problem now is that when i get to the vista loading screen, the bars manage to move two times before the screen freezes, then i see a bsod flash for an instant and the screen goes to black
