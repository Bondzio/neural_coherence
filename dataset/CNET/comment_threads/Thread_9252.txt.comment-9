Thanks for sharing your solution and I certainly agree that some of the USB stuff just isn't ready for prime time.
RE your statement 'remove all peripherals ANDm importantly, remove the power supply.'
Do you mean disconnect (vice physically remove) peripherals as in internal and external drives (data and power) and remove any cards from the MB, etc.?
Physically remove PS or just discomnnect it from MB and or remove the AC power cord ?
Do you get a lot of question about getting into the case on getting everything back together ?
