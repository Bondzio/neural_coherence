<s> hi every one i am curintly useing a older asus AGP not sure of the chip set. </s>
<s> 2.4GHz 2 gig 512mn 7600 nvidia. </s>
<s> i am looking at either to update my sistem and go with a pci board and up my proseserr to a 3.0 doul. </s>
<s> or get a AGP radon 3850 card. </s>
<s> i'm not sure if that card will boost my gameing by atleast 40% better, or would it be better to get a new system with a 9800 nvidia and upgrade to three gigs of ram. </s>
<s> i am willing to pay for either just ot sure on how much of a impact the new card will make. </s>
<s> Besides how many know about the /3G switch and how often software won't use it? </s>
<s> -&gt; The 3850 in AGP is a little hard to find but I'd like to move off any single CORE CPU today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You're at that stage were any money sunk into an older system will the return benefit be decent. </s>
<s> -OR- You can use those funds plus some more and get abroad a newer system. </s>
<s> Since, you mentioned gaming, it maybe better to really upgrade rather than drag older stuff along. </s>
<s> The choice is yours. </s>
<s> The newer system pretty much requires more than new video card, etc. </s>
<s> and that's the extra cost, but you should be better suited for newer games and/or other demands placed on the system. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> but it's slower than a $160 9600gt. </s>
<s> i doubt if your agp board has socket 775, so your best cpu option will probably be a 3ghz socket 478 p4 for about $80. </s>
<s> that cpu will only be comparable to low-end dual core cpu at best. </s>
<s> so, a gpu+cpu upgrade will wind up costing you $290 and you'll still be in the low-end. </s>
<s> instead, get a $80 mobo ( GIGABYTE GA-P35-S3G ), a $150 video card ( palit 9600gt ), and a $120 cpu ( core2duo e4500 , OC it 3ghz by selecting 1066fsb). </s>
<s> add 2gb of ram for $40 and you're at $400... only $110 above your agp upgrade but much much faster and firmly in mid-range. </s>
<s> what is the best mother board,cpu,graphics card, prosseorre and ram chips? </s>
<s> But my shopping list might be a Core 2 Dual (or quad), 2.0GB RAM, etc. </s>
<s> and a card off this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/03/05/the_best_gaming_graphics/ This would get me a best to good gaming rig. </s>
<s> Best could be too expensive? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> just click the text in the parenthesis. </s>
<s> btw, the palit 9600gt has a $40 rebate making it only $110. </s>
<s> that's a fantastic price considering it's in the top 10% for single GPU gaming performance. </s>
<s> Perhaps this will make your choice a little clearer - I am in the exact same situation as you (though waiting for Nehalem to come out) and bought the 3850 AGP. </s>
<s> Big mistake. </s>
<s> Ati/AMD DOES NOT offer driver support for these AGP cards. </s>
<s> It took me about a week to get the card to work (I still have no sound b/c of some driver incompatibility). </s>
<s> If I were you I would save your money (and a giant migrane) and wait until next gen CPUs come out. </s>
<s> If you really must upgrade, do yourself a favor and get a 7XXX nVidia card. </s>
<s> STAY AWAY from 3850 AGP. </s>
<s> This card will work FINE, if you install the drivers CORRECTLY. </s>
<s> -- Meaning, you will have to do a MANUAL install of the drivers (pointing windows to your folder containing the actual .inf files for the card). </s>
<s> You will also have to install ATI Tool app. </s>
<s> to force windows to use the proper settings for the card. </s>
<s> After this is done, your card will work just fine. </s>
<s> The reason for all of these &quot;installation hoops&quot; is because ATi STOPPED MANUFACTURING AGP CARDS after the X1600 Pro. </s>
<s> All &quot;ATi&quot; AGP cards are now manufactured by 3rd Party companies who simply build the AGP card with the chipset borrowed from the original PCI-E card... thus, &quot;converting&quot; a PCI-E card for use in an AGP environment. </s>
<s> You can also try www.omegadrivers.net for compatible drivers for this card. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
<s> If you decide to get a new card, first detemine if the game you want requires a certain type of card. </s>
<s> its weth it </s>
