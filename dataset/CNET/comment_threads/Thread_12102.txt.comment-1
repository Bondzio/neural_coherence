I foolishly installed CloneCD, and then decided to uninstall it, now my DVD drive won't recognise ANY discs at all (message: 'Insert disc in drive' even when i've put a disc in and double-clicked the drive icon).
I'm sure I read here somewhere (can't find the link)that CloneCD deletes crucial files and causes this problem...does anyone know how to remedy it?
My DVD drive is a Samsung SD-616-T, and yes, i've tried Samsungs site but couldn't find a cure.
All help greatfully appreciated!
