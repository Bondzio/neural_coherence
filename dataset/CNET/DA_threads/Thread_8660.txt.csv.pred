1.1.4	Also , the gpu is not set in stone I 'm willing to pay a little less for something without directx 11 support but with an hdmi port .	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I like Corsair and there 's plenty of models to choose from at your source of supply .	St
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Your building your own , so your not stupid , and you believe in yourself ... that 's all i need to know.You 've read the specs on each part to insure compatibility .	St
1.3.2	I looked up what i 'd get on a $ 394 budget : -MSI MB w/o video.Has 4 RAM slots , and two PCI-X 16x slots .	St
1.3.3	$ 49 -AMD Phenom 3-Core 3.0GHz CPU..crap , out of stock for good .	St
1.3.4	$ 70 -Rosewill Green 700WT power supply w/crossfire .	St
1.3.5	$ 79 -1GB video card ( might grab two ) $ 68 ea -Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1000GB H.D .	St
1.3.6	$ 69 -G.SKILL Ripjaws 4GB DDR3 1600mhz RAM ( 2 sticks for now ) $ 59 Using my old hardware & operating system,4-bay case , burner , and roms .	St
1.3.7	[ NOT buying a 6-core CPU , too much $ ] $ 394 COMPLETE .	St
1.4.1	immune to making mistakes ( or just plain poor choices ) by mismatching RAM , CPU types/Sockets , PSUs , etc. , .	St
1.4.2	By posting here or elsewhere , at least they have a chance of someone spotting those errors and helping them avoid an incompatible product or find a compatible or better product for the use intended .	St
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	Sound like a good gaming pc , checkout my future build	St
1.6.1	I was n't giving the rookie a hard time ... .and yes , it 's smart to post even the dumbest of questions.The only stupid question is the one not asked .	St
1.6.2	It 's easy to misinterpret , or take text out of context ... one can sound snotty , or like a 'know it all ' when it was n't intended that way .	St
1.6.3	Your comment is fine , and sounded respectfull ... .maybe mine sounds snotty , if so , i apologize .	St
1.7.1	proposed new as well as upgrade configs where the CPU does n't go with the MB and more often where the RAM is DDR2 and MB only accepts DDR3 .	St
1.7.2	Also see a fair number of instances where the PSU does n't support the HW identified or if it worked ... it would n't have lasted long .	St
1.7.3	Wonder how the poster 's build went ?	Ques
1.7.4	Happy New Year VAPCMD	St
