Just got a laptop with Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B LAN PC Card that is supposed to give my laptop wireless capability. Questions: 1. Will this card work OK for hooking up to hotspots while roaming? 2. Does it work both 802.11b as well as 802.11g modes?

You will have the b capabilities, meaning your connection speed will be slower than a g connection. I found this and it might help to explain things better. The 802.11b wireless networking standard was the first widely available wireless networking solution that users could buy; the vast majority of public wireless spaces, including coffeehouses and restaurants and the like, use the 802.11b standard. It uses the 2.4 Ghz frequency for communication, and the fastest speed an 802.11b user can theoretically have is 11 Mbps. The 802.11a and 802.11g standards both offer a higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps. However, nearly half of that is used for routine communication between your computer and the wireless access point it's communicating with, not for transfer of your data requests. 24 Mbps is the highest speed that wireless cards are required to support. The 802.11a standard uses the 5.5 Ghz frequency, a signal which is less used by other devices (a bonus for wireless network users) but the signal strength drops off more quickly as you go farther from the access point. However, because there's less interference, it may be easier to design good 802.11a coverage than 802.11b or 802.11g coverage in a given area. All in all, though, 802.11a is currently the least common type of wireless network installation. The 802.11g standard shares the 2.4 Ghz frequency with the 802.11b standard, but 802.11g provides the higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps. Since they share the same frequency, many networking cards that support 802.11g also support 802.11b. This is good for users who travel from network to network, since 802.11b is still the most commonly available type of wireless networking. However, having a user with an 802.11b card in an 802.11g network slows the maximum speed of all the wireless network's users to the 11 Mbps 802.11b standard. Hope this helps. Rick
