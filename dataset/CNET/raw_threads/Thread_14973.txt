I want a device that can view pdf's and be able to zoom in on parts of the pdf if the text happens to be too small. This being said, browsing cookbooks is the only thing being done on the device so I don't need all the bells and whistles except for a large screen. Looking at something functional yet inexpensive. Hope you guys have some suggestions!

Just last week we picked up a refurb at geeks.com for about 240 and it's hard to beat the real thing when it comes to PDFs. I've used Android tablets but if you look around, some folk demand that all PDFs work so I have to go back to a PC. Bob
