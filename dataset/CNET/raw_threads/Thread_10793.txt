Many can't control their firewall and as such I withdraw any firewall support. Besides Zonelabs deserves that priviledge. In short, set up ICS and control that firewall. As to cheap routers, the cheapest was 10 dollar belkin unit on sale. My Wifi-G Dlink router was 25 bucks from compgeeks (plus some shipping) so deals are out there. Bob

Is your modem a USB device or a Ethernet model, you may require to install a network bridge if the modem is on ethernet.
