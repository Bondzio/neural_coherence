I get this message just once but it appear that none of my usb port seem to work. I run a WinXP Pro with SP2. I have read many discussion on how to mask the issue by disabling the error message but that does not help my port. Everything appear to be great when I check the ports from windows but it seem like there is absolutly no power coming out of it. I have a 680Watt power supply that I had just recently upgrade. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

I must ask why you didn't share details about the machine since I won't check in till tomorrow. Sorry if I was not blunt enough, but it does help in resolving this issue.

I have nothing plugged into my usb ports since none of them are working. As far as my bios is concern, I have upgrade it as far as it will go. My drivers are all up to date. I just never thought about using my usb ports until now.
