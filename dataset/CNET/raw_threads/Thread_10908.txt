I searched the forum, but found no solution to my particular problem. I'm having problems detecting my hard drive. Now, what I did: got a new 160Gig HD (my slave, D: ) and installed it. I was able to format (via: AdminTools &gt; Comp Mgmt &gt; Disk Mgmt) it and put some data onto it. I formatted and reinstalled WinXP Pro onto my master HD. Both were formated as NTFS. No Problem. Now, when I went to MyComputer, my D: didn't show up. I checked the jumpers, the BIOS and Device Manager, they all say the HD shows up/is running okay. Went back to the DiskMgmt screen and the HD is innactive. Right clicking on it prompts me to change it to a basic volume (which would delete everything) in order to use it - which I obviously can't do since I have some data I need on it. What can I do to view the drive???

This drives people to frantic states since many will install XP and such a drive will do as you wrote. Next the drive, if not partitioned with XP may indeed vanish. Bob
