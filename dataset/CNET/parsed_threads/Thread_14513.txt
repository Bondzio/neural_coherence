<s> My sister messed up her Bios out of ignorance, i thought, no problem, ill just take out the battery out of the motherboard for a few minutes and bios will reset settings, but it didn't. </s>
<s> Does anyone know an other way to reset bios settings? </s>
<s> PS: Why i can't change them back: the picture is al messed up and just has some weird lines on it. </s>
<s> What Operating system what type CPU, memory et al? </s>
<s> There should be a jumper on the mobo, located near that battery that is for the express purpose of resetting the BIOS to the default. </s>
<s> Move the jumper to the opposite position and turn off all power to the mobo [only sure way to remove the 5 volt standby power is to unplug the power supply, or turn it off by the switch on the rear]for a few minutes. </s>
<s> Then move the jumper back and turn the system on. </s>
<s> you removed the battery you may have inadvertantly removed some tension from the battery contact and now have a poor connection. </s>
<s> Check to be sure that you put the battery back in correctly. </s>
<s> Those button batteries need to go in with the positive + side up. </s>
<s> i don't understand why you should know more about the system, and i don't what it would help. </s>
<s> CPU:celeron 1ghz RAM:96mb video: on board motherboard: i dont know what kind this is but it has a phoenix bios i think i put the battery in right...i think but if you boot it up without battery it should just load default settings </s>
<s> BIOS without battery should be the default bios settings. </s>
<s> Your earlier post said that the display is just some lines. </s>
<s> Check the monitor on another PC to eliminate faulty monitor and try your pc with another monitor. </s>
<s> That should give you firm indications as to what is wrong. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> The monitor has allways worked fine and the image is screwed up since she changed the settings </s>
<s> BIOS settings and the display settings in WINDOWS are not related. </s>
<s> I think you are going about this in an odd way. </s>
<s> The usual? </s>
<s> -&gt; Boot Windows to SAFE MODE, set the settings you want there, OK it and ask Windows to reboot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The screen has weird lines on it at all times, even before windows is loaded, even in the bios. </s>
<s> ALL BIOS I've encountered in over 20 years sets the video to a safe 640x480 60Hz VGA display and before VGA, EGA, Mono would do the same. </s>
<s> You have a bum video card or display. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok ill try it with different display, but i dont think it'll help. </s>
<s> She set something from 16 bits to none...she says </s>
<s> Those words are what I see when WINDOWS is running. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> but don't think that zero would be a value. </s>
<s> Probably in the video settings not BIOS, but then again zero makes no sense, unless she changed the acceleration slider all the to the left. </s>
<s> Good luck solving this one Robert. </s>
<s> i found it very weird to, ill ask her again... </s>
<s> she did it from bios, im sure about that </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> OK but i can only update on saturday, when i see my sister. </s>
<s> jump back to the top of the first page from wherever it is when you make the post. </s>
<s> Hope that the answer lets you solve the problem. </s>
<s> Hi Tod, Just understand that the BIOS as factory set or Default HAS to work the monitor in the basic mode, i.e. </s>
<s> 640 x 480 resolution. </s>
<s> If it does not, then how does one even attempt any change or configuration of the BIOS in the first place? </s>
<s> Plz confirm that you monitor / PC video card is OK as suggested in my earlier post. </s>
<s> Incidentally, does your monitor have any control or controls that adjust the display Width or Height? </s>
<s> If yes, then you could try adjusting these and see if the display becomes stable. </s>
<s> The same, if there is any control for H-Sync or V-Sync, which is not likely unless the monitor is an old version or of a special make. </s>
<s> All the Best </s>
