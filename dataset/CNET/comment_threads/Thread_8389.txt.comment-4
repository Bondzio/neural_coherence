eck, I contacted gateway and they said they have no compatible upgrades on the market.. i saw a few at zipzoomfly.om that may be, but id ont wanna spend another 100+ for a slight upgrade, when i just spent 300 for a card..
I think i may try my hand at building a whole new 1. my 2 pc's are kinda old (hp1040n) and the gateway 503gr and i figure ill be needing a new 1 in the coming years to play games w/direct-x 10 and whatnot.
