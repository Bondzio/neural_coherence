As a contract facilitator at a skills training centre, where I teach level 1 computer studies; my stipend does not allow me to replace my system that crashed over six (6) months ago. I cannot even afford the cost of repair(it needs a new mother board and processor). I am also pursuing distance learning studies therefore you see that I am trying desperately to keep a positive attitude. Currently, school is out and so I borrow friends' system when they have a little downtime; which is usually infrequent and haphazard. Computer recycling programs that allow request from non-US citizens are yet to discovered; believe me I have tried. Is there someone out there who has a internet-ready system that they no longer need and are willing to donate? Thanks in advance.

It was like, why not give it to them instead of throw it away. I didn't reformat the hard drive however and the Windows kept my name as the registered owner. I was upset because the cd-rw drive wouldn't open so I got a new computer from Sears.com. Life is good. You should order a computer from geeks.com or something. Good luck. I don't think I could send a computer outside of my country, let alone my state. It would cost too much for me and take too much effort.
