1.1.1	Hello, Appreciate if someone could help me with a wireless connection question.	St
1.1.2	I am going on vacation in 2 weeks and there is only 1 place on the island that offers wireless internet access.	St
1.1.3	I have heard that it is possible to buy a wireless card that I can plug into my laptop in order to receive wireless access w/o having to go to the wifi hotspot.	St
1.1.4	(Would love to be able to catch up on work e-mails and participate in my fantasy draft without leaving the pool!)	St
1.1.5	Is this true?	St
1.1.6	If so any suggestions on the best product?	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	far enough away from any wireless broadband provider where that service would not exist.	St
1.2.2	At best those services provide dial-up type speed, not worth the cost if you ask me.	St
1.2.3	Enjoy your vacation and take a break away from the Internet, that's what I'm gonna try to do in two weeks.	St
