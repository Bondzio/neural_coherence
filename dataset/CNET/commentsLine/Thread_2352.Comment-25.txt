vinnyd85, try this!
what i did, and my problem originated from placing in a new harddrive.
wrote down any particular settings like 1024x767 and 60hz.
1) uninstalled the video driver for the monitor, and then reloaded from original cd (no fix?)
2) unistalled monitor from the computer (even disconnected it while powering up) and then reloaded monitor with cd (no fix?)
3) moved my video card...jest pressed down on it into the slot to ensure it was seated...
(fixed!)
4) did a few computer updates to ensure monitor would not have the same problem...worked great then 5) downloaded the most recent driver from ati radeon site (package installer) as their site doesn't have my ati radeon 9200 listed...updated using the full installer and still working great hope this helps puddle jumper
