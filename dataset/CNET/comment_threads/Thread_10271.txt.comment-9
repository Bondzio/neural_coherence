I found SSD to be treacherous in that not only the drive firmware must be current, but many machines require Intel's RST app to hit full steam.
Then again, the SSD maker can change the software to be more safe at the cost of some speed.
And finally we have the problem of laboratory conditions.
One poor soul had that CRACKED WINDOWS 7 and never could fix it.
Our theory is the crack wrecked havoc with the system.
And since we could get full speed from our install they were pissed at everyone about &quot;what carp is this, why can't you fix my system?&quot; They were treated as nicely as possible but that OS meant we could never tackle that system.
