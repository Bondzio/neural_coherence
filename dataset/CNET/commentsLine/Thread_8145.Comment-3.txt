gonna be building from scratch.
have an antec case slk3700 bqe, for atx or btx, with 350w power supply.
only parts i will be taking from my old system are a radeon 9800 pro 128mb, dvd rom 16x drive, cd r/rw drive, and wd 80gb - 7200rpm hd.
depending on whether i decide to get an agp board, or pci express board will make or break the radeon.
the $200 is for the motherboard only.
my main sticking point is agp or pci express...do i go for agp and what are my chances of being obsolete in the near future, or pci express and build the system slowly, as i can only afford to build it a piece at a time?
also will be installing new memory, not moving the old cards over.
