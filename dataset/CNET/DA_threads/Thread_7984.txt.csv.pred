1.1.1	Greetings- I've just installed a home network (Netgear router RP614v2, #1 PC running W/ME, #2 W/98, Cox Cable ISP) and all was well until we tried to play an online game (Electronic Arts &quot;Command and Conquer&quot;) at the same time.	St
1.1.2	We'd both get kicked out of the game (but remain on line and on the site).Upon further investigation I found that the game did not support ICS while playing online games.	St
1.1.3	The first work around suggested in the EA FAQ's was to disable ICS.	St
1.1.4	I tried to find clearer instructions but that was the extent of it.	St
1.1.5	The next possibility was: &quot;If ICS is enabled, enable ports 1234 and 1140 on the host machne as well.&quot; I'm confused as to the &quot;host machine&quot;, is that the PC in router slot #1?	St
1.1.6	The enabling steps are a mystery too.	St
1.1.7	The last suggestion was the most complicated, it involved downloading an ICSconfig program from http:lynx.neu.edu/a/arnccombs/ I downloaded it but, it showed Error Query Registry the &quot;Intranet IP Address&quot; box and in the &quot;Subnet Mask&quot; box and would not permitt me to proceed with the port assignments listed.	St
1.1.8	So, what should I do here?	St
1.1.9	Are there any C&C fans out there that have experienced and overcome this problem?	St
1.1.10	Thanks-	St
1.2.1	Sadly, the ICS note DOES NOT APPLY to those with routers.	St
1.2.2	Some games do not allow more than one user per INTERNET IP ADDRESS.	St
1.2.3	It's not cheap to fix that issue since you dump the router and pay almost double the cable bill a month for another IP address.	St
1.2.4	Sorry to see such an issue.	St
1.2.5	Try just one user and what happens?	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
