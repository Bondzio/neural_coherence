with that much running, that may be normal.
have you turned off the indexing service while will always have the hard disk working?
i see an odd nameserver in there too.
you should know what that is about.
finally, with such a machine, the latest motherboard drivers should be found, installed then the old xp trick of setting all channels to pio, then ok your way out then going back in and setting them to dma should be performed since you can't tell by looking.
