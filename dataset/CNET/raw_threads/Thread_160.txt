Does it run even longer? If so, there can be a cooling issue or some part has become heat sensitive. There are also cases where the power supply has aged and we fit a new bigger one. But the exact item to replace hasn't been found yet. Try a big fan... Bob

Whenever I played intensive games, shut down and turned the computer on afterwards, the power lights would go on but it wouldn't boot up. I took it to the tech shop and it turns out that the fan/heatsink I had was inadequate to properly cool the processor. The fact that the games run for half an hour and simply crash really makes me think it is a heating issue.

The only meaning I get from them is that the PC needs repair. Sadly there are a lot of badly made PCs out there. Some are assembled improperly without heatsink compound. (A favorite find of mine.) bob
