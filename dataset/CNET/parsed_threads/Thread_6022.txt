<s> I have a Verizon Fios network with an ActionTec router. </s>
<s> To it I have connected my Dell Windows XP Pro desktop and Canon printer (both with Ethernet cables). </s>
<s> Wirelessly connected, I have a Belkin Skype phone, a Dell Vista Ultimate laptop, and I used to have an HP Ipaq 4350. </s>
<s> My wireless network successfully recognized all of the above devices until about 2 weeks ago and then it seemingly cannot see the HP Ipaq, even though the Ipaq says it has successfully connected to the network. </s>
<s> (I have listed all of the wireless devices Mac addresses in the network so that they alone have access to the wireless network.) </s>
<s> I have tried many things. </s>
<s> I did a network reset but that did not resolve the problem. </s>
<s> I renamed the network to see if there was something lingering in memory someplace that was causing the problem. </s>
<s> Is there anything that I can do to rectify the situation? </s>
<s> The settings for the Ipaq Network Authentication are: Checked Data encryption (WEP enabled) Unchecked Network authentication (shared mode) Checked The Key is provided for me automatically. </s>
<s> There is a Network Key (represented by stars) Key index is listed as 1 Checked Enable network access using IEEE 802.1x EAP Type is listed as TLS but additional options are PEAP Under properties there is a warning message: Cannot log on to the wireless network. </s>
<s> This network requires a personal certificate to positively identify you. </s>
<s> This must be the problem, but if I have put in my MAC address for this device, what more is wanted. </s>
<s> How do I provide this personal certificate? </s>
<s> Any help greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> Thate is no security at all today with WEP+MAC addresses so why not move to WPA? </s>
