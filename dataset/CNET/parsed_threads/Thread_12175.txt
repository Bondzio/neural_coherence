<s> I've been reading these pages till my brain hurts. </s>
<s> There's so much info here. </s>
<s> I bought a Maxtor Personal Storage 3200, but when I opened it there wasn't any instructions, installation disc, or anything come up on the screen when I plugged it into the laptop. </s>
<s> There's also no buttons or switches on the HD case. </s>
<s> The 2 seemed to be talking to each other OK, so I tried to format & partition it into an 80/120/120G but it didn't do that, just stayed as 1 partition but with the name I'd given the first partition. </s>
<s> The wizard seemed to be working OK so I figure there's a lot more I don't know about. </s>
<s> On this forum I found reference to a program Acronis Migrate Easy. </s>
<s> So my question is:- would the Acronis be the best way to go to manage the external HD right from the get go? </s>
<s> I bought the HD with the intention of having a full backup, duplicate of my laptop, programs & all, which I would rebackup from time to time. </s>
<s> I also note some say to use CD's but it would take 26 of them just to B-up my laptop, let alone have extra for my movies, music, etc!!!! </s>
<s> That's crazy! </s>
<s> Very important individual files, yes definately. </s>
<s> OK the laptop details. </s>
<s> OS XP Pro sp2, pentium 2GHZ, 60G. </s>
<s> Um not sure what else you need to know here. </s>
<s> Thanks ClissaT </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Look up SYNCBACK and use it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Acronis is nice. </s>
<s> Sorry there are no instructions but the full retail version is cheap and worth it. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> And most important. </s>
<s> This is not backup. </s>
<s> It's an convenient copy. </s>
<s> To reach the point of BACKUP we need one more copy that is WRITE PROTECTED. </s>
<s> These are not my rules on what backup is but those handed down over the years and accepted by many the world over. </s>
<s> If you feel one copy of your files (that's one copy regardless how many times you put it on this drive!) </s>
<s> is all you need then I implore you to read this forum where people plead for help getting their files off such a device. </s>
<s> Where's the backup? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> external ? </s>
<s> Through 'Disk Management' ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'll look up SYNCBACK. </s>
<s> I understand the final backup should be 'once only use' CD's. </s>
<s> Mainly I would like a copy of this computer because I can't remember all the programs & 100's of hours of updates to goodness knows what that just happen of their own volitition. </s>
<s> I wouldn't know where to start to discribe what's on this computer (I've totally lost track!). </s>
<s> So figured a copy would at least give me a starting point should this machine go AWOL. </s>
<s> CT </s>
<s> to coincide with your proposed strategy. </s>
<s> Like you, I want to back it all up and restore it all in as little time as possible if the primary drive should become corrupt beyond repair or fail. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend time finding all the CDs, the product keys, reloading the OS, the MB and periperhal drivers, all the application software, set all the defaults etc., etc.,. </s>
<s> Makes me tired even thinkin' about it. </s>
<s> I create compressed, restorable images of my drive C (OS and APPs) and D (ALL DATA) to a second internal HDD. </s>
<s> I also put copies of those images on an external HDD as well. </s>
<s> It has really really served my well. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks VAPCMD, now it's all making sense. </s>
<s> I often find the HELP menu doesn't give all the info required. </s>
<s> It didn't say the active window of the installed external harddrive had to show unallocated space before partitions could be made. </s>
<s> There was no mention of deleting partitions to make it all unallocated. </s>
<s> There was no mention of the words 'unallocated space'. </s>
<s> To my mind that was the most important piece of info that should've been in the HELP menu !! </s>
<s> Of course it would also help if the device came with a few instructions of it's own ! </s>
<s> I'm finding more & more that device makers assume buyers know about everything these days. </s>
<s> Anyway all done now & I have a copy of the computer to put away just incase. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for your help here. </s>
<s> You have the right idea but do not use disks ; they involve a lot of swapping back & forth & if one gets a little scratch you wind up with a set of 'coasters'. </s>
<s> Use the Maxtor +flash drive. </s>
<s> Your help on the Maxtor should be on the disk itself. </s>
<s> By opening it from 'my computer' you will see them. </s>
<s> If not there you can download them from Maxtor/Seagate (who brought Maxtor. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> As a Storage/Backup Engineer for a large international company, we have a running joke. </s>
<s> No one cares whether you do backups. </s>
<s> All they care to see are successful restores. </s>
<s> Point is - unless you are doing something to ensure that whatever method you are using to backup/copy your data is &quot;reversible&quot;, i.e. </s>
<s> unless you are capable of getting that data back in a usable format, then all the backups in the world are of no value. </s>
<s> So don't just backup - perform test restores of that data on a regular basis. </s>
<s> Hi, I did the same thing as you. </s>
<s> I bought an external hard disc and I'd like to have everything I have on my laptop on the extra disc in case this computer goes belly-up. </s>
<s> What did you find worked for you? </s>
<s> Do you have to partition drives? </s>
<s> Is there a reason people partition drives? </s>
<s> I'd appreciate your advice since you just went through it. </s>
<s> I guess it's technically a backup in the cmoputer world, but it's a fall-back position for me. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
