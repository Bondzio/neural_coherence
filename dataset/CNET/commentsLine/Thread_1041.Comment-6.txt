first off, i don't know what a os is... sorry bout that!
^_^ second of all... i believe the cable is running to the modem, then another cable is not plugged into the phone jack (or it looks like one) but plugged into another socket that looks like a square with another half-size square inside it.
then &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; cable runs into the front of my compaq computer (if that helps any) right next to the floppy drive.
it plugs into one of two vertical rectagular sockets.
that's all i really know about it.
