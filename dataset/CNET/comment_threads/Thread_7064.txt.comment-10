chrishandyman, Thanks for your reply.
I'll check out the Epson, but I think the ink is a little expensive.
As I said, I have a friend who has an Epson and it needs to 'go to the well' rather frequently!
I have had a few problems with stick on labels, which is why I posted my question.
(I've also had a problem answering more than one post at a time!
The forum won't accept this, so I have to exit and reenter to answer each post!)
Regards, Colinito
