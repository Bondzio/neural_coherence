<s> I just bought a Maxtor &quot;Diamond Max&quot; 200GB internal hard drive and became frustrated with the installation. </s>
<s> The instructions state that you MUST create a bootable floppy disk with the ATA drivers for Windows XP. </s>
<s> That would be fine, except that my computer has no floppy drive. </s>
<s> The directions suggest that you use a temporary plug-in external floppy drive for this purpose....great. </s>
<s> I had to drive 20 miles to buy the drive...now I have to go back and buy a floppy drive so that I can install it? </s>
<s> My question is this. </s>
<s> Are ALL internal hard drives like that? </s>
<s> Do they all require a floppy disk boot? </s>
<s> I'd rather buy and install a different hard drive at this point. </s>
<s> The thing is, Maxtor didn't include &quot;floppy drive&quot; in the specs listed on the box, so I thought I'd be fine. </s>
<s> Now I'm scared to purchase any of them. </s>
<s> Please help? </s>
<s> The hard drive is what model number? </s>
<s> What is the make and model of the computer? </s>
<s> With a proper installation of Windows XP, there is no extra driver installation required. </s>
<s> The exception is sometimes when you need to install a Serial ATA (SATA) driver to use an SATA hard drive, but that driver would come from your PC or motherboard maker. </s>
<s> There are some Maxtor hard drive tools (MaxBlast, PowerMax, et al.) </s>
<s> that may be helpful, but they are not drivers and are not required. </s>
<s> * * * * * Once the hard drive is installed, you can partition and format it in DISK MANAGEMENT. </s>
<s> Also, there are some Maxtor hard drive models that require a firmware upgrade to work properly in some computers. </s>
<s> It's simply an issue with Microsoft's OS that didn't include drivers and we are paying the price. </s>
<s> For PATA (you didn't tell) drives we don't have this issue since SATA arrived after Windows XP. </s>

<s> I installed a WD 10,000 rpm Sata Drive and I had to make a floppy boot drive with the Sata drivers on it. </s>
<s> That was installed on XP. </s>
<s> The other three hard drives or Maxtor IDE 7200 rpm and they did not require boot up Floppy to run them, But I had to set up Bios so I could run raid and Sata. </s>
<s> And I had to get the drivers from the MB disc that came with the MB Raid drivers. </s>
<s> The Raid driver were installed when I got to my desktop. </s>
<s> Good Luck Wendell H </s>
