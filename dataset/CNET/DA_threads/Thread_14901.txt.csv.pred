1.1.1	at 2.19 Gh.	St
1.1.2	Both running on the same brand and model motherboard with exactly the same settings.	St
1.1.3	Did I get con'd by Newegg and receive a 3000+ that somehow displays 3200+ in the system screen?	St
1.2.1	Oooops.	St
1.2.2	My mistake, the CPU came from ZipZoomFly rather than Newegg.	St
1.3.1	the fact that you can't hit perfect speeds...it's like 10MHZ off dude just run CPU-Z on each one, you'll see what i'm talking about your FSB won't be dead on even 200MHZ, it'll be like 199.98 or something and it's causing that slight differential, I wouldn't worry about it	St
1.4.1	I concur with Ozos.	St
1.4.2	Think about it this way: If processor clock speed fully translated into a full system speed gain on a linear basis for all operations, you would have a 0.45% loss.	St
1.4.3	Not noticeable.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	&quot;except that it isn't/doesn't&quot; If you mean the subjunctive linear correlating of processor clock speed and full system speed, you are correct.	St
1.6.2	I was just submitting the worst case scenario, so as relieve martylk2's concern.	St
1.6.3	We're on the same page.	St
1.7.1	that 10MHZ doesn't matter spending that much time to calculate out the differences is worthless the processor doesn't show the full power of the system, it's what the combined controllers and equipment in any single device can achive, you could build clones of one design and one of them may outperform the other by a good strech	St
1.8.1	I agree, again.	St
1.8.2	People ask for help in these forums.	St
1.8.3	I was trying to be a nice guy by typing a few characters in Excel (it was really fast) to show that, in relative terms, it did not matter for a 2.2GHz processor.	St
1.8.4	Ten MHz does, indeed, matter a lot if the processor in question is supposed to be a 33MHz processor-thats why I posted the relative numbers.	St
1.8.5	I wasnt trying to show you up by saying you were wrong, but was trying to provide another perspective.	St
1.8.6	You know, as well as I, that there are people who dont know GHz from Hertz Rent-a-Car.	St
1.9.1	i'm not trying to say you were attempting to show me up, i'm just saying most people are going to sit and scratch their head going &quot;what in the heck is he talking about?&quot;	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	You didn't say what MB or which AMD64.	St
1.11.2	They are different cores in play that have different mulitpliers.	St
1.11.3	John	St
1.12.1	they are both Barton with the same multiplier the 3200+ AMD64 isn't 2.2GHZ, it's 2.0	St
1.13.1	Asus A7N8X, Athlon XP 3200+ - Barton core.	St
1.13.2	Oddly enough, my desktop, which I purchased from Velocity Micro fully assembled, was running at 2.21 GH.	St
1.13.3	My other desktop, which I built, was running at 2.19 GH.	St
1.13.4	In the BIOS there is an option to set the CPU frequency to aggressive.	St
1.13.5	I did so on my &quot;self built&quot; one which brought the CPU speed up to 2.20 GH.	St
1.13.6	My VM, which was running at 2.21 GH, I set it to aggressive also.	St
1.13.7	It went down to 2.20 GH.	St
1.13.8	I then set both machines back to default - optimal.	St
1.13.9	They both now run at 2.20 GH - strange.	St
1.14.1	no great &quot;sky falling&quot; event.	St
1.14.2	Thanks for all of the help in understanding the situation.	St
