the major limitation of the integrated video is not the 250mb memory but the processing power - which will definitely not handle the latest games, nor a good many older ones.
if the computer has an empty pcie slot, then you can add the video card of your choice at any time.
there are just two things to check out: (1) is there room for the particular card you want?
- some are quite long, (2) some high end cards draw a lot of power, so you should check that your power supply unit is adequate.
i bought my computer with integrated graphics because the price was good.
i used it for everything but games, no problem.
several months later, i added an nvidia 9800gt card.
this has been good for all the games i've thrown at it so far.
