the wd raptors have all been good but wouldn't buy a caviar right now.
i had mixed luck with the old ibm deskstars or &quot;deathstars&quot; as i have heard them called.
they were terrific drives as long as they worked.... they just didn't work long enough.
i've a couple from hitachi (which took over the business from ibm).
these have been decent.
it's been at least 4 years since my last hd failure.
i suppose just saying that will be the voice of doom.
