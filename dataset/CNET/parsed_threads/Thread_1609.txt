<s> I have ordered a Dell m1330 with a 64 gb SSd drive. </s>
<s> My thought was to buy an external 2.5&quot; drive and enclosure using USB. </s>
<s> I realized that the Dell has SATAII but no port. </s>
<s> Can I use an express card with SATA ports to connect with the Dell for data and use an external power supply for power or use a usb connector for power. </s>
<s> Any specific hardware suggestions? </s>
<s> Will it work? </s>
<s> Hard drive suggestions 320gb? </s>
<s> Enclosure suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I suggest you keep with USB devices and if possible use an ext. </s>
<s> power source for stable output. </s>
<s> This will reduce power demands on the laptops own psu and provide a longer life as such. </s>
<s> The added benefit is any USB device will more generically be mobile to other systems vs the eSATA as has limited support for now. </s>
<s> The decision is yours to best fit your needs though. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> It seems that the primary use for external drives is data backup. </s>
<s> USB max speed is 480 Mb/s and the sata is 3000 Mb/s. </s>
<s> I want to have max speed for I/O operations due to a small but very speedy SSD drive. </s>
<s> Most of the separate enclosures with SATA connections also have USP ports for data and/or power. </s>
<s> Your point is correct that the USB allows use with other slower computers but this should be available with the box hooked up USB. </s>
<s> But be aware that many owners can't handle setting up the usual OS for Sata support. </s>
<s> I've found forum support to result in pain all around on this issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It seems your main thrust is speed, USB simply is more generic to be accepted by more systems than eSATA. </s>
<s> If you need(desire) both ports in a ext. </s>
<s> case, google for such(USB and eSATA ext. </s>
<s> case). </s>
<s> When using custom or adapter type situations expect some problems to crop-up one way or another, maybe not in this case though. </s>
<s> Like i mentioned before do what best suits ya. </s>
