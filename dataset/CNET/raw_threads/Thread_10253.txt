It's pointless. Get PCI Express for the bandwidth and future proofing. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813135176 ^ has AGP and DDR2 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131542 ^ has PCI Express and DDR2 konny

A) it's not PCI-X, PCI-X is 64-bit PCI running at 66MHZ, 100MHZ or 133MHZ and is used for enterprise level add in cards such as $1000 RAID controllers B) your thinking of PCIE (also called PCIe or PCI-E) which is another interface avliable for server boards that has recently been ported to consumer level equipment for graphics, it allows SLi or CrossFire if you have the following: A) a chipset that supports it B) graphics cards that support it C) a motherboard that supports it D) a power supply that can handle it your post is mostly wrong and he did state the CPU he was consider the Pentium 4 3.6GHZ
