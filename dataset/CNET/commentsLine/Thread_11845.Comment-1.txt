my linksys befsr41 router recently stopped working.
i cannot log into it, it cannot be pinged, the &quot;diagnostic&quot; led is constantly on and no matter how many times i reset it i get nothing.
before i send it to the scrapyard and buy a new one, has anyone else had this issue and is it fixable?
