1.2.1	sorry , i copied this from my post on another forum and for some reason it doubled the post .	St
1.3.1	On FREECYCLE I see free CRT monitors weekly it seems .	St
1.3.2	So the display could be a freebie too .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	well first off i 've never heard of Freecycle , lol .	St
1.4.2	secondly a CRT would be too big to put on my desk .	St
1.5.1	The class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues .	St
1.5.2	The Athlon core would vaporize in a split second ( watch http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=cCmai6Q9DoM ) and far too many had the BAD CAPS issue .	St
1.5.3	Unless you can get it all for free it 's not a good deal .	St
1.5.4	It would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside .	St
1.5.5	If you want something small and nice I 'll share I picked up that 350 buck Acer Aspire One .	St
1.5.6	It 's been a hoot .	St
1.5.7	Bob	St
1.6.1	I 've run an athlon core for like 4 years with no problems .	St
1.6.2	it will only vaporise if im retarded and take off the heatsink when its on .	St
1.7.1	Having seen this machine class at the shop counters far too often my advice is to not spend a dime to get it working .	St
1.7.2	If you get it all working FOR FREE then you can decide to upgrade the display , etc .	St
1.7.3	Remember you are asking for opinions and I 'm sharing mine freely .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	i think what i 'll do is this : Buy the RAM , put the whole thing together and sell it .	St
1.8.2	Maybe on ebay or in a local paper .	St
1.8.3	Just sell it as tower only and all i 'll have to buy is the RAM .	Sug
1.8.4	i could definitely sell the tower for more than the price i paid for the RAM .	Sug
1.8.5	its a good moneymaking scheme	St
