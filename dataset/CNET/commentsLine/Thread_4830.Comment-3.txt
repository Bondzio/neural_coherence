psu: coolmax 650w model # nw-650b o/s: vista 64 bit ram: unknown manufacturer - 4gb (4x1gb) ddr2 pc5300 now in regards to the bios... i've flashed the bios 8 times in the past 2 days, due to pc instability.
i've used version 5001 last night, and even though it performed better fps wise; it was unstable and caused my system to crash while loading into the game or into a mission... so i'm back to using v1604 beta only because that is the most stable bios version that i've found, i've tried: v2302, v2001, & v1705; but again, went back to using v1604... i will upgrade my drivers via your posts, and also i have heard about the sound card thing.. i was going to try it last night, but unfortunately, i didn't have one laying around, so i'll go up to walmart tonight and get a cheapy that way i can return it if it doesn't help... but i am willing to try anything at this point.
in regards to the amd fusion, i do have that installed, and use the &quot;online gaming&quot; profile to shut down unnecessary background services and programs.
and yes that does help, to my surprise... on average in an explorable area without fusion running, it's around 40fps; with fusion running it's around 60fps and with that running is when i saw an fps of 115. so that i know works, and will recommend it to anyone with a compatible cpu.
