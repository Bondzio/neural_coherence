your two raptors would be setup as primary master drive.
you can use the larger drive as a slave to either primary or secondary depending on how your cd/dvd, cdrw, dvdrw is connected.
i run 2x40g in raid 0 as primary master, primary slave is cd/dvd-rom, secondary master is cdrw-rom and secondary slave is a 46g hard drive.
