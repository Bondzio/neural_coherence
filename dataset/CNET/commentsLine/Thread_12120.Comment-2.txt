all paper stock has a &quot;pound&quot; rating.
get your cardstock poundage and then check the specs on the printers under consideration.
be aware that consumer printers that don't do photos will likely not be in the usual store shelves.
i also see multifunction printers for under 99 bucks that last about 2 years.
why isn't that aceptable?
in closing i set up the office and home with the hp k550.
for scanning we use a scanner.
