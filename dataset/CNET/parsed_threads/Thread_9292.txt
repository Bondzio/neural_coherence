<s> Hi Everybody, I have got a bluetooth print server (Nortek, BT 500). </s>
<s> The user manual doesn't contain pairing code. </s>
<s> (The serial number or the MAC address doesn't work! </s>
<s> The manufacturer's WEB page also doesn't work: www.nortekonline.com ) I've tried the following codes: BT500 NORTEK 1A N44066-00054 (serial number) N44066-000541A (serial number end two past char at the box) 0000 00000 00054 44066 N44066 0003C9 72BA1C (MAC address) 0003C9 72BA1C 0003C972BA1C 12345 ADMIN etc. </s>
<s> Any idea? </s>
<s> Thanks, Sandorh </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/40811-43-nortek-bluetooth-print-server-pairing-code It appears you replied and it seems they guessed it. </s>
<s> Dear Proffitt, that also is my question at an another forum. </s>
<s> I am searching the real solution for a while... By, Sandorh </s>
<s> That other post ends with you giving them a thank you. </s>
<s> If that was not the correct answer then you should have said that that code wasn't working for you. </s>
<s> Me? </s>
<s> I author some apps that use BlueTooth so I know a little about this. </s>
<s> But for a specific device like this you go back to the maker if the usual codes fail and there is no manual. </s>
<s> And if the product is defective (no manual is a defective) we know to toss it and get something better. </s>
<s> And then we have those no code pairing systems. </s>
<s> That would send the person who believes there is a code in a forever search for that non-existent paring code! </s>

<s> Hi, In my country the 'Thank you' is not equal 'Right' or 'Ok, it is working'. </s>
<s> Thank you for the answer, but your advice does not work. </s>
<s> Ok, I am understand your logical answer. </s>
<s> But... </s>
<s> This equipment was very cheap and offered a god solution for obsolete only-USB-port printers to make them network printers. </s>
<s> The manufacturer WEB page does not work, so I am not able to give help from support team. </s>
<s> I can send back this equipment to dealer, but I want to solve this problem. </s>
<s> The manual is complete and correct, but does not contain any information about bluetooth paring code. </s>
<s> So, you are right, maybe I drop this device into dust-bin. </s>
<s> ('Thank you for your time'), Bye: Sandorh </s>
<s> Here's an example in case you didn't know. </s>
<s> -&gt; https://www.google.com/search?q=non-passworded+bluetooth+devices This again throws folk for a loop. </s>
<s> I don't expect you to know all the ins and outs of BlueTooth but as you can imagine, this can stump those that didn't know. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I read the referenced articles, but I didn't identify my case... most likely it is my mistake.I saved the pictures of the installation process. </s>
<s> I can scan the user manual, and I can send it for you. </s>
<s> How can I send them for you? </s>
<s> Sandorh </s>
<s> This no code pairing is not supported on some Android units and maybe some versions of Windows. </s>
<s> But it's quite odd you are writing the word &quot;installation&quot; now. </s>
<s> Your posts were asking about &quot;pairing.&quot; One thing is not the other. </s>
