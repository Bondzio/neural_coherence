11782	11	245547	2475411	2475380	ramarc	5/2/07 7:38 am	1.17809148e12	a 65w x2 has lower power draw than a e6300	performance per watt is about the only area that amd has a consistent lead of intel.

11782	13	245547	2476303	2475238	everwanted2	5/3/07 1:00 am	1.178154e12	i would go with the amd	i was in the same quandary just last week for the same two desktops. i even bought the 6030 but returned as soon as i found an open box at sams club for an hpm7767c, e6600 processor, 2 gigs ram, 600 gb harddrive, nvidia 7500, and a 22 inch monitor for a spanking 849.99!!! the the e6300 beats the amd in many areas, and vice versa. but i still would have gone with the amd for its more stylish casing, graphics card, and faster baseline processor speed.
