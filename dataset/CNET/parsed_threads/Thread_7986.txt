<s> Hey all, I've got a question that I need help with. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq Presario, an older one, 1.5 GHz Desktop. </s>
<s> It's got 1 GB memory, 1 40 GB hard drive, 1 320 GB hard drive, a CD Rom drive and a DVD Rom drive. </s>
<s> Recently I left the PC on to run a scan for spyware, viruses, etc. </s>
<s> I came back later and the PC seemed to run very slow. </s>
<s> I shut it down and started it up and it took what seemed like forever to boot up. </s>
<s> When I got to Windows, XP by the way, I clicked on My Computer. </s>
<s> It would not display the drives. </s>
<s> It seemed like it was taking a long time to do anything. </s>
<s> I shut it down again. </s>
<s> The next start up again took forever to boot up. </s>
<s> I finally decided to check the BIOS. </s>
<s> It opens and I can see the 40 GB HD, the CD and DVD Rom. </s>
<s> The BIOS does seem to recognize that the 320 GB is there but it does not show what type of drive it is. </s>
<s> The 40 GB is the master and the 320 GB is the slave by the way. </s>
<s> If I remove the 320 GB HD from the system all together and just boot with the 40 GB it runs fine. </s>
<s> As soon as I add the 320 GB back it seems to take forever to try and locate it. </s>
<s> It will say Locating IDE drives and just sit there. </s>
<s> Eventually it will start up but the 320 GB drive is not accessable or the PC runs so slow that I can't get it to do anything. </s>
<s> So my question is, is this hard drive corrupt and can I recover any data or is it a physical hard drive problem? </s>
<s> What can I do to save this hard drive or save the data? </s>
<s> Rich </s>
<s> Are free and free to try (trialware) software to look at said drive. </s>
<s> Be sure to get what files you can off that drive and then see if the drive's maker has a test program to test that drive (usually called SMART testing.) </s>
