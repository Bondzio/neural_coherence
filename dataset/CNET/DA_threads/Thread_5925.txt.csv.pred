1.1.1	This might be a very stupid question .	Polite
1.1.2	but i dont get it .	St
1.1.3	dual core is supposed to be twice as fast , so if dual core is 2.6GHz does that mean its really 5.2Ghz ?	Ques
1.1.4	if not how do you figure out if your PC can run a certain game or something ?	Ques
1.1.5	because its all chaos to ME ! ! ! !	St
1.1.6	please someone dumb it down for me example : game is recommended 3.0 GHz and you have a dual core AMD 5000 ( 2.6 ) does that mean it is not fast enough ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6121_102-0.html ? forumID=45 & threadID=236940 & messageID=2421707	St
1.3.1	The 5000+ part means that it would be equivalent to a 5.0 GHz Pentium I believe is the idea .	St
1.3.2	Thus that AMD 5000 is more than fast enough for a game recommending 3.0 GHz .	St
1.4.1	so why a game might me choppy is becuase of ... .. video card ?	Ques
1.5.1	Another would be memory limitations as it may be that if your computer is running a bunch of other things then the game may not be able to fit all the memory it needs in RAM and cause some swapping with the hard drive that may make a game choppy .	St
1.5.2	Also there is the possibility that the system is getting too hot and so it shifts things into a slower gear to generate less heat .	St
1.5.3	There could also be compatibility issues if you are trying to play a 32 bit game on a 64 bit system possibly .	St
1.5.4	Lastly , some games could be choppy due to bugs that still have n't been worked out completely so there is n't just one answer .	St

1.6.1	so how can you tell if a game or system is 32- or 64 bit ?	Ques
1.7.1	The market has spoken on what PC owners have today .	St
1.7.2	No game maker will issue a 64-bit only game yet .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	64 bit operating systems will say they are like XP 64 though Vista also has 64 bit versions you 'd have to intentionally have this installed as 32 bit is much more common .	St
1.8.2	Similarly you 'd have to go out of your way to find one of the few games that would have a version optimized for 64 bit computing .	St
1.8.3	Regards , JB	St
