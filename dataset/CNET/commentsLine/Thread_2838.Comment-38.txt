perhaps an adaptec....i've got several and they work with any hard disk drive and any capacity up to 1tb.
they've discontinued selling them but they're still available at retail shops....suggest starting with froogle to get a good price... here's the adaptec web where you can get the model numbers:  exactly what seagate model is it...assume its pata ?
