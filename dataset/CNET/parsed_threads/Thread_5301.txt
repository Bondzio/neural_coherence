<s> Hello, I recently purchased an old HPE-210Y Desktop with the ATI Radeon HD5450 graphics card installed. </s>
<s> I would like to have a large screen display for the desktop, but I want it to be clear and to fit proportionality on the monitor screen. </s>
<s> I am currently considering buying a 29 inch LCD monitor display or a 32 inch LED 720p Television. </s>
<s> I was hoping someone on this forum could provide me with guidance as to which purchase would be a better option. </s>
<s> I do not play video games, but I do watch a lot of You Tube videos and surf the net. </s>
<s> The desktop also has a blue ray player. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Here is the link to the HP website that contains the computer specifications. </s>
<s> LCD is generally regarded as CCFL back lit LCD where as LED LCD means that LEDs back light the LCD. </s>
<s> OLED is your true LED system but you know that. </s>
<s> Skip/ignore 720p for now and there is little to zero difference when it comes to LED/CCFL &quot;clarity&quot;. </s>
<s> Clarity is all about the LCD panel and possibly the protective cover (gloss = clarity but you know the drawbacks.) </s>

<s> The better TVs are going to have the resolution you want. </s>
<s> as for brands and what model and all that, you're left with buying better TV as in better than 720, that's old stuff now. </s>
<s> I suggest anything that starts better than 720 is going to provide what you need. </s>
<s> The 5450 video ports should offer both HDMI and SVGA/DVI or all, just be sure that it connects w/o ANY!!!! </s>
<s> adapter to make this a better match. </s>
<s> I also find you will need to tell the TV where the media stream is coming from but that goes with any TV in most respects. </s>
<s> Last, you may want a huge TV, but most 32in. </s>
<s> will do the job fine IMHO. </s>
<s> Once you get beyond 32in. </s>
<s> you maybe pushing it unless you have true hi-end video components, etc.. </s>
<s> It may display and all, but for how long and/or sustain it all. </s>
<s> Of course, just buy the true PC monitor, but those TVs really make a great display. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
