9120	0	266409	2597354	NR	kazicameron	10/2/07 11:44 AM	1.19132544E12	help on my CPU vs GPU	i have a dell pentium d i945express chipset 2 gb ram 7800 gt 512mb OC I want the 8800 gtx for the upcoming crysis so i looked at a new core 2 duo chip but aparently it wont work on my motherboard so i shall build my own system next year. The thing is i can afford the 8800 GTX now (with a new 600 watt power unit). I get bottleneck at the moment on my current card. so of course i would get bottleneck on the 8800 but will i see any performance increase because of this bottleneck or will the card take the load from the CPU? many thanks in advance kazicameron

The Cpu will bottleneck the GTX. Though games that are very graphic intensive will raise the fps quite a bit. But its not worth using a outdated CPU with a top of the line card.
