the prob is more than likely the 32 gig limit jumper on the back,will assume u have changed the jumpers and placed it in the wrong place that is all; common mistake to make on new sata drives failing that do a full bios reset on your motherboard (check your manual how to short the jumper needed to do this) then check that when you format the hd you use ntfs format
