Hi, I'm interested in upgrading the graphics card in my new desktop and I'm not 100% sure on what to get.
I've been looking into this but am new to PC gaming.
One card that has caught my attention is a GTX 660ti.
What's your opinion on the card?
If you approve of this card, what specific third party card should I purchase?
If you Do Not agree with me getting this card, what would you recommend around the same price of 660ti?
Also, what brand/manufacturer should I purchase a power supply from for the new graphics card?
Many thanks for the information and time taken to help.. Specs: 3rd Gen Intel Core i7-3770 processor 8GB DDR3 memory, expandable to 16GB.
