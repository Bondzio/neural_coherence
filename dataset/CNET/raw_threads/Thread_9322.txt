When I burn some movie files, I get &quot;break-Ups&quot; during the last 2-3 minutes when I play it back on my home DVD players (plays ok on my PC). I have tried Nero, ImgBurn, DVD Shrink,Magic DVD Copier burning software, but still have this problem (not on every file burned). I use good quality media (Memorex,Magnavox,HP, etc). I burn at slow speeds (2.5x). I just can't figure out what is wrong. My burner hardware is less than a year old. I would appreciate your comments and/or suggestions. Ray

Again, it doesn't happen with every movie I burn. Sometimes the movie will play ok, but will exhibit the problem the next time I try to play it.

Also, burn the media at 1/2 the media speed or 1/2 the drive speed, whichever is lower to get the best results. I'll share I gifted 2 players because of this issue and replaced it with a Philips DVD DIVx capable player. That one lists DVDR media so there is no question about support. Bob
