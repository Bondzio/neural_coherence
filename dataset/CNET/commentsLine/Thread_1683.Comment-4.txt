thanks for a good point but i wanna tell u that i have 1 gb ram,and brand new series of gma3ooo having 256 mb video memory.when i benchmarked pc ,memory scored 16500 which was the best score i have seen ever.isnt gma3000 is compitable???????????
intel mobo q965 also have same gma3000 graphics and g965 have gmax3000.thats why i m saying that gma3000 is a new series.isn,t it????
