I have a couple of WD Raptor drives and can say that these &quot;seem&quot; to be quicker than even my IBM Deskstars (some call them &quot;Deathstars&quot;) which were said to be the IDE champions before the WD upped theirs to 8 megs of cache.
I notice the difference, however, only when performing specific tasks which clock time such as backup events.
What I think we need to remember is that IDE /ATA drives underwent a metamorphasis over it's life and got faster and faster as the technology improved with competition for sales.
SATA should do the same but is in it's infancy now.
As your ATA drives die out, the SATAs do offer some small benefits now so I would not avoid them if your MB supports them natively.
I would not go out and by a PCI add in card just to accommodate the new drives because these will probably never be impressive and are not inexpensive.
