1.1.1	My mother in law just bought an AO725 .	St
1.1.2	She is totally lost on Windows 8 .	St
1.1.3	I am attempting to install XP Pro , which is what she is familiar with .	St
1.1.4	I have installed XP on many Acer Netbooks which came with Windows 7 , but I cant make any progress here .	St
1.1.5	The setup program always stops with error 7B .	St
1.1.6	I have tried using the IDE mode for the HD ( BIOS setting ) , and just about every AMD SATA driver I can find .	St
1.1.7	Neither of these methods seem to help .	St
1.1.8	I have also tried XP Pro SP1 , SP2 and SP3 .	St
1.1.9	I thought installing the 1.05 BIOS might help ( it came with 2.04 ) , but it will not install .	St
1.1.10	Using & quot ; Free DOS & quot ; I can run the ACER BIOS flash program ZHG105.exe .	St
1.1.11	Initially the 1.05 update program would give a flash write error .	St
1.1.12	I was able to reflash with the 2.04 BIOS successfully .	St
1.1.13	This did not help with the XP install ( no change ) , and after doing that , the 1.05 flash program just resets instead of showing the write fail message ( at the same point ) .	St
1.1.14	My next thought is to see if I can run a Windows PE ( Preinstall environment ) and use the ACER windows flash update program ( ZHG105W.exe ) .	St
1.1.15	Currently I have Ubuntu linux installed , thinking I might be able to update the bios from Ubuntu , but I cant find any appropriate file .	St
1.1.16	Do you think I am on the right track with the BIOS ?	Ques
1.1.17	Any help would be appreciated , and no , she is not going to be happy with Windows 8 ( I cant get back to windows 8 anyhow ) Thanks all , Les	St
1.2.1	A quick look does not show me that the BIOS supports that IDE MODE you need .	St
1.2.2	This means not only must you find all the drivers but you 'll need a floppy drive to perform the following .	St
1.2.3	USE GOOGLE and type this in .	St
1.2.4	- & gt ; XP F6 FLOPPY SATA INSTALL .	St
1.2.5	I find most folk are not ready for such an install .	St
1.2.6	- & gt ; If you go back to Windows 8 , why not add a start button so they are not as lost ?	Ques
1.2.7	They are free now .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have tried loading several different AMD SATA drivers using a floppy drive .	St
1.3.2	I still get the 7B stop .	St
1.3.3	I tried both the AMD SB7xx RAID Driver and the AMD SB8xx RAID Driver .	St
1.3.4	Any ideas which SATA driver I should be trying ?	Ques
1.4.1	The laptop maker must tell you which one .	St
1.4.2	I do not have this model to look further into .	St
1.4.3	I forget something above .	St
1.4.4	Sorry .	St
1.4.5	You will never get & quot ; XP & quot ; installed on such gear .	St
1.4.6	Those SATA drivers require & quot ; XP SP2 & quot ; or later CDs .	St
1.4.7	If you have XP and I have to take your word above that 's all you have then it 's a dead end .	St
1.4.8	Do n't waste your time .	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	I Have 3 CD 's , XP , SP2 and SP3 .	St
1.5.2	The SP2 and SP3 cds were created by slip streaming the service packs into the previous versions .	St
1.5.3	Acer of course says the XP is not supported , but they have said the same thing about the Intel Atom netbooks I have converted .	St
1.6.1	I just replaced Vista on an HP laptop a few months back .	St
1.6.2	I had to use the SP2 disc , and the XP and SP3 discs would not install .	St
1.6.3	I of course always try SP3 first , as that way I do n't need to install each service pack .	St
1.7.1	There are base code issues with XP and XP SP1 .	St
1.7.2	Get the real XP SP2 or XP SP3 to avoid that issue .	St
1.7.3	Good try , but after watching a tech waste days on that we know not to let them try it anymore .	Sug
1.7.4	Too costly .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	If you regress from Win8 , you MUST be assured that any & quot ; secure boot & quot ; process has been disabled .	St
1.8.2	Newer PCs , no matter what are becoming locked-in due to Bios/EUFI issue which in turn can use the secure boot mode .	St
1.8.3	It may become an issue if you ca n't boot from anything other than the original HD , etc .	St
1.8.4	Booting from other devices are defeated thus secured from malware attacks , even though not being done .	St
1.8.5	Overall , you need to verify the secure boot is disabled .	St
1.8.6	Win8 is becoming a PITA to change from .	St
1.8.7	Not only that but also all the other issues of drivers can they be found for lesser OSes ?	Ques
1.8.8	Google for secure boot to find examples of the problem .	St
1.8.9	This may not apply , but worth looking into .	St
1.8.10	http : //support.acer.com/acerpanam/netbook/2012/Acer/Aspire/AspireOneAO725/AspireOneAO725sp2.shtml http : //support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx ? modelId=4253 When , I visited Acer , there was n't much to garner from .	St
1.8.11	Overall , it lacked much , IMO .	St
1.8.12	Your best bet is to Win7 as the OS , rather than XP .	St
1.8.13	I do n't see much support for XP in any form .	St
1.8.14	Plus , as I already stated there may not be XP based drivers .	St
1.8.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.9.1	That 's a documented issue on some models .	St
1.9.2	No mystery but rarely encountered .	St
1.10.1	UEFI EFI Thanks for adding that Willy !	St
1.11.1	Thanks for this information .	St
1.11.2	I just ordered a SP3 CD .	St
1.11.3	Les	St
1.12.1	Thanks for the explanation of UEFI .	St
1.12.2	I had disabled that in the BIOS .	St
1.12.3	I did n't know what it was , but many other things could not be changed while UEFI was enabled .	St
1.13.1	I think there are a few mentioned by others such as CLASSIC8 START8 Bob	St
