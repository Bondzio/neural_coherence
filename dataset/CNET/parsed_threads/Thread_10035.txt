<s> I have an office in my detached garage. </s>
<s> My office computer has a broadband internet connection wired from an antenna on the roof that picks up a wireless signal broadcast from a few blocks down the road. </s>
<s> I would like to set up a wireless network inside my house to take advantage of this connection and the printer in the office with my laptop. </s>
<s> What is the best way to set this up? </s>
<s> The distance from the office computer to the laptop area in the house is about 125 feet with two exterior walls and several interior walls between. </s>
<s> Both machines are Dells( Inspiron and Demension Series) operating with Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> from your information, you connect the antenna directly to the computer.. </s>
<s> I don't know about such connection. </s>
<s> Please tell us what you have now, beside the computer and the antenna. </s>
