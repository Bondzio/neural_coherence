I replaced the card with a Netgear FA 311 PCI adapter when the original decided it had worked long enough. However, I can't get the computer to recognize the new card. I have tried uninstalling and disabling the old card but I get a &quot;Code 10&quot; error message - whatever that means. Do I need to get into the bios to change stuff and if so how do I do that? I have Windows XP but I don't know the model number of the computer; it's not anywhere on the case. HP support told me to contact Netgear and Netgear doesn't seem to know what I'm talking about. I appreciate your help; the kids are driving me nuts with only one computer connected to the Web. (Talk about spoiled! When I was a kid computers were made out of rocks and you had to use your feet to stop the car.) Thanks.

A clue is this user's review: &quot;Easier install driver than the Netgear 311 but..., Netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 (they send me the 311 driver disk). I figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption. After wasting sometime with the wrong driver I got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there. It works very well.. I just wish Netgear was a little more careful&quot; They had some 311's too and noted difficulty with the driver install. In closing, I think something fishy is going on here and I'd just get another card. Why? Look over http://kbserver.netgear.com/support_dnld.asp?prodNum=FA311 and if you download documentation and files, the latest date I see is 2001. This is years before Windows XP, so it may be just a bum card? Try another make/model. Or at least another slot... Bob Bob

Try pressing the Delete or ctrl or f10 key during the power-on, but before windows starts to load, that should get you into the bios. Good Luck Ciao.
