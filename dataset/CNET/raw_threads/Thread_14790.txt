I know I can just go out and buy any earphone for under 100$ and just crank up the volume until my brain is deteriorated by the bass vibrations and I start to drool all over myself, but I consider myself to have a pretty good ear and would like to keep it that way. So now my question is, are there earphone out there (preferably in-ear but not restricted to) that can completely block out outside noise, like people not understanding that a 3 to 4 feet of air in between two people does not block sound and yell at the top of their lungs? or if not what is the best noise cancellation (active or passive) earphone out there somebody can get, I know they can get pretty expensive but right now that's not the main issue. I just want to be able to concentrate on what I'm doing and not hear people yell about whether they prefer tampons or pads and not damage my ear drumbs

I've wondered about this myself: if I want 'noise-cancelling' head/earphones, I want the really annoying noise cancelled, which is as often as not the very transient phenomena that 'cancellation' handles poorly: apple/carrot snackers, far-ters, toe-tappers, finger drummers, drivel-talkers, knuckle-crackers, too-loud earphone brain-damaged music listeners. I remember one reviewer saying some headphones worked great on a plane to cancel internal jet-noise, but there was a mysterious clicking/popping sound in the phones; the passenger next to him was bopping along to some earphone music with mouth-click/pop accompaniment. I gathered the plane noise would have been preferable masking of this idiocy than the useless 'cancellation': the most annoying noise was coming through front and center.
