1.2.1	http : //www.amazon.com/Cyber-Acoustics-Subwoofer-Satellite-CA-3602/dp/B0027VT6V4 I see you are looking at wireless but something still gets wired to the laptop .	St

1.3.1	I have the Harmon Kardon soundsticks and I find the sound really good , but , as you can see from the photos , the subwoofer has a blue light glowing when it 's powered .	St
1.3.2	If it 's for your bedroom , one of the others would be better if they do n't have lights on them ( if you leave them powered all the time and if glowing lights will bother your sleep ) .	Sug
1.3.3	That 's the only drawback to them , otherwise I 'd recommend them .	St
