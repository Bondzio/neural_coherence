imo, it was terrific...especially the small text.
it had so many adjustments to perfect the image and the crt was rock stable.
and speaking of rock...it was as heavy as boulder.
i gave mine up recently for an lcd though my vs was still working ok...sort of.
it was fading and the picture shrinking slowly.
as well, it's weight was slowly warping my tabletop which is a full inch thick.
my best advice is to get rid of it or live with it as is.
i could suggest removing the housing, cleaning out the dust and spiders and reseating all the connections you can find but such can lead to shocking experiences if you don't know how to bleed the high voltage from the envelope and what to stay clear of.
i'm happy with my lcd but the old vs is now my standard in monitor performance.
