we never repair the file system or os on that hard disk.
-&gt; never!
we pull that hard disk out and set it aside.
a new blank drive is put in and we install the os, drivers and get the machine working.
if your cd dose not boot we fix that too (new cd, new cd drive, whatever it takes.)
now that we have a working machine we add the old drive on the slave or other connections and get our files back.
