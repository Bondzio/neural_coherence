hello, and thanks for all replies since my psu is rather new and of a renowned brand (enermax) i suppose it is a good one?
i don't know about wave forms tough.......... what can be done in that regards?
about the &quot;handover&quot;, both of my ups units are of the type that switches to battery when the ac power goes, you can hear the relays clicking when that happens.
and all of the outlets (there are only four of them) are battery covered, yes.
i describe the problem a bit more exact: if the ac power goes out (failure, or i switch the breaker) while the computer is on, the ups along with all connected devices shuts off - it bvriefly beeps and clicks, and then dies as if the battery was empty.
it will then refuse to start again, exactly as if the battery was flat - when i turn the ups switch off and on again.
however when i unplug the computer (only the machine, not monitor, printer or anything else that's on the ups) i can switch the ups back on!
and once it's on i can even connect the pc again, it will stay on (this is while ac power is still off).
i can then proceed to start the pc, boot normally and keep it going for quite some time before the battery really goes flat.
if there are other devices connected to the ups, such as a tv, a stereo or even a rather power-hungry small washing machine, these devices will stay on (along with the ups) when ac goes off.
so it's definitely only the actual pc that's causing this ups shutdown.
and i have two different ups's which show exactly the same behaviour, despite being of different brands and different power ratings.
the issue with the &quot;wave form&quot; sounds logical to me, but what can i do about it?
shield the wires somehow?
add grounding?
(my apartment has no grounding, as most electrical outlets in bangkok are fed by only two wires).
i appreciate any help i can get kind regards..... your thanh
