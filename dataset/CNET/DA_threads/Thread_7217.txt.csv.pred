1.1.1	I 'm looking for help on deciding what would be best .	St
1.1.2	I 'm looking to purchase an inexpensive tablet for my mother-in-law .	St
1.1.3	Does NOT need to be anything special ... I do own an IPAD 2 and it certainly does n't need to be anything of that quality .	St
1.1.4	Really , she just wants to be able to read books on it ( like an e-reader ) and surf the web a little .	St
1.1.5	Does n't need to have the best app selection or availability in the world , but if one has better access than the other , then great .	Ques
1.1.6	I 'm looking for something around the $ 250 mark .	St
1.1.7	In order of importance for what she would need : 1 ) needs to be the larger 10 & quot ; screen size 2 ) read books 3 ) web surfing - does n't need to be blazing fast ... just adequate .	St
1.1.8	Although , if it would display web pages in their & quot ; true form & quot ; that is cerainly a plus compared to something that will only display them in their & quot ; mobile & quot ; format 4 ) general email Really , I 'm looking at the following .	St
1.1.9	But if there is something better , by all means please suggest .	St
1.1.10	If not , can you recommend from this list based on my needs ?	Ques
1.1.11	1 ) Viewsonic gTablet 10.1 - can get around $ 250 right now 2 ) ARCHOS 101 Internet Tablet - can get around $ 230 right now 3 ) HP Touchpad - i know of the firsesale , but because of it you can still get them right now for around $ 250 so i 'm throwing it into the mix Thank you for your help ! !	St
1.1.12	!	St
1.2.1	I 'll give a link .	St
1.2.2	I have the Viewsonic .	St
1.2.3	A good bargain but the display , while good has a pretty narrow viewing angle .	St
1.2.4	And read http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-19686_102-539880.html ? tag=contentBody ; threadListing where they were looking at cheap and found the HP .	St

1.3.1	So basically , it sounds like my mother-in-laws main & quot ; needs & quot ; for it are very very similar to the gentleman 's in the other post you provided the link for .	St
1.3.2	In the end , he ended up finding a good deal on the HP Touchpad for $ 199 and seems very happy with his purchase , and confirmed it does everything he wanted very well .	St
1.3.3	Is it safe to say then , that with these specific & quot ; needs & quot ; considered , that forgetting about price since they 're all similar , that the HP Touchpad is hands down a better quality product ?	Ques
1.3.4	If so , I can wait and try to catch the deal when they put their last release out , or at very worst , pay basically the same $ 250 as these other options today and get a better product ?	Ques
1.3.5	Even if I wait , and miss out on the next firesale , i would have to think that all of these other online retailers are still going to be in the $ 250 range for the HP Touchpad .	St
1.3.6	Some of the ones being discussed in the other thread ( Nook color , etc ) were the 7 & quot ; tablets , and I would really need it to be the 10 & quot ; so I ruled them out immediately .	St
1.4.1	But the short version is that folk & quot ; snapped up & quot ; the 99 buck HP on the firesale .	St
1.4.2	It does the basics of web browsing and reading ( PDF ? )	Ques
1.4.3	well enough .	St
1.4.4	It proves that folk will dive in at the 99 and 199 price .	St
1.4.5	-- & gt ; My prediction ?	Ques
1.4.6	If you wait for it , the new Kindle might be in that price range since it will be subsidized by Kindle/Amazon book and app sales .	St
1.4.7	Yes , that 's not here and now but worth noting .	St
1.4.8	I have the Nook Color and find it very useful .	St
1.4.9	I would look at that again .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
