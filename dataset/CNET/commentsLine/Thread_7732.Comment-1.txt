okay, so my very basic questions are, is it possible to connect to a modem through usb, why?
and why isn't it possible for me to connect to my modem directly from various computers i.e., how come changing ethernet cable to another computer wont allow internet connection(configuration problem?)
last ques: should wired router from modem to desktop and laptop work and what if any configuration is necessary?
