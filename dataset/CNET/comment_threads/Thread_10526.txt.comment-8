I run into powerline hardly ever.
So as time passes I just remember the workarounds and don't see why I should call them on such when I got it working just by a simple change.
No other change and we could repeat the move, break it and put it back on the other circuit and it would work.
Since it works and that cured the few systems that I saw I have to share what happened and move on.
