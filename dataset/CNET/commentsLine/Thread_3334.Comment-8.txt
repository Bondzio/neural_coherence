that's what i was concerned with.
the hamachi vpn sounds promising; this may be a path forward.
the network admin with my company did not recommend anything of this nature.
about 2-months ago i proposed securing our data, he has not offered any suggestions, other than using the supplied cellular air cards?
however these cards do not work in all areas, thus this posting.
will the connection to my home computer using the hamachi vpn be visible to the server?
this would be disastrous.
i am definitely in the right forum, i can tell the posters are experienced, very well.
