<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4600 P4 3Ghz 1Gb Ram and i'm looking to upgrade my graphics card to a 6800Gt i have been told i need a new psu existing (250) if this is the case is it just a matter of fitting a new psu or does it have a bigger impact then that i.e will upgrading the psu effect other components of my hardware Thanks in advance </s>
<s> your model doesn't have the proprietary power supply that some had. </s>
<s> You couldn't just buy another one off the shelf and install it with certain Dells....you had to use one of theirs instead, if I recall correctly. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> for the Nvidia GeForce 6600GT either in PCIe or AGP versions and you will see it needs more than a 250W power supply. </s>
<s> Also in AGP versions of the 6600GT they normally furnish a cable to connect additional power to the power supply. </s>
<s> I just bought and installed a new 420W power supply in my PC with thoughts of a 6600GT AGP card pretty soon. </s>
<s> Don't have a Dell, but Toni H. is right on....some Dell's especially the old ones need special Power Supply and also special fitting, and some don't. </s>
<s> ...has sturdy Dell replacements, www.pcpowerandcooling.com </s>
<s> More demanding video output are stating at least on thier packaging, &quot;to have 350W p/s&quot;. </s>
<s> Having a larger p/s isn't going to hurt the system provided its &quot;doable&quot; as some systems either have propiertory cabling or rewired voltage output, great for thier systems but not &quot;generic&quot; to what typically available. </s>
<s> Thus, you need be sure its not only rated to fit and compatible but also be at least 350W or better. </s>
<s> Dell, may have an upgrade path from thier wares or not but check. </s>
<s> A good vendor to check with is http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com or google for any other vendor. </s>
