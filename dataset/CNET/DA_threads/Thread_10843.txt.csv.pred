1.1.1	Hi , I have a Dell Dimension 4700 that has all stock parts and Windows Xp Home Edition 32Bit .	St
1.1.2	It is a mid tower case and I am looking to upgrade it as I want to play newer games without getting another computer .	St
1.1.3	I was wondering if someone could help me pick out certain parts for it that are both compatible with it and will fit in my case .	St
1.1.4	I am looking to upgrade the Power supply to at least 500 watts , get a new motherboard that supports intel core 2 duo , 4 expansion slots for memory and can support pci express x16 and 2.0 .	St
1.1.5	Also I want to get a good cpu that can either be overclocked or that is good for gaming ( Crysis ) .	St
1.1.6	I know im asking for a lot but i am new to the whole upgrading thing .	St
1.2.1	The operating system from Dell could be locked to the old board so budget for a new OS as well .	St
1.2.2	The video card list I use is at http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-cards,1942.html Bob	St
1.3.1	Basically , you 're upgrading everything but the case , so really what are you saving to re-use ?	Ques
1.3.2	Effectively , just get a DIY setup and proceed .	St
1.3.3	If you plan to keep the OEM XP-OS , most just wo n't work outside of they 're original system .	St
1.3.4	So , look at eMachine or similar for details of basic newer system and go from there .	St
1.3.5	Gamer websites should provide what really works for any particular games .	St
1.3.6	Basic & quot ; bare bones & quot ; system that have a mtrbd , cpu and some ram but nothing else are also out there , check online vendors like Geeks , NewEgg and TigerDirect for such , but there are lots out there .	St
1.3.7	Take my advice do n't skimp on a decent psu , besides wattage and cooling for same .	St
1.3.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
