i am the friend that wrote the post for him.
thanks for the advice i found the correct v3 user manual to help him set up a dmz and disable dhcp.
there are problems with upnp with ps3 devices using netgear hardware.
resetting the router to factory settings is probably a bit drastic, as he is not too familiar with router configuration and is not confident with a guide alone.
wireless configuration can be fun and games at the best of times.
however im sure he will upgrade th  firmware before making any changes.
