24 hours later I had tried charging it and the whole time the nook charge light just glowed green, even thou it should have been orange first, so I tried one last time to restart it,,, pressed the on tab for about 15 seconds instead of usual 4 or 5. it came on,, best I can figure,, I had been activating apps from Nook , and I get the feeling they want you to do them one at a time,, they say the tablet will pick up the app in about a half hour,,, I had tried to get about 3 in that time, so Im thinking that might have been too much info coming to the tablet , so for now its been working great all day, and I dont have to toss $120, in the trash.
