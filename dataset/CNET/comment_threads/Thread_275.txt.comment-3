I know it's a ECS G33T-M2 Intel G33 Express Motherboard and just a generic PCI IDE Card.
I've tested in an old PC so i know it works.
It's Vista I'm trying to install.
The problem being that nothing is on the hard drives so it just flashes to the no OS found screen instantly on startup because the CDROMs hooked into the PCI IDE card don't show.
I may have to break down and order from the link you provided (thank you for that) and wait it out through shipping.
