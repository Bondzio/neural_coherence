this is exactly how i fixed my problem: uninstall the driver for wpc54g (from the device manager).
download the latest driver from linksys.com, it will be in a &quot;zipped&quot; (compressed) folder.
after extracting the uncompressed folder, just run the &quot;setup.exe&quot; file.
if you have other versions of the linksys wireless utility software, it will instruct you to remove that program first.
if this does not fix your problem, then you can try windows repair problem.
the problem with windows is that it sometimes installs a bad driver, if you allow it.
