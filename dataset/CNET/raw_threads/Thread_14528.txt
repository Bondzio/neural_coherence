If it didn't come with the utiliity, download it from the HD maker's website. What is the manufacturer and model number of the HD?

I d/l the utility and performed the operation successfully. I also have another drive that I removed so I could install the new drive and information that I want to transfer as well or is it just easier to install original software?

The master or slave is determined by which connector you plug it into. The drive maker (most) supplies the software and instructions to move to the new drive. I'd follow that since it's free and easy. Bob

MS office does not work and every time I attempt to reinstall, i get an error message. I attempt the detect and repair selection but the installer package says &quot; package could not be verified&quot; and verify if the package exists and to contact the vendor. The cd rom starts up that is the end of it. I am afraid to uninstall and not able to reinstall since I am dependant on it.
