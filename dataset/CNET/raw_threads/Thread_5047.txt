15015	0	161721	1793035	NR	Quimbly	3/7/06 8:48 AM	1.14172128E12	Help needed configuring wireless network	I'm having lots of grief in configuring my wireless network. Last week, before I moved, everything was working fine. I had cable internet, my desktop PC was connected directly to my wireless router, and my laptop used wireless to connect to the network. On the weekend I moved, changed ISPs, added a VoIP terminal, and am now trying to configure both my PC and laptop with wireless cards. Here's my layout: cable -&gt; cable modem -&gt; voip terminal -&gt; wireless router After experimenting a long while last night, I was able to get either my laptop OR my desktop connected, but not both! Both PCs are running Win XP SP2. Here's what I know for sure: - The Internet connection itself is working. I can connect to wherever at one of the computers. - The restriction doesn't have to do with the ACL on the wireless router (as I've disabled it and still have the problem) - The problem doesn't appear to be security related, as I can remove all security on the router and still have the same problem - I reserved two IPs on the router, one for the desktop, one for the laptop, and configured their wireless cards to use these IPs. This doesn't seem to be the problem, but I could be wrong. - The PC that can't connect is getting DNS information, but not much else. If I ping google.com, it resolves to an IP, but I never get a response. Also, from this PC I can't ping other PCs on the network or the router. - Both PCs ARE connecting to the wireless network, but one of them can't connect to the Internet or to anything else on the network. Does anyone have any thoughts on what might be wrong, or what else I could do to diagnose and fix the problem?

(ie. vmware, vpn, etc.) 3. have you tried using dhcp as opposed to static mapping? in my mixed wireless/wired home network, i do utilize dhcp and static mapping with no issues, but i've seen some funny things happen when i tried static mapping with some home NAT devices -- most likely because of misconfiguration. 4. are you able to ping your NAT/router from your problem PC? 5. how did you configure DNS server entries on your computers? are you letting your NAT/router be the gateway to your ISP's DNS servers? if you are NOT able to ping even the NAT/router but you are able to get DNS resolutions then --- errrrr --- i have to think about that... but that'll be a nice bit of info to know. i don't ever check these forums, the only reason why i came across this post, is because this post somehow showed up as &quot;news&quot; on my google desktop... so ehrm... good luck! cm

There is a VPN adapter on the laptop, but that shouldn't matter. 3. Yes, I have tried using DHCP. Same result. 4. Yes, I am able to ping my wireless router from both PCs, but I can't ping the voice terminal from either. 5. DNS configuration is the same on both PCs, set to the ip for the wireless router.
15015	9	161721	1794797	1793992	Gakada	3/8/06 1:40 AM	1.141782E12	It seems that you don't use DHCP	from your list, all of them have dhcp DISABLED... why don't you try to enabled it .. in your router too.. UNLESS you also disable the DHCP on the ROUTER... then you need to make all the IP in the same IP range address. You may also try to bridge the Wireless and Local internet connection ... (right click the network icon on the taskbar, open network connection, -- select wireless network connection and Local internet connection (using Ctrl key to select two items or more), right click and select Bridge connections.. Note: If this doesn't work .. then remove from bridge again.
