<s> I am using Dell Dimension 3000 computer with Dell E173 FP Flat Panel Color monitor less that two years. </s>
<s> Yesterday, when I turned on the computer, I have seen only black screen. </s>
<s> The power LED was green. </s>
<s> When I turned OFF and then ON the power of the monitor, the screen was normal several seconds (I saw icons on the screen) and then became black again. </s>
<s> I ran self-test pattern and I think that the monitor does not pass it, because the self-test pattern does not scroll through the screen continually. </s>
<s> It appeared in the left bottom corner of the screen and then in a second disappeared. </s>
<s> Please let me know where is the problem? </s>
<s> How to solve it/ Now instead of computer monitor I am using TV screen. </s>
<s> Hence, the problem is only with monitor. </s>
<s> How to solve it? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for help. </s>
<s> Check the warranty but on LCD flat screens there is little an owner can fix. </s>
<s> Other test? </s>
<s> Try the screen on another PC. </s>

<s> Thanks for response. </s>
<s> I do not have the warranty. </s>
<s> Do you think that I can fix the monitor myself? </s>
<s> How to do it? </s>
<s> I tried already the screen on another PC. </s>
<s> The screen remains black. </s>
<s> Unless you get lucky and it's something like we see discussed at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=62739&messageID=744233 What electronics background do you have? </s>
<s> For example I have not only a volt meter but the usual oscilloscope and other electronic repair items in my little home lab. </s>
<s> If the warranty can't be extended what stops you from opening it up and looking for bad solder joints or burnt spots? </s>

<s> Dear Bob: Thank you very much for your response. </s>
<s> You wrote, If the warranty can't be extended what stops you from opening YOU ARE SECOND TIME PAID MY ATTENTION TO THE WARRANTY OF THE MONITOR. </s>
<s> The warranty of my computer system was 90 days, and I thought the monitor has the same warranty time period. </s>
<s> After your second e-mail I started to read carefully the Product Information Guide and have learned that my monitor has a 3-year limited warranty. </s>
<s> I called Dell and they replaced the monitor with the refurbished one. </s>
<s> It works very well. </s>
<s> Best regards, Peter </s>
<s> Thanks for posting that it all worked out. </s>
