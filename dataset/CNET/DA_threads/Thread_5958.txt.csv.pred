1.1.1	I think that the satas are the fastest.... but wich model?	St
1.1.2	and I have an NVIDIA nforce Network adapter, can I get one that makes my internet faster?	St
1.2.1	you already have a 500gb sata 7200rpm drive so it's a fast hard drive.	St
1.2.2	a 10,000rpm drive is technically faster but won't help most apps.	St
1.2.3	if you're creating multi-gigabyte video files, a 10k drive may help a bit, but otherwise you won't notice the overall difference.	St
1.2.4	run the speed test and tweak test at http://www.dslreports.com/tools to make sure you're getting the broadband speed you're paying for and to tune your connection.	St
1.3.1	Is 10,000 the highest It can go?	St
