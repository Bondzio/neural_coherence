Proffitt	8/16/09 3:46 AM	1.25039436E12	finally found watts	look subwebaddr thats card stripped system running real measured watts thing remember our test system bare minimum rpm sataii single hard drive without cd rom many cooling fans reserve commenting till got memory timing way point id consider beefing psu considering using board drivers gt today zero cost try drivers test subwebaddr drivers forceware catalyst lets something nasty table running torrents such bets off bob
