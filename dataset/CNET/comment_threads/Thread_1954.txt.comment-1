I have a Packard Bell computer that is running on Windows 98 and has Lite-On CD-ROM LTN301, 64 MB RAM, IDE HDD, NEC Floppy.
It was given to me as a gift because the former owner just bought a much newer PC.
I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the CD-ROM drive.
Everything works fine except for this drive.
Whenever I put any type of disc into the drive it will not run automatically, so I go into My Computer and double click the D: drive.
It will not load this way either.
It just displays the error message: &quot;D: Not Accessible; Device is not ready.&quot; Does anyone know how to fix this.
Is it software or hardware related etc.?
Thanks in advance for any replies.
