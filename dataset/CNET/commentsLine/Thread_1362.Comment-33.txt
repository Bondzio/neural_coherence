hi, i have an acer aspire 5028wlmi laptop and just recently been shutting itself off without warning and so i thought this might have something to do with the cpu overheating, i donwloaded a programme to test the temp and my laptop is normaly in the range of 55 degrees c and 90 degrees c. i dont think this is normal but i want to be sure.
appreciate any guidance
