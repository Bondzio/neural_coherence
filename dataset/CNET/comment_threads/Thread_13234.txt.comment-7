I bit the bullet, went to Radio Shack and got Arctic Silver 5 compound, cleaned off the heat sink and processors with a credit card and alcohol as suggested on their site, screwed everything down, kept the door open with a fan pointed right at the heat sink, turned on and prayed.
With the door open and fan on, I am maintaining a 50.5-51.4C temp.
When I close up and let the original (and annoyingly erratic) fan do the work, it maintains between 59.5 to 60.5C.
This suggests I need a better fan, but I guess the old paste was just preventing any heat from conducting through to the sink.
Thanks for building up my confidence to actually &quot;touch&quot; the processor.
Hopefully I am not too fearless now and avoid cracking open my laptop
