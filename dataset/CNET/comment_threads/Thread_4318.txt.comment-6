When I run into this is mostly many year old machines.
Specifically those old workhouses based on LX, BX and some i8xx chipsets.
These chipsets had only some many memory select lines and quite often where you would have to dance around to find just the right memory sticks.
These are also fairly robust machines that rarely died which explains why you run into them so often.
PNY, and those store memory sticks are usually double sided and the usual 256 MB sticks are the ones that rarely work.
Why this is so is that the sticks are made purely for lowest price and what would work in the most systems.
I know it's a little tough at first, but keep trying... Bob
