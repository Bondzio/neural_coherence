i remember using the commodore 64 back in the early 80's...flaunted as the computer for everyone, but who would ever use or need more than 64k of memory?!?
...but then again, there was the trs-80 (trash-80) from radio shack back in the late 70's, that had everyone brain-scratching on learning basic... mid 80's, i got my hands on this behomoth known as the xerox 860 ips which was called an information processing system (read: word processor for the elite), with dual 8&quot; drives and ethernet cabling which rivaled telephone cables in density.
with a little know-how, this word processor was a 2-ton micro-computer!
(almost a main-frame, but hey!
who needs to consolidate information?
that is what the pool of secretaries were for, right?
/duck (btw - that little beastie was built solid like a tank and didn't even sustain any damage when a klh speaker fell on it from 10' above the floor, during the loma prieta earthquake, oct 17, '89...then again, neither did the klh speaker!...talk about quality.
those were the days....) late 80's, i got my mac classic while i was learning dtp, word processing, micro-computers and hypertalk.
have to respect oop (object oriented programming) in terms of time and keying savers.
easy really is hard!
early to mid 90's, i had (still have) my quadra 660 av, powerpc 880 av and powerbook 100 - they all still work, and are still excellent for dtp (but it is sad/cool when i have thumb drives with 100x the size of my hdd's in these rigs!
), but when apple abandoned those of us who invested in the new technology, those of us who were techno savy/hungry, went looking for bigger and better things... jump forward to mid 90's through current and i was/am using technology from the 70's as a (former) 39b - electronic quality assurance test equipment (equate) and later (currently) as a 94k - electronic equipment test facility (eetf) operator/maintainer/instructor with mini, micro, and main-frame technologies.
in 2001, i got converted from a mac-head, to a pc-freak and got addicted to the mmorpg-scene where cutting-edge components are the key to survival.
i have stuck with amd since then, with 6 custom-built rigs from socket-a's to my current dedicated 939 gaming rig: tt armor va8000swa silver aluminum atx full tower, a8n-sli deluxe mobo, amd athlon 64 x2 4400+(89w) toledo 2.2ghz, pc power & cooling 750w ps, wd raptor 150gb x2 (raid-0), bfg 8800gts 640mb x2 sli, g.skill 2gb (2 x 1gb) sdram ddr 400, creative 7.1 channels sound blaster x-fi xtremegamer fatal1ty pro, xp pro sp2, logitech g15 kb, and razer copperhead mouse.
so all in all, i guess i got in just after fortran, kobol, and the rooms full of punch-cards were reduced to little used antiquities.
