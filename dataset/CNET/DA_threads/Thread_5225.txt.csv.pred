1.1.1	Condition ( s ) : 1 LAN/Network ( 5 pc 's ) with Cable internet connection , using Cable modem and a router ( DHCP enabled , with router IP : 192.168.1.1 ) 1 LAN/Network ( 7 pc 's ) with ADSL internet connection , using ADSL modem and a router ( DHCP enabled , with router IP : 192.168.2.1 ) Note : Both LAN/Network located in the & quot ; same & quot ; building/house .	St
1.1.2	Problems or Goal : to make both LAN/Network can share Data/files .	St
1.1.3	Question : How to setup the connection of both LAN/Network together , so it can share data/files ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thank you for any help .	St
1.2.1	The simplist solution is to just drop DHCP and hardcode the IP address all around .	St
1.2.2	Use the same IP , Gateway , DNS entries and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 and it will work fine with internet traffic still going to each respective DSL and Cable box .	St
1.2.3	If this is n't a solution for you , then you will have loads of fun with net route commands and another ( real ) router .	St
1.2.4	But I wo n't be doing that because it 's too much for this small space .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The word & quot ; same & quot ; ( IP , Gateway , DNS entries and NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 ) , confused me a little .	St
1.3.2	Currently both LAN/Network are separated physically .	St
1.3.3	Can I just plug in both modem ( Cable and ADSL ) in one Switch ( Cable + ADSL Modem - & gt ; Switch -- & gt ; PC 's ) and make the IP , Gateway , DNS entries and NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 , configuration as you suggested ?	Ques
1.3.4	If I understand it correctly then : For the Cable modem I set the IP : 192.168.1.1 For the ADSL modem I set the IP : 192.168.1.2 Disable DHCP Set DNS ( as per ISP ( cable/ADSL requirement ? )	Ques
1.3.5	Set Gateway ( 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 ) Set Netmask ( 255.255.0.0 on both modem ? )	Ques
1.3.6	For the PC 's , I configure each PC 's accordingly .	St
1.3.7	Does it matter if they use different workgroup name ?	Ques
1.3.8	Please advice , Thank You	Ques
1.4.1	It should be : Cable modem -- & gt ; Router -- & gt ; Switch ADSL Modem/Router -- & gt ; Switch ( same Switch ) , then from the switch to the PC 's .	St
1.5.1	No changes were needed on the modems .	St
1.5.2	The cable/dsl routers might need one tweak .	St
1.5.3	Turn off DHCP .	St
1.5.4	Then you SET all the IP , DNS , GATEWAY on each client , but all the systems use the NETMASK value of 255.255.0.0 Done .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	After more coffee , it occurred to me that only 1/2 or less of the CLIENT machines and just ONE dsl/cable needs work .	St
1.6.2	1 .	St
1.6.3	Select which router has the most users or which one you want to set to DHCP .	St
1.6.4	2 .	St
1.6.5	Disable DHCP in the router that you will not want DHCP .	St
1.6.6	3 .	St
1.6.7	Alter the router that remains a DHCP server to hand out the NETMASK 255.255.0.0 4. on the Lan with no DHCP , change all the CLIENTS to Static IP addressing using what they got as a template and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 5 .	St
1.6.8	Connect the two LANs .	St
1.6.9	Bob	St
1.7.1	Both modem/router have a default IP 192.168.1.1 is this default only valid with DHCP enabled ?	Ques
1.7.2	if both have that same IP.. and connected to the same switch , are n't they conflicting ?	Ques
1.7.3	Anyway I will try it on monday , before that , Please help with this details : Cable modem-router , DHCP enabled , with IP address 192.168.1.1 , netmask 255.255.0.0 no changes on the pc 's ADSL modem/router , DHCP disabled , with IP ?	Ques
1.7.4	? , netmask 255.255.0.0 On the PC 's , IP 192.168. ? .	Ques
1.7.5	? , Netmask 255.255.0.0 , Gateway ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.7.6	others ? ?	Ques
1.7.7	Thank You	St
1.8.1	In short , that was NOT in your first post .	St
1.8.2	So you would alter the NAT/Router of choice before you start so you can do this with some ease .	Sug
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Cable modem router , DHCP enabled , IP : 192.168.1.1 , netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc 's are Automatic IP.. ( with an IP range 192.168.1.100 - & gt ; 140 ) ADSL modem/router , DHCP disabled , IP : 192.168.1.2 , netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc 's IP : 192.168.1.2xx , gateway 192.168.1.2 , DNS : as ISP required .	St
1.9.2	It seems to works ... but did I do it correctly ?	Ques
1.9.3	Why you stressed out the netmask of 255.255.0.0 ?	Ques
1.9.4	Tried to use fix IP under 192.168.1.140.. on ADSL modem/router , but then I concern with conflicting IP when the PC 's are started.. ( thats the reason of IP above 200 ) Tried using different IP on each modem/router ( i.e Cable IP : 192.168.1.1 and ADSL IP : 192.168.2.1 ) , it did n't work for LAN ( file/data share ) If I could make it better or fix something , please advice..	St
1.9.5	Thank you	St
1.10.1	It can work , but I was concerned that the NAT/Routers may not know how to handle the packet bound for the other LAN .	St
1.10.2	Good to see it works .	St
1.10.3	& quot ; It seems to works ... but did I do it correctly ? & quot ; The file sharing and route to/from each LAN may fail .	St
1.10.4	If so , you change the netmask so that both LANs are in the same LAN .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	Thank you for your help , I guess I have to stay with the working configuration .	St
1.11.2	But then I have another question regarding the 'Fixed IP ' on a couple of Laptop involved in the LAN .	St
1.11.3	Those Laptop are configured to use the ADSL with fix IP address .	St
1.11.4	What should be done to make it 'mobile ' from one LAN/network environment to another ( i.e .	St
1.11.5	from the adsl modem lan/network to cable modem lan/network -- or from office to home LAN/network ) Thank you again for the help	St
1.12.1	& quot ; What should be done to make it 'mobile ' from one LAN/network environment to another ( i.e .	St
1.12.2	from the adsl modem lan/network to cable modem lan/network -- or from office to home LAN/network ) & quot ; I would use NETSWITCHER from http : //www.netswitcher.com At the price of good help , this one is cheap , works ... Bob	St
