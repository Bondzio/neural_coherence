was included in device instructions.
so many flash and external drives come formatted and with software on them but i'll tend to pull off anything i want to save and format the device myself.
years ago, 3.5&quot; floppy disks came un-formatted or, for a higher price, pre-formatted.
i can't tell you how many of those pre-formatted disks i found to give read/write or track 0 errors immediately.
i tended to always format these in the drive on the machine i would want to use them with.
it should not have mattered in an ideal world but seemed like a good idea.
what you might do when and if you get a replacement is to format it one of the devices that must write to or read from it and then test it with something that's expendable or already backed up.
good luck.
