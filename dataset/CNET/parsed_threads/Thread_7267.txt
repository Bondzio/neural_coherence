<s> Hi I have just installed a d-link dkt-710 router with dwa-111 wireless adapter on my winxp /pentium 4 machine. </s>
<s> The router installed fine and I can get internet via the LAN cable. </s>
<s> I then proceeded to install the drivers for the wireless adapter....it failed to install correctly. </s>
<s> Now when ever I try to install the drivers I get the error message &quot;The name is already in use as either a service name or a service display name&quot; The d-link tech guys gave me the following info - Thanks for contacting D-Link technical support,it looks like the problem &gt; is not with the DWA-111 since it has been tested on numerous occasions on &gt; different computers with different operating system,from the error &gt; message you are getting it looks like you need to delete a couple of files &gt; from the registry,please follow these steps carefully and your prolem &gt; should be solved. </s>
<s> &gt; First Remove any dlink software installed and restart your computer then &gt; try the following and that should solve The problem: &gt; &gt; Clearing upper and lower registry filters : &gt; &gt; 1. </s>
<s> Unplug all non-essential external plug and play devices, especially The &gt; Dlink Wireless USB Adapter. </s>
<s> &gt; 2. </s>
<s> Click Start , and Run enter &quot;regedit&quot; and Click OK &gt; The registry editor window appears. </s>
<s> &gt; &gt; 3.Select Computer in the main window. </s>
<s> &gt; &gt; 4. </s>
<s> Click File, Export, type a filename that is easy for you to remember, &gt; and click Save. </s>
<s> &gt; A copy of the registry has saved for back-up purposes to the Documents &gt; folder. </s>
<s> &gt; If problems occur after using these steps, browse to the file and &gt; double-click it to restore the registry. </s>
<s> &gt; &gt; 5. </s>
<s> Click the plus sign ( +) next to the following items in the list: &gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt; CurrentControlSet &gt; Control &gt; Class &gt; &gt; 6.Select 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318. </s>
<s> Make sure you have selected &gt; this exact key name. </s>

<s> Select LowerFilters value and press the Delete key and confirm the &gt; deletion by clicking Yes &gt; 8.If an UpperFilters value is also listed, select UpperFilters in the &gt; right window and press the Delete key. </s>
<s> &gt; Confirm the deletion by clicking Yes. </s>
<s> &gt; &gt; &gt; 9.Delete all other UpperFilter and LowerFilter values within the &gt; 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318 key if they exist. </s>
<s> &gt; 10.Close the registry editor and restart the computer. </s>

<s> The first time the lower key value was present and i removed it - but it hasnt appeared since. </s>
<s> - and the adapter will still not install. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me ? </s>
<s> - I have tried on numerous occasions to install the drivers so I am thinking maybe it has left values somewhere else in the registry ? </s>
<s> regards Steve </s>
<s> Recheck my work on installing the OS. </s>
<s> I might download and install the motherboard chipset drivers and try the network card again. </s>
<s> If that fails I return the product as defective and try something else. </s>
<s> Yes there are other causes but I'm not going to duplicate the answers at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22The+name+is+already+in+use+as+either+a+service+name+or+a+service+display+name%22&btnG=Google+Search since you would have done that already. </s>

<s> After trying to delete the reg key many times and it still not working I decided to do a system restore to the day before I first tried to install the drivers - BINGO it now works fine. </s>
<s> Only thing is the router is approx 10 ft away and the signal is up and down all the time. </s>
<s> There is only a stud wall in between the PC and router. </s>
<s> Bit disapointed with the performance so far..... thanks for your help bob. </s>
<s> Is the router firmware up to date? </s>
<s> Are you using the usual settings of: 1. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID 2. </s>
<s> WPA Bob </s>
