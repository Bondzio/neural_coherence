hello, i've just bought an external hdd for back up and large file storage.
it has two firewire plugs and one usb2.
i'm very happy with it's functioning over the usb connector.
my concern is, however, how can i protect this external data from access through connection to any other computer?
i do not want to, also for time reasons, encrypt every byte that is stored on it.
i have heard of little safety keys with some incorporated encryption on it, that has to be inserted in one of the plugs of the hdd.
searching on the net, i've not found what i was looking for, can somebody help?
thanks for your reply.
