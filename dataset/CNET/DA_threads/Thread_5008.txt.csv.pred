1.1.1	Hello, thank you in advance for checking this discussion out and trying to help me.	Polite
1.1.2	My question is, which of the following setting is better for gaming: 1)an AMD 3800+ dual core with 2gb DDR 400mhz and a 7800 gt oc =or= 2)an Intel 830 3.0Ghz dual core with 2gb DDR2 667mhz and a 7800 gt oc Thanks in advance Cheers P.S.	St
1.1.3	I know that intel has a faster clock speed, but since AMD has a different archeitecture, sometimes AMD ends up faster than intel, this is why i am asking this question even though Intel has a faster clock speed.	St
1.1.4	:P	St
1.2.1	I say setup 2 because because newer RAM is there.	St
1.2.2	DDR2 is better than DDR.	St
1.2.3	It has been proven that the 3800+ is better for gaming than the Intel 830, but since that Intel has DDR2, I'll go with #2.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	DDR isn't that much worse, plus due to benchmarks i'd go AMD all the way.	St
1.4.2	Go pick yourself up a nice AMD system.	Sug
1.4.3	I would.	St
1.4.4	Plus, DDR2 is limited by latency in any case.	St
1.4.5	I'd go for the better processor myself.	Sug
1.4.6	Processor = power, you can go ddr 2 later but atm nothing is gonna beat it.	St
1.5.1	if DDR2 has a faster mhz, how can it have a high latency (for example 5-5-5-10) while DDR has a lower mhz, but lower latency (for example 3-4-4-8), i know DDR has a lower latency, but how does it work?	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
