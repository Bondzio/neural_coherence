Whether the board and bios support a faster cpu, whether a faster cpu is even available for that board seeing as the one running on it is....well terribly outdated. It may be that a simple bios update could enable the board to handle a faster cpu, but then you'd have to find a cpu that's faster than the one you have that's compatible. I doubt very much if it'll support anything that's still sold on the market. I'm going to have a look at the NEC Z1 config and see of they have any info, I'll get back to you.

The manufacturer claims that processor is upgradeable but doesn't state to what speed. Honestly seeing as how it had 96 Mb of pc-100 ram installed stock and is only capable of supporting 256 Mb, I'm not entirely sure you'd want to invest the money on a processor that even though would be faster than the one you have, is still going to be terribly outdated. That's a decision only you can make. The processor is a Slot 1 pentium III Matai, they only go to 600 mhz. That kind of trouble, epsecially given the all in one design of the computer, for 150 mhz, is not even close to worth the time to me. If it would happen that the board supported coppermine cpu's you could go right up to 1.1 ghz, but I seriously doubt the board is calibrated to support the extra voltage the cpu would require.

Pentium III 450 mhz slot 1. make sure there are no other designations after slot 1. As I mentioned the coppermine pentium III's were slot one as well, but I'd have to do more reasearch into whether they're compatible, I seriously doubt it though. Bear in mind the original slot 1 PIII's only went to 600 mhz.

Small all-in-one foot print on the desk. I upgraded mine several years back when the 850 mhz PIII's came on the market. I doubt you can go much beyond that speed since the bios fails to report beyond 800. I think I also upgraded the firmware in it. The processor you need is a SLOT 1 Intel P3 850mhz. You need to buy the intel box set and what that means is the one with active cooling. It has the heat sink and fan already mounted on the processor card. You unplug the old processor and plug in the new one. You can also upgrade the ram to 512MB using 2-256MB SDRAMs. Hope that was helpful.

Cheers Man Hope to hear from yah!
