I'm building a system for photo editing and gaming, but I'm not a hardcore gamer. Thus I didn't feel the need to build at the cutting edge. Here is my current configuration: MSI K8N Neo4/SLI AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice CORSAIR ValueSelect 2x1GB Leadtek 6800GT Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 250GB BenQ DW1640 BK Fortron Blue Storm 500W Power Supply Lian-Li PC-7B Plus Black Does anyone know of any compatability issues? Improvements? Other considerations? Thanks, Jeff

That doesn't include a monitor or any other peripherals, just what was there. I'm buying most of it on ZipZoomFly. I'd prefer newegg, but I'm in Cali and the tax kills it. Plus ZZF is offering free shipping on all the pricey components. So looks like I'm going to order this stuff tonight.
