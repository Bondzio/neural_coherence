i made a mistake & downloaded sp 2 for my pc running xt, after i installed it however i started having stop errors as many as 10 times in one day!
pointing at everything in the pc!
dell eventually replaced the drive.
i ordered sp2 on cd from microsoft, but it took me several months to work up enough courage to try to install from the cd, d&#8144;id so finally & never had another problem.
