Sorry if I didn't make myself clear but I am looking into desktops but a top of the line high performing laptop too catches my eye.
Non gaming please!
I know that Toshiba has an extreme quad core notebooks and some australian company was going to come out with quad core laptops.
So really I am just looking into high end perf for desktops and laptops I guess I will have to wait till quad becomes standard issue with at last 160GB SDD.
