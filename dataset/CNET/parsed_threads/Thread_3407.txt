<s> I am looking to buy a new computer and I am wondering what are the best desktop vendors out there? </s>
<s> I currently own a computer from CyberPowerInc (3 years old) which has been a great computer overall but their customer service sucks. </s>
<s> Still, I have still been unable to beat their prices. </s>
<s> Keep in mind, I am not looking to buy a computer that includes Windows or a monitor (since some vendors make you purchase Windows). </s>
<s> I am looking in the $500-$600 range. </s>
<s> As a side question, is it worth it to get a AMD 64bit processor now? </s>
<s> Also, any recommendations on the best value brands for motherboards, harddrives, DVD burners, ect. </s>
<s> are welcome. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You can BUILD a nice machine for 600 bucks. </s>
<s> Check www.newegg.com Good AMD (non 64) board would be the shuttle AN35N Ultra Good AMD proc would be the mobile 2600+ (can easily overclock to 2.5Ghz, which is what mine is at now) Memory - Mushkin about 79 bucks for 512MB (get 2 to run in dual channel mode) Hard drive - any brand should do, get at least 80GB DVD burner - I always recommend Lite On, but newegg has an 8x optorite for about 48 bucks. </s>
<s> Video card - cheapest I would get is the 9600pro, mid would range from the 5900xt, 9800pro The motherboard I listed has onboard sound which is fine, and onboard ethernet. </s>
<s> The processor lacks a heatsink/fan, so be sure to get one. </s>
<s> I have the Thermaltake TR2 from CompUSA for 27 bucks. </s>
<s> Benchmarks show my proc beats a 3Ghz P4 EE. </s>
<s> I just put the 9600pro into a budget machine for a friend and it ran UT2004 beautifully. </s>
<s> I have the 5900xt and it runs Doom3 on high smoothly. </s>
<s> There are many places to look. </s>
<s> Newegg.com like the other gentleman said but also look at www.pricewatch.com. </s>
<s> Look at the barebone packages and add on from there. </s>
<s> brand name products are almost double in price for what you get. </s>
<s> I would wait another year for a 64 bit. </s>
<s> the prices will be cut in half. </s>
<s> Skip </s>
<s> Thank you both, I have been looking at Newegg already but I will check pricewatch as well. </s>
<s> Mainly the problem isn't knowing what I want but knowing which are the best but cheap brands. </s>
<s> I know I want an AMD, but 32bit vs. 64 bit is in the air. </s>
<s> Motherboards I have no idea about. </s>
<s> Memory, I assume I should get the PC3200 400Mhz DDR kind. </s>
<s> I actually don't need a video card and choosing a harddrive shouldnt be that hard. </s>
<s> Finally, I dont know anything about overclocking and that kind of stuff, but I will check into that &quot;dual channel&quot; mode you mentioned about the RAM. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> What software will you run? </s>
<s> For business software, an Athlon XP2600+ would be the best value. </s>
<s> If you want to run games, multimedia, CAD, Photoshop, etc. </s>
<s> then you should get an Athlon 64. http://techny.com/articles.cfm?getarticle=606&go=0.53769656 </s>
