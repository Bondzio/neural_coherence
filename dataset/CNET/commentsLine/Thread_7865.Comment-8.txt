since the waps can't stay at full speed we lose a lot of possible bandwidth.
if we did encounter a need for 802.11b it would be a simple matter to put a wap in for just that area for the 802.11b device.
for the time that an 802.11b spends on air, the 802.11g devices could have moved about 5 times as many bytes as the 802.11b device.
i don't want to upset you but has anyone told you about this?
