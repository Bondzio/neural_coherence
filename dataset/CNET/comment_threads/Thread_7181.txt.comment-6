Actual CPU mhz speeds are only a search away on the internet.
Google Search keywords : &quot;Athlon 2200+ mhz&quot; 2200+ Athlon = 1.8Ghz (133Mhz FSB x 13.5) Motherboards are generally set to 100Mhz FSB as this is the lowest FSB used by the AMD Durons that the boards can use.
By having it set as 100Mhz default allows every CPU to work at boot up without danger, but of course old Althons need the FSB increased to 133, and new XP lettered Athlons need this increased to 166Mhz.
