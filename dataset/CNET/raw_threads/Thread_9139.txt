This is not something easy to setup and those that can't find such logging software usually can't set it up. Sorry if it seems hard but it is. Again, look for SYSLOG http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog Now that you have SYSLOG on your PC, your router can forward messages to that and you have your monitoring. Bob
