Eventually, it just didn't install the device, and, since I don't use it, it wasn't missed. I rejigged the guts of my PC yesterday, and moved the soundcard to a different PCI slot. It redetected on Windows load, and it locks up -mouse, keyboard - everything - as soon as it detects the 'Soundblaster PCI128 Legact device' - I've removed all references in Device manager and rebooted - same problem. Any ideas?

Go to the Sound category, click the plus mark if it's not already opened up, right click the Legacy Device, and choose Properties. Once there, look for the box that says Disable In All Hardware Profiles and put a check mark in it. Click OK, and then reboot to see if the problem persists or if it fixes it. TONI

I did however disable the soundblaster's main driver in Safe Mode, then rebooted, and attempted to enable it. It detected the legacy device again, and hung the system. Any other ideas? Thanks again.

If it is WindowsXP then it normally detects & installs the Card (Eacept if it is not XP compatible certified in which case you need to have proper drivers) while Win9X needs the proper drivers. 2. The version & model of the card? There are quite a number of models & Vers of this name. Vibra, WDM etc. 3.
