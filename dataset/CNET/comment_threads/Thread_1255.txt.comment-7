Had some ATI aiw's at work and n_e_v_e_r got any of them to work- on 2000 or XP, 2 were rma's that they were able to verify bad when they had them back- replacements don't work either- gave up months ago.
Told PHB's- ATI's do not exist for me- if I find one in a box-1st hint of any trouble-out it comes..
