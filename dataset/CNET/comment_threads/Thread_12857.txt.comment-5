I got the router years ago and may or may not be able to find a how-to chapter on Setting WiFi router passwords.
My question, however, was whether or not there is one passwork/security key for the network and another one for the router, as the Epson error message has led me to believe.
I know the network password/security key works for the network, so why does the wirelss printer not take it?
