In short, no.
The CPU on most is soldered on the mainboard as well as the video section.
Laptops are usually relegated to memory and hard disk upgrades.
I got lucky and fitted my 4X CDRW with a new DVD/CDRW 24X drive.
The hard disk was some 11GB slug and now its a 40GB 5400 RPM drive.
Windows 2000 boots in 1/2 the time so I think it was worth the effort.
