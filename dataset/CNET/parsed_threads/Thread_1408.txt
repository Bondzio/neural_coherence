<s> I've got a bunch of mp3's and WAV files on an external HD on my PC. </s>
<s> I'd like to give them to a friend with a Mac. </s>
<s> Both computers have USB2 ports. </s>
<s> If I take my external HD over to his place and plug it into his Mac thru the USB2 port, can he copy the files to his computer? </s>
<s> To do this you want a partition in FAT32. </s>
<s> But FAT32 on USB is somewhat flaky so don't put what you can't lose on said drive. </s>

<s> Thanks, Bob, I wouldn't want to lose any of it. </s>
<s> What alternatives are there? </s>
<s> Obviously a DVD won't hold as much as an ext. </s>
<s> HD, but would a DVD burned from a PC be able to be read on a Mac? </s>
<s> It's a standard filesystem so unless you do something odd like use UDF (InCD, DirectCD, DLA) then it just works. </s>
