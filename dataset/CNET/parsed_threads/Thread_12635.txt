<s> Okay so I have a dell dimension 4600. </s>
<s> Pretty old, got it around 9 years a go. </s>
<s> It still works and is holding up. </s>
<s> I can do the usual stuff but if I have more than a few windows open, it starts to slow down big time. </s>
<s> Here are the stats: Intel&#174; Pentium&#174; 4 at 2.6ghz 256mb DDR RAM Nvidea GeForce FX 5200 and its running XP The CPU is fine, it doesn't use up more than 20% and it almost never even gets to 20%. </s>
<s> I don't need to upgrade video cards, I don't really play games and that will be for a different computer. </s>
<s> So I'm thinking of upgrading the ram. </s>
<s> So my PC runs Dual Channel DDR SDRAM and has four memory connectors. </s>
<s> The memory capacities are 128-, 256-, 512-MB or 1-GB. </s>
<s> The maximum memory supported is 4gb and the Memory types are PC2700 (333-MHz) or PC3200 (400-MHz) DDR SDRAM (non-ECC) So I was thinking of getting four 1gb sticks. </s>
<s> But I never really changed the hardware on my computer. </s>
<s> I know that RAM is easy to change because it doesn't store anything 1)but would I have to change anything in the BIOS? </s>
<s> 2)would it be a good idea or not, considering the fact that I may be getting a better computer in maybe a year? </s>
<s> Head to crucial.com and see how much but it's a common upgrade. </s>
<s> As to 4GB, be sure to not expect all that to show up on XP. </s>
<s> It's a common complaint that you read 1.9 to 3.5GB reported after this upgrade (varies with the machine) so some feel ripped off. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to 4gb because its not that much more in price than 2gb. </s>
<s> So you think I should get 2gb for xp? </s>
<s> I shared this because some felt cheated in some way. </s>
<s> There's more to this with 2.0GB limits per app but if 4.0GB is available and is cheap, why not? </s>
