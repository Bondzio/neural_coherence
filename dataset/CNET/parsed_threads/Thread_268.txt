<s> I have ATT DSL internet service with a 2wire wireless network router, which works ok, except for sporadic service interruptions. </s>
<s> From time to time there are 5-6 laptops and a printer working from it wirelessly and a Dish Network receiver wired to it. </s>
<s> Problem is; I have two other Dish receivers that need to be connecter by wire in different rooms/floors away from where the current 2wire router is located. </s>
<s> Is there something I can used to connect these receivers by wire to my existing wireless network from 2wire? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help! </s>
<s> I assume you just cannot run ethernet cable which is the best and most reliable. </s>
<s> There are 2 popular options. </s>
<s> The ethernet over powerline and a ethernet to wireless bridge. </s>
<s> The wireless bridge method tends to be a little cheaper and simpler to setup. </s>
<s> The system that carry the data over your electrical lines once they are setup are much less susceptible to random loss than wireless. </s>
<s> Thanks Bill - Correct, I don't want to run wires all over the house. </s>
<s> The Ethernet to wireless bridge sound like what I want to do. </s>
<s> Would the Linksys WET610N or similar be the device I would need. </s>
<s> Also, do you know if they make one of these with multi-port? </s>
<s> Since I'm hooking up the Dish receiver, if there is a multi-port device I could use the same device to hook-up the Blu-ray and TV. </s>
<s> I didn't think about those yesterday. </s>
<s> Again, thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I picked up the WGPS606 for 25 refurb and liked it so much I now have 2. </s>
<s> Look at that one too. </s>
