faster than shared ram and integrated video.
new PC's integrated video solutions are equivalent to entry level cards (geforce 6200 or radeon x1300 which are $50-$70 on the web).
spend $100 or more and you've got a *much* faster video card than any integrated graphics.
if you've got a PC more than 2 years old, the entry level cards I mentioned will be faster than the integrated graphics.
btw, you didn't mention what type of PC/motherboard nor what types of games.
that info's vital to make a good recommendation.
