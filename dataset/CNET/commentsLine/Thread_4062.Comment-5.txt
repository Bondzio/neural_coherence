wait i haven't tried using plastic i was asking if it would be better to use than aluminum foil and i was just predicting that it will get hot and melt but i don't actually now if it will melt or not.
the computer we have shouldn't get that hot anyways.. so should i use plastic replace the metal bracket that is too small?
