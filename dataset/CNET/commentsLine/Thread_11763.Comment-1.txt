hello, i realize my question is going to be a bit vague, but i have a computer, windows xp sp3, that has a main hd (c:) and a storage drive (g:).
there's nothing on the storage drive other than misc.
stuff like pictures taken, pdf files, work stuff etc.
(no installed software).
if i were to remove this, can i just as easily reinsert it and have it work as before or do i need to do something special to ensure the g: drive is read again?
