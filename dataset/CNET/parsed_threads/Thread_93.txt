<s> I have Comcast cable with a Motorola Surfboard modem model SB5120 installed 6/25/2005 so it's 5 years old now. </s>
<s> It goes to an AlphaShield then to a Neatgear WGT624v2 router. </s>
<s> A couple times a day it will disconnect. </s>
<s> The internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out. </s>
<s> Only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady. </s>
<s> Does that sound like the modem going out or a Comcast problem? </s>
<s> Is 5 years pretty old? </s>
<s> Or could it be my AlphaShield or router? </s>
<s> Maybe a little complain might help. </s>
<s> If I were Comcast I would definitely try to make you happy. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> doing this. </s>
<s> The modem is 5 years old, not the problem. </s>
<s> I bought the modem so I'm not renting it from Comcast. </s>
<s> So before I called Comcast I wanted to ask if it could be the modem going out which I would have to replace myself. </s>
<s> of course there's possibility that it could be bad. </s>
<s> The nice thing about a router-modem can be had for about $50. </s>
