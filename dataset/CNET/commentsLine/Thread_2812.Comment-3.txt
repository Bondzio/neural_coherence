if you know what you need and can't find it, then certainly pcp&c is close to whatever you need.
you may even want to talk to them for special needs provided you have the wallet for it.
in other words, you truly get what you pay for.
you may want to check this website:  i wish my end-uers had pcp&c just to step away from persistant atx power issues.
yeah, they're expensive but the end result is far better that what's usually offered out there.
good luck -----willy
