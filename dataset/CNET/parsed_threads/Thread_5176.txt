<s> I have verizon wireless broadband on my laptop with a Kyocera PCMIA card. </s>
<s> I want to give my laptop to my daughter. </s>
<s> Is there a simple device that I can get that will allow me to connect the PCMIA card to my desktop? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Verizon has a USB device for desktops but it is pricey like the Kycocera router and card for my desktop etc. </s>
<s> So I was hoping there is an inexpensive device that would let me use my PCMIA card on my desktop. </s>
<s> It seems like there is always a way to convert anything to work elsewhere! </s>

<s> I think these are PC-Card The difference is 32 vs. 16 bit interfaces and causes much grief and lost time if you get a simple PCMCIA to PCI adapter. </s>

<s> Try http://www.google.com/search?q=JJ-PC0011 Bob </s>
<s> http://www.quatech.com/catalog/drives_pcmcia.php and Elan makes one too but all around 200. </s>
<s> Keep shopping? </s>
<s> I sent them an inquiry to see if their device supports the kyocera air card. </s>
<s> Otherwise I think the router is the way to go - it is available for 150 and allows flexibility for the future. </s>
<s> I also see it hard wires to a PC so the desktop doesn't need wireless capability. </s>
<s> The question is whether they support PC-Card or not. </s>
<s> The card supports 3G (or not) so you've posed a question that should not be asked. </s>
<s> Sorry if that seems harsh, odd or off the wall but that's the quick and bitter truth. </s>
<s> As to supporting the Kyocera Air Card now that's something they might answer since they may have reports from the field. </s>
<s> -&gt; The bottom line is that it's you that will have to install the PC-Card adapter it's drivers then the drivers for your card. </s>
<s> Miss one of those items and it won't work. </s>
<s> Support will be light so it's best you be a little self reliant and have done the usual driver installs over the years. </s>
<s> Many dive in and plug the parts in but want to call in and have tech support walk them through the software drivers install. </s>
<s> Those types have the worst experiences. </s>

<s> Bob, I was able to get a kr1 router for 105 shipped from an ebay seller on a best offer deal. </s>
<s> I really don't understand everything you were saying about the question I asked, but I do appreciate your help! </s>
<s> I do know about drivers but I will probably have some questions anyway. </s>
<s> I find these forums to be a lot more plain speaking than the EVDO forums. </s>
<s> Yup, I thought that needed a rewrite. </s>
<s> Sorry about that. </s>
