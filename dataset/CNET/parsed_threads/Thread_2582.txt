<s> I have a new Dell Studio and want an external hard drive for added storage and to prevent slow down. </s>
<s> What are the disadvantages of the portable unit? </s>
<s> Is the battery running down a problem? </s>
<s> It would be nice to have a portable so you didn't have to deal with a cord all the time, but I'm just not sure about how a portable compares in performance to a regular external HD. </s>
<s> Also, could you recommend a particular model with at least 500GB or preferably a little more? </s>
<s> Let me start with a warning. </s>
<s> External drives are far less reliable than internal drives. </s>
<s> If you want to use it for storage, be sure to have a good backup of everything you put on it and don't want to lose. </s>
<s> A second and third hard disk are fine, burning to DVD is fine, webbased storage is fine. </s>
<s> Having no backup is a potential disaster. </s>
<s> An external hard drive always connects via a USB2-cable (or Firewire if you have a Mac). </s>
<s> It can be USB-powered (which uses some power from the laptop, indeed) or externally powered (power adaptor). </s>
<s> That doesn't make a difference for the performance. </s>

<s> Are you saying that a portable HD doesn't have its own battery - it just works off the laptops battery? </s>
