I had thought that for some reason that when it hit that speed it was the type that was compatible with dual module configurations giving twice the effective bandwidth and that would make it ddr2. Have I figured that out wrong? My motherboard is only a 533 mhz bus cpu capable model but it says in the specs it can use pc 3200. On one site it said that ddr2 uses 1.8 volts as opposed to 2.5 but my system is running it at 2.5. Some concerns have arisen.

DDR2 only provides greater bandwidth as determined by its speed. Howevwer it has higher latency thus direct comparisons between each is not simple. Dual channel is attained by have two completely separate memory busses, one for each of the memory sticks of the pair. The two paths continue thru the MCH to the CPU and thus Dual Channel memory reads are 128 buts in length while single channel is 64 bits. That's where the double memory bandwidth come from.

Go here. http://www.crucial.com/ There is lots of good info about mem. If you know the make and model of your mobo use the mem finder...it will tell you what fits...ddr/ddr2/ddr?/dual channel/single channel.

Install single. Install pairs. If the mobo is capable of dual channel I suspect Crucial will recommend installing in pairs.

The regular socket 754 CPU DOES NOT support Dual Channel but does allow use of standard [not registerd] memeory. This can cause much confusion.
