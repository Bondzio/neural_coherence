Hi, I'm wondering if the ATI Radeon HD7750 would be okay to use in an HP Pavillion 6610f system with a 250w psu.
I know a 400w supply is recommended for it, but I've read a few others' opinions that say 250w would be fine because of the card's low power draw.
I just want to make sure if it'll work or not before I consider buying a new psu.
My system specs: AMD Athlon II x4 635(2.90Ghz) 4GB DDR3 750GB SATAII 7200RPM DVD-RW ATI Radeon HD 4200 graphics Windows 7 64-bit 250w Lite-On PS-5251 08, 12V@14A
