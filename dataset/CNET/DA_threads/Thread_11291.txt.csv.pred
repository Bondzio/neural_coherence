1.1.1	I was thinking about getting a new PC for gaming and found this Lenovo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883108591 and http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814162085 because its GFX card isn't good for gaming.	St
1.1.2	Is that a good gaming PC or could I get a better one in the $800-$1000 price range?	St
1.1.3	I also had my eye on http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229283 but it got sold out last night.	St
1.2.1	That's not a gaming machine.	St
1.2.2	Your looking at an immediate swap of the psu and the gpu.	St
1.2.3	300 extra bucks just to get it to a mid-range gamer.	St
1.2.4	Keep shopping.	St
