i have a d-link boxee box that i want to use to stream hd movies/tv locally and from the internet.
i have beeen looking at new routers like the netgear n900 to increase my speed and throughput.
i would then go from: modem&gt;router&gt;switch&gt;boxee(and other devices)&gt;tv i need the switch as i have other devices in my entertainment system that require internet access.
my question is even if i buy a superfast router ,will my through put be limited by the switch??
thanks robert
