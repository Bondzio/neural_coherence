I have a wireless connection at home, but I wanted to use internet on the go. Do I have to purchase like a monthly plan or could I purchase some hours as I go? Could someone help me with this, please? Saira

Be prepared for a hefty setup charge and a monthly bill, probably with a one or two year contract. Call'em. Don't expect home connection speed. Bring money.
