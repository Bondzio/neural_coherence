I have a second hard drive in my system that was set up to shadow the C drive. I disabled that second drive after I received the computer, so this drive is essentially new. Do I have to do anything to the second drive, since it does have a couple of files on it to be able to use it as a primary drive? Any help would be appreciated. I am running Windows XP Home Edition.

It just hasn't been used, because I disabled the shadowing. (Kinda wish now that I hadn't.) So there is no copy program that I am aware of. I'll dig out the disk and take a look.

If you had shared the make of the drives I might have found that maker's free copy software. But you can look too. Bob
