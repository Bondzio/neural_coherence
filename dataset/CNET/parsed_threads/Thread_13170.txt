<s> I'm building a new computer and was wondering how big of a power supply I'd need. </s>
<s> Below are some of the components AMD X2 4400 ATI X1900XT PCI Express 512mb Hauppauge 500 Dual TV tuner Creative Soundblaster X-Fi XtremeMusic 2 400 gb sata harddrives 2 DVD Drives (1 DVD Burner, 1 DVDROM) Any reccomendation? </s>
<s> Would 500Watts be ok? </s>
<s> Or should I go a bit higher? </s>
<s> I don't want to cause problems, but also don't want to have a really noisy machine. </s>
<s> Thanks, I appreciate all that have helped with my questions on this forum for building my new comp. </s>

<s> Good afternoon, I have an AMD Athlon 3500+ with 2 GB of ram (4 3200 crucial DDR pieces, not super fast RAM), 4 hard drives adding up to 1.3 TB an ATI All IN Wonder AIW x300 video card, built in audio, I forget the motherboard, a crummy ECS something or other. </s>
<s> Got the cpu and MB deal at Fry's electronics a while back. </s>
<s> 1 dvdrw drive - NEC. </s>
<s> I run a 550 watt power supply unit with dual fans, i think it is the Antec TruePower 2.0 550W. </s>
<s> I have had it running almost 24-7 for about 10 months. </s>
<s> Works well. </s>
<s> I would play it safe if you are going to increase the number of hard drives later. </s>
<s> I increased mine and probably will again. </s>
<s> Plus, you have a power sucker video card with a tv tuner card and the audio card. </s>
<s> Get the Enermax 660 watt model EPS12V 660W. </s>
<s> A bit pricy but with the machine you have, it's worth it. </s>
<s> I have that one on my other machine, it's awesome. </s>
<s> Super cool, air never flows warm out of that thing, even when I used to live in Riverside, CA (pretty warm/hot place). </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>
<s> I saw really good reviews on this one at NewEgg Antec TRUEPOWERII TPII-550 ATX12V 550W http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103931 Any thoughts for my configuration? </s>

<s> Having a high wattage unit installed won't hurt your system. </s>
<s> The system will take what it needs on demand. </s>
<s> The bigger the wattage the better the wattage cushion as system needs grow. </s>
<s> Yeah, it's big enough BUT it must be a namebrand psu. </s>
<s> That way, you'll get the true stable output any system will need. </s>
<s> Heck, they're 600W+ psu out there now. </s>
<s> Consider, whatever the final calculations are for your needs then add 25% to it for a good indication of a good fit. </s>

<s> Radeon X1900 GT - Product Specifications System Requirements * PCI Express based PC is required with one x16 lane graphics slot available on the motherboard * Connection to the system power supply is required * 400-Watt power supply or greater, 25 Amps, 12 volt rail recommended (assumes fully loaded system) * For CrossFire: 550 watt power supply or greater, 38 Amps, 12 volt rail * 512MB of system memory * Installation software requires CD-ROM drive * DVD playback requires DVD drive and decoder software (not included) By all get a good PS with some room to spare....500W would be good plus some room to grow. </s>
