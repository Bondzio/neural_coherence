<s> I have a Samsung TS-H552 DVD+RW. </s>
<s> A website for the SPECS is http://www.overclockersclub.com/reviews/samsung_ts-h552_dvd_burner.php Now my problem is that the burner will allow me to read/write to CD's, but wont read/write DVD's. </s>
<s> Perhaps someone could help me? </s>
<s> My pc specs are as follows: P3 1.31 GHZ NvIDIA GEFORCE 4 64MB Windows XP PRO 768 MB SDRAM More than enough to support the drive, i jsut need some help...anyone out there? </s>

<s> I had the same problem you do; I purchased a NEC DVD burner and could play CDs, but not DVDs, even though I had installed the basic Nero software that came with the drive. </s>
<s> I contacted NEC and was told that the DVD Codec I needed was available from (intervideo) WinDVD or other such sources. </s>
<s> I installedd the 30 day trial version and the player worked as it should. </s>
<s> I immediately purchased the full version once I was confidant that my issue was resolved. </s>
<s> You can go to Intervideo's site and download the trial version to see if that helps. </s>

<s> Probably has something like PowerDVD. </s>
<s> You need to install that, too. </s>

<s> Any suggestions on software besides Nero, i have tried that and it didnt work, i spent 4 hours as it was doing something, then when it was finished doing what ever it was doing, it ejected my BLANK DVD and asked for a blank DVD. </s>
<s> Nero could have spent 4 hours preparing some video to record. </s>
<s> But there is no story here so I can't offer any other suggestion than CDBURNERXP. </s>
<s> I can't tell if this will do what you want since you didn't tell much. </s>
