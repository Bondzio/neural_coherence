I am looking at upgrading my system to either an i5 or i7.
I don' want to spend a lot of money on something I don't really need.
However I would like it to last for at least 2 to 4 years.
I do some onling gaming (but not hard core).
Microsoft office suite, Internet, Netflix, and remote work.
I would like to reuse some if my hardware if Possible (if not, oh well).
Here are the specs of my current system: CPU: 2.40 gigahertz Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L MEMORY: G-Skill 4GB DDR2-800 SDRAM VIDEO CARD: ATI Radeon HD 5670 (1024 MB) AUDIO CARD: Creative SB X-Fi Fatality XtremeGamer HARD DRIVE 1: Seagate ST3250310NS (250 GB, 7200 RPM, SATA-II) HARD DRIVE 2: Western Digital WD300GLFS-01F8U0 (300 GB IDE) POWER SUPPLY: PC Power & Cooling Silencer Mk II 750W MONITOR: 42&quot; Samsung LED TV CASE: Cooler Master CM-690 OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows XP Pro I have looked at the ASUS P8Z77-V Boards and they look nice.
however do I need something like that?
any and all recomenndations will be appreciated.
