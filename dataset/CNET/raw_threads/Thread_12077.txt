I can't guess how long you've been at this but when you wrote &quot;stable storage&quot; it makes me think you are just beginning to see the problem. Keep at it. Make more copies and your data may be safe. Bob

Yes, its been that long. Any certification is going to be costly and mean nothing to those that lose data. Why is that an issue here? Bob
