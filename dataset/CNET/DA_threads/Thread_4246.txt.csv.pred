1.1.1	My question is.. Would adding a decent HD graphics card be beneficial over onboard graphics ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 've heard that it will free up RAM , and help the CPU perform better but idk.. i dont game alot , but i do like HD video editing .	St
1.1.3	My computer is a SFF , and the best Low Profile graphics card deal i have found is a 2GB Radeon HD5450 card .	St
1.1.4	Current Specs : Dell Optiplex 755 SFF Stock Mobo Intel Q6600 2.4 GHz ( SLACR , G0 Stepping ) 4GB DDR2 RAM ( bout to upgrade to 8 ) Windows 7 HP 64 Bit 1.0 TB WD Caviar Black SATA HD I capture Halo Gameplay with a Hauppauge HD PVR Gaming Edition , and edit with Sony Vegas Pro 9.0c	St
1.2.1	Provided you used the PC is question and found it lacking in video needs that choice is yours .	St
1.2.2	Yes , adding a new video card will free ram back for PC system use once the on-board video is disabled .	St
1.2.3	In most cases , you 'll increase video capabilities beyond on-board which are basic or OEM requirements match .	St
1.2.4	i do suggest you review any new video cards specs and find out if replacing the PSU for for required needs ( or better ) and lets not exclude cooling as well .	Ques
1.2.5	Doing this for the new video card is best for continued use to become less problematic .	St
1.2.6	The more demanding the video card the more attention to details for the best overall operation becomes a MUST .	St
1.2.7	So do n't discount this because it may work for some time then start to falter later .	St
1.2.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	No about freeing up RAM .	St
1.3.2	Years ago they used to do that , today it creates too many support calls so I see most machines do n't release onboard video ram .	St
1.3.3	Some BIOS may allow you to reduce it but the trend is away from such for a very simple reason .	St
1.3.4	Folks no longer want to tweak machines ( most ! )	St
1.3.5	So I have one more comment .	St
1.3.6	The 5450 is a good solution for those machines like you noted but the 2GB might be DDR2 RAM .	St
1.3.7	If so , get the slightly faster 1GB DDR3 card .	St
1.3.8	What game did you want to try that needed that 2GB Video Card ?	Ques
1.3.9	Most of today 's games are fine with 1GB .	St
1.3.10	And the games that want more would run poorly on this card .	St
1.3.11	Bob	St
1.4.1	The 2GB HD5450 i ordered has DDR3 Memory	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
