First off, I have this old HP 750n using XP that I am hooking up to my TV in my loft. My router is a Linksys WRT320n connected to my Dell XPS420 using Vista Ultimate....with no problems. Every time I try to set this adapter up, it shuts the PC down or has a hardware installation error come up saying that the Adapter hasn't passed Windows Logo Testing to verify it's compatibility with Windows XP. The HP passes all of the requirements for this to work and is fully updated. The box says this adapter is good for Vista, XP or even Windows 2000... Does anyone have any ideas on what the problem is.... If you need additional information I am more that willing to give it.... Any help will be greatly appreciated.... Thanks Flu

Proffitt	6/9/09 5:12 AM	1.24452432E12	About &quot;Windows Logo Testing&quot;	If you must have products that pass this then for this device you must return it now as many makers do not bother with Windows Logo Testing. There are fees and more to be paid to get that testing done. Try another product. Bob
