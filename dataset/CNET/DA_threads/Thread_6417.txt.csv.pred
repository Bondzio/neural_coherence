1.1.1	This morning my monitor just switched off, couldn't get it back on - unplugged from AC unplugged from PC - back and forth - changing cable nothing.	St
1.1.2	Finally I found out that if I press in the adjacent button to the TURN ON button on the panel - then both - the screen would come on.	St
1.1.3	I kept doing that for about 15 very long minutes.	St
1.1.4	It would first stay on - then it just would turn off.	St
1.1.5	Then I started getting weird PC problems.	St
1.1.6	It would go into sleep mode, couldn't turn it on, then couldn't turn it off.	St
1.1.7	Then it started REALLY slowing down.	St
1.1.8	I said that's it, I probably have either a faulty video card/controller or I've got some kind of virus.	St
1.1.9	I cleaned the machine 2x with AV's - one avast the other with F-Secure.	St
1.1.10	Both times clean.	St
1.1.11	Same with Malwarebytes.	St
1.1.12	Then I took out all the plugs and just started cleaning the whole inside - thinking maybe there's a faulty connection or a dirty socket or something.	St
1.1.13	Turned it on - same thing.	St
1.1.14	Went into MSCONFIG and had a look around - took off some services not belonging to MS or anything important.	St
1.1.15	Then cleaned out the systems file with Disk Clean.	St
1.1.16	Then cleaned out the registry with a few programs.	St
1.1.17	The PC is now on with the monitor - but because this is so out of the norm I want to know how I can pinpoint the problem if it's connected to the video card/controller etc.	St
1.1.18	I ran a diagnostics with Everest but couldn't make much of what I read there.	St
1.1.19	Any help - sure would be very much appreciated indeed.	St
1.1.20	melamedet	St
1.2.1	it is lacking in details about the system itself; meaning that to help you with your problem, we need more details about your computer setup: CPU (Intel or AMD...i3, Pentium 4 ?)	St
1.2.2	motherboard (manufacturer...ASUS, MSI, Intel ?)	St
1.2.3	videocard (ATI, Intel, NVidia ?)	St
1.2.4	getting the picture?	St
