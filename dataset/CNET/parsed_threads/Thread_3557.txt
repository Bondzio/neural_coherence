<s> Hey All, Well I am writing you from my new T6212 I put in 2-512MB pc3200 sticks, I had enough and got a x800xl (or is it xt, ah i forget but $299 at compusa, pci-e). </s>
<s> I formatted all the oem stuff and installed my Win xp sp2 , had to go find the sound card driver but that was easy. </s>
<s> I am installing World of Warcraft now, so we will see how it performs but I suspect well. </s>
<s> It's patching to current build, takes a bit from scratch. </s>
<s> I will update after I play a bit :P I also got the 19&quot; crt from Best buy, Insignia, their signiture brand, genereric I guess lol but it has quite a good picture and I am very pleased :P Only $129, so that's nice. </s>
<s> The only thing I have to install hardware wise is a wireless pci adapter. </s>
<s> Waiting to move the pc to do that though. </s>
<s> No hurry since it's not needed yet. </s>
<s> It's operating very very well. </s>
<s> Talk to you all soon and let you knwo how well it performs on 3d Thanks for everyones input too SeaninWa </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Let us kno how everything works out. </s>
<s> Thats why I love the T6212, just a few upgrades and the thing can fly. </s>
<s> Such a great deal. </s>
<s> Hey, So ya it's going very well. </s>
<s> It handles multitasking like a charm, I am playing World of Warcraft while I type this and have 2 downloads (torrents)going while sharing at max upload speed. </s>
<s> Early I was installing 3 things at once, all went very quickly. </s>
<s> I unzipped 3 things at once while downloading a couple things and it did studder a bit but got through it pretty well if you asked me. </s>
<s> The x800 is performing well also. </s>
<s> I am not going to overclock it as I just dont think it's necessary really. </s>
<s> Plus I have the psu issue and less is more here lol. </s>
<s> In wow with 4xaa8xaf and 1600x1200 everything else turned max I get 25-40 fps in populated areas and a bit higher 10 or so fps in non populated areas. </s>
<s> I kinda thought I was gonna get more but it doesn't matter really as it's completely playable at those rates. </s>
<s> It look terrific, as much as it can. </s>
<s> I don't think the textures are as detailed as I would like but that's the coding not the video card I suspect. </s>
<s> I didn't add a sound card and I am perfectly happy with it as it is, works fine for me. </s>
<s> I have a subwoofer and 2 speakers and it's great for me. </s>
<s> Plus again I have the psu issues to worry about so again less is more :P I getting some other games via online now and am going to try them out and see what happens but it really seems to be doing very well. </s>
<s> I hope it keeps it up. </s>
<s> The cpu is running 31 degrees which I believe is good. </s>
<s> So that's nice to know. </s>
<s> I don't know what else to add but if I think of anything I will let you all know. </s>
<s> If you have any specific questions feel free to leave a post and I will see if I can get you an answer :P So, yes it was a great investment SeaninWa </s>
<s> the info and updates, SW! </s>
<s> I'm recommending the T6212 to some of my friends. </s>
<s> JDM </s>
<s> I have installed a 6600 GT OC, two 512 sticks of ram, a $20 soundblaster card (the onboard sound when playing Half life 2 sucked) it sounds great now, and a 450 watt power supply. </s>
<s> The computer really kicks ass now, I can play the newest games with all of the graphics turned up with no problem! </s>
<s> AND when you decide to go SLI all you have to do is buy a new motherboard! </s>
<s> Also it is a 64bit AMD, so when the new 64bit windows comes out, you are ready to go! </s>
<s> ALSO, it is theoretically possible to shoehorn an Athlon 64 FX-55 processor and its heat sink into the T6212. </s>
<s> So, get one! </s>
<s> Where did you get the 450W power supply from that will fit in the T6212 case?? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> have fun with ur new toy..seaninwa any particular reason to go with x800xl instead of 6600gt? </s>
<s> x800xl is like double performance of 6600gt. </s>
<s> the x800xl competes with nvidia 6800gt. </s>
<s> it is between 6800gt and 6800 ultra. </s>
<s> the x800xl has 256bit memory interface and 16 pixel lines. </s>
<s> if u have the money, u should definitely go for the x800xl or 6800gt instead of the 6600gt </s>
<s> Thx nerdyboy, how about powersupply needs of x800xl..is 300W enough? </s>
<s> I am yet to get into gaming. </s>
<s> Currently main purpose of my video card will be for HTPC. </s>
<s> Do u know, if x800XL good for HTPC over DVI outputs. </s>
<s> at CompUSA, It's a Mad Dog SurePower 450watt. </s>
<s> $80 Fits perfectly, you need no extra cables or parts to install. </s>
<s> x800xl is an extremely powerful graphics card. </s>
<s> basically same specs as the highest end ati radeon x850xt, just slower clock speeds. </s>
<s> if u do get into gaming, u will have a very potent system. </s>
<s> ATI cards are fast, but lack the technology support by nvidia such as FP3.0 i think and others, which would render these cards useless in the coming years. </s>
<s> ATI wants you to keep upgrading and buying their cards along with intel, they changed their socket to not be able to upgrade to dual-core. </s>
<s> No wonder ati and intel are basically partners when you build a system. </s>
<s> That's why gamers buy amd, which allows you to upgrade, and nvidia. </s>
<s> By all means, if you want brute force, get the intel and ati, but for the future and compatibility and the fastest game experience, but not the best for encoding,etc. </s>
<s> get amd and nvidia. </s>
