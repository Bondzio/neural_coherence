That other post ends with you giving them a thank you.
If that was not the correct answer then you should have said that that code wasn't working for you.
Me?
I author some apps that use BlueTooth so I know a little about this.
But for a specific device like this you go back to the maker if the usual codes fail and there is no manual.
And if the product is defective (no manual is a defective) we know to toss it and get something better.
And then we have those no code pairing systems.
That would send the person who believes there is a code in a forever search for that non-existent paring code!
