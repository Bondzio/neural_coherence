<s> Greetings, I am having two issues: 1) When I power on....the system repeatedly goes off then back on (maybe even 6-9 x's) then it stays on with no problem. </s>
<s> I am using a rather large 1000 watt power supply. </s>
<s> Could this be a possible BIOS power issue? </s>
<s> Single rail PSU adjusting voltage? </s>
<s> MOBO protecting itself due to to much power? </s>
<s> What is strange is that I had the exact same problem so I returned all the products thinking something was defective....now the exact same problem.....something possibly is not compatible. </s>
<s> Symptoms appear to be a short but I dont think it is. </s>
<s> I carefully put all motherboard off sets from the case and did not overtighten any screws. </s>
<s> When the power goes off and on....everything lights up....fans kick on....led's light up.....then bam off for about 1 second on for like 4 then off for 1 .....happens again and again...... 2) Graphics card is receiving power because I see the lights.....but monitor remains black. </s>
<s> Mointor will not detect the card whatsoever. </s>
<s> I checked the obvious power to the monitor..etc...etc... Im a one desperate frustrated NOOB! </s>
<s> I want to diagnose this power issue first. </s>
<s> I listed my Hardware below. </s>

<s> just kill you if you took the bunch of stuff to a computer shop and have it professionally troubleshot? </s>
<s> And you gain something out of it? </s>
<s> It can't be a money issue and what better way is there to learn? </s>
<s> disconnect everything. </s>
<s> connect the power supply to the mobo. </s>
<s> connect the cpu cooler to the mobo. </s>
<s> connect the optical drive only. </s>
<s> install 1 stick of ram. </s>
<s> if you have access to a pci-based video card, use it instead of the gx2. </s>
<s> if you must use the gx2, make sure you're using an 8pin and a 6pin power connector since two 6pin connectors won't work. </s>

<s> You tried it in 32-bit Vista or 32-bit XP? </s>
<s> You used just one stick of RAM? </s>
<s> You have the latest BIOS, firmwares, drivers or asked each maker which version they suggest? </s>
<s> You have an install procedure such as http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 where we have our dozen drivers and follow the install to the t. Bob </s>

<s> Im not experienced enought to know whether the three components above will jive. </s>

<s> Sorry I see my advice is not usable here. </s>

<s> Im at work presently and do have access to the forum but not the computer....hmmmm....just wandering if anybody knew before I get home and continue to diagnose? </s>

<s> Those 4 items are what I do when I see a cranky machine. </s>
<s> I forgot one item and that is to leave the case cover off however some will rail against that and write &quot;the temperatures are ok.&quot; Again, you may be passing up the usuals. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If the &quot;screen remains black&quot; then we're apparently not getting past POST. </s>
<s> Doesn't sound like PSU problem (brand new and plenty of headroom). </s>
<s> RAM that doesn't work with the mobo would be consistent with the symptoms, but ramarc is saying the RAM is compatible. </s>
<s> So go thru the rest of the list: CPU, mobo, or RAM is faulty, or things aren't plugged in correctly. </s>
<s> I'll reinforce the suggestion of taking it to a local shop. </s>
<s> There they'll be able to quickly test the components, and verify the assembly. </s>
<s> One of the smaller shops in my town I know would let you hover and learn while they work, particularly if you came during a slower time (mid-day weekday). </s>
<s> Aint this some &quot;YOU KNOW WHAT&quot; This is directly off of ASUS website --- apparently a bios issue between my board and the amd 9850: 0901 2008/05/29 update Description 0901 BIOS 1.Fix the problem that CrashFree function is abnormal sometimes. </s>
<s> 2.Fix the problem that it may takes 4 to 8 times of cold boot to enter OS with Phenom 9850 and 9950 CPUs. </s>
<s> 3.Fix the problem that the chassis fan will suddenly stop. </s>
<s> File Size 745.33 (KBytes) So.....I call and get a extremely rude tech from ASUS....he said there is no way that I can update that bios myself. </s>
<s> I will have to call tommorow to order a updated cmos chip. </s>
<s> What a drag. </s>
<s> Dont even know if I believe him cuz he was such a jerk. </s>
<s> System will stay on after about 9 off an on's....I feel like im gonna blow something at the number of offs and ons im going through. </s>
<s> Computer is not posting, no beeps, no video. </s>
<s> WOW........tempted to just return the board and cpu again. </s>
<s> Hate to do that though but jeezamoley. </s>
<s> No way its a short now......A bios that would not even allow the system to boot was the last thing on my mind. </s>
<s> I kept thinking that this was a component that was not installed right. </s>
<s> Just dang sick. </s>
<s> Hopefully if someone out there happens to run in this issue...maybe our post would help them. </s>

<s> Greetings, After some long hard work and help from the forums.....I have the box up and running. </s>
<s> The board was not compatible with the cpu until a bios update was performed. </s>
<s> I found a old am2 sempron, threw it in....then updated the bios....then all power issues were resolved with the 9850. </s>
<s> Also, the ram was a problem, would not boot with that Corsair. </s>
<s> So....bottom line is that I had two issue going on. </s>
<s> Tons of work was done thinking that this was a short or connection...etc..etc...for all the newbs out there wanting to build....DONT GIVE UP....KEEP DIGING. </s>
<s> The payoff of building your own system compared to buying .... is infinite...money and performance wise. </s>
<s> The only issue that im having now is the board sees one type of hdd but not another....another post is inevitable but im certainly getting there with everyones help. </s>
<s> thanks, RedTail </s>
<s> I GOT IT .... </s>
<s> Here is what I did.... 1. </s>
<s> Download the 901 bios from asus and put it on a flash drive from another pc, to be safe I had the zip file, the unzipped directory, and the 901.bin file all on the root since I didnt know which one it would recognize. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Remove the 2 sticks of ram in the black slots, leaving only the 2 in the yellow slots. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Start the machine, it should post and let you enter the bios. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Go to the ez-Flash utility in the bios, and flash it to 901 from the USB drive. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Restart, enter the bios, and under chipset uptions change the voltage of the ram to 2.1, and the speed to 800mhz. </s>
<s> 6.Shut down, install the 2 sticks of ram that you removed, It should now boot and allow you to install the O.S. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> After you have the O.S. </s>
<s> (xp64 for me) installed, and all of the service packs installed, you can now go back and increase the ram speed to 1066mhz.... </s>
<s> This is step by step how I got it to work... </s>
<s> I will check back to see if anyone hase any questions. </s>
<s> Good luck, </s>
