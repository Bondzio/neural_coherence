alright so i tried installing a new sound card on my custom built machine.
when i went to turn it on and install the new drivers, when it wouldn't boot.
nothing!
i hit the power and the led lights come on fans kick in but no video signal is sent and the monitor just goes into stand-by.
what could be my problem here?
i am thinking mobo, but hoping maybe just the ram.
how to i check before buying all new?
?
