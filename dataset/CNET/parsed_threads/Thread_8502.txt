<s> Hello Sir, I need help to extend wifi from my home to office. </s>
<s> My office is located in 1 mile of range from my house and it is surrounded by many houses. </s>
<s> I already bought TP Link products but I have not get success. </s>
<s> I bought following products: * 2 antennas: TL-ANT2424B * 2 Access Points: TL-WA701ND * 2 pigtails: TL-ANT24PT Would you please help me to get successful extension for my wifi? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> Your solution in good for the 100's of feet so not going to cut it. </s>
<s> Since there is no line of sight, you'll run afoul of FCC regulations. </s>
<s> So the best solution may be a tethered phone. </s>
<s> Here I can use a Virgin Mobile android phone (99 bucks at target.com) and it's 35 buck a month plan plus Easytether for 15 bucks. </s>
<s> I'm done. </s>
<s> NO LINE OF SIGHT means no good cheap solution. </s>
<s> Why isn't internet service an option? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
