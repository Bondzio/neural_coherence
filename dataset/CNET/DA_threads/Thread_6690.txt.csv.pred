1.1.1	I have a Dell Desktop running Windows XP.	St
1.1.2	I recently purchased a brand new Epson printer (the exact same model of the one I had before), I installed the printer and all of the software, but my computer will not recognize the printer.	St
1.1.3	I think my ports may be bad (is it possible that all 5 ports can be bad?)	St
1.1.4	I have spent numerous hours on the phone with Dell, Microsoft and Epson and no one can pin point the problem, (each manufacturer is blaming the other) My computer is working just fine I'm not having any other issues with my OS.	St
1.1.5	I tried to plug in my digital camera and once again, the computer will not recognize that either.	St
1.1.6	I have done all of the basic trouble shooting that I know to do, I have gone to the device manager to check for any weird errors and everything looks fine.	St
1.1.7	I called a local company and they say that my OS is hosed.	St
1.1.8	I don't know what else to do any help would be greatly appreciated!	St
1.2.1	What if you reformat your hard drive.	St
1.2.2	If they say your OS is hosed.	St
1.2.3	Reinstall your Windows XP.	St
1.3.1	Try Uninstalling everything that involves the printer.	St
1.3.2	Then go to the epson website and install just the drivers (no other epson junk).	St
1.3.3	Many companies will include their own utilities and junk you dont need.	St
1.3.4	I have worked on machines where the extra stuff disrupts the driver itself causing the device to not work.	St
1.3.5	I have seen this on printers, networks adapters, and digital cameras.	St
1.3.6	So, try installing just the drivers and no other software.	Sug
1.3.7	Also, epson is a popular brand and may have a driver already in XP.	St
1.3.8	That was the case with my HP printer and windows installed a universal driver automatically.	St
1.3.9	So, I would try to: 1. uninstall it and related software 2. unplgg printer from power and computer 3. restart computer 4. plug printer into computer 5. plug printer into power and turn on 6.	St
1.3.10	If it hasnt already happened, the new hardware popup will show up and give it a generic driver.	St
1.3.11	7.If none of this works, try backing up your data and reinstalling windows.	St
1.3.12	A fresh copy of windows will definetly fix the problem if all else fails Evan	Sug
1.4.1	Agree with EaC430 - do that.	St
1.4.2	P.S.	St
1.4.3	Instead of calling the companies, go watch some TV and have a good time.	St
1.4.4	You'll accomplish just as much.	St
1.4.5	The companies usually don't care, their main concern is bag on anyone else who might be involved if they can't fix the problem.	St
1.4.6	If the techie doesn't give you a straight answer within 5 minutes, he/she doesn't know.	St
1.4.7	-aintel	St
1.5.1	I have a digital camera and when I got this new computer I didn't install all the crap and it used a standard camera/scanner driver to upload the pics.	St
1.5.2	That Kodak Easy share stuff took over my old computer.	St
1.6.1	Try to boot your system with a Bootable Linux CD while a USB disk drive connected.	St
1.6.2	If it mounts the drive automatically, your USB ports are fine.	St
1.6.3	If not, you have a hardware problem.	St
1.6.4	I had the same problem, too.	St
1.7.1	that your USB ports may not be active because of the BIOS settings.	St
1.7.2	Why not just have a peep in the BIOS setup and see if the USB ports are active?	St
