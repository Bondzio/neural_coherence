<s> I had to install a new motherboard because the other quite. </s>
<s> How do i get the machine to install the drivers for this new motherboard? </s>
<s> It just boots up to a screen that says bootup was interupted and will never boot up on the driver disk. </s>
<s> Or I guess even recognize the board. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Can't comment much without the name of the OS, but for many the words are XP REPAIR INSTALL on google.com Bob </s>
<s> It is XP. </s>
<s> My otherboard quite so i could not install the new motherboard drivers before installing the board. </s>
<s> It is the motherboard drivers i need to install. </s>
<s> XP REPAIR INSTALL Take your pick of which one you want to use from google.com Bob </s>
<s> The computer will only but up and say: We apoligize for the inconvienience blaah blahh. </s>
<s> I was not able to download the new motherboard drivers on the hard drive before installing it. </s>
<s> 99% of time it will correct the OS and save the owner's files they didn't backup. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate the instructions here since it's best you pick the instructions that make sense to you. </s>

<s> Do you know if a PC chips Motherboard will work in a emachine with a new maxtor hard drive? </s>
<s> and with the emachines o.s. </s>
<s> and drivers? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Windows XP activation kicks in and since the OS is not on a Emachines board, fails. </s>
<s> No big surprise here. </s>
<s> The license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The repairs for XP I noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of XP. </s>
<s> In the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress. </s>
<s> I think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here. </s>
