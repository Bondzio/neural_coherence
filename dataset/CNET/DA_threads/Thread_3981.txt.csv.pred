St
1.4.2	Anything else I can change to save money?	St
1.5.1	IMO If it's 32bit it doesn't matter , I personally like amd chips because the onboard graphics is radeon based and I like the force options for resolution , but anything ~ 2-3 ghz processor and 2+ gb ram would be sufficient for what you require !	St
1.5.2	If it's 64 bit IMO I go with an amd 64 bit dual core ~ 2-3 ghz and 2gb ram.... Iknow alot of ppl like intel but I like and notice the extra cache per cost on amd You can shave more $$ if you rethink your needs and cost.	St
1.6.1	Going for a cheaper build using build in CPU graphics: http://tinyurl.com/3fnjykh http://tinyurl.com/3bxd97n http://tinyurl.com/4y5gmrn http://tinyurl.com/3s7lnwg http://tinyurl.com/3cbwvfq http://tinyurl.com/4xpfacx http://tinyurl.com/3bv9mrr http://tinyurl.com/3okruxq I want more than 4GB Ram just cause, but it seems like the next option is 8GB?	St
1.6.2	Do you think the build in graphics will handle 1080P movies well?	St
1.6.3	Thanks	Polite
