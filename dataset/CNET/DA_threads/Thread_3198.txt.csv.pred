1.1.1	Hi , I know what Tv tuner and graphics card do , but that 's about all .	St
1.1.2	I would like to use my computer ( Dell 5150 , has a couple of PCI slots ) to watch and record TV from cable and also HDTV droadcasts from the air .	St
1.1.3	Can you recommend a card - I know there are huge quality differences .	St
1.1.4	Specifiallly , will I get better value if I buy TV tuner and graphics cards separately or will there be problems ( such that the TV tuner card wont utilize the graphics card but will use the main processor ) ?	Ques
1.1.5	ALso is there any freesoftware you can recomend for viewing and recording TV prgrams .	St
1.1.6	Thanks a lot !	St
1.1.7	Jonni	St
1.2.1	I 've yet to see any from ATI to Hauppaugge in NTSC recordings .	St
1.2.2	HD recording is a contentious area with the HD providers not wanting such recorded and the hardware makers wanting to provide recording capability .	St
1.2.3	You may find recording HD limited to a lower quality and this is not driven by make/model .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	First thing to avoid initially is 3rd party software .	St
1.3.2	You 're far better sticking to the provided software that works with the hardware .	St
1.3.3	Once you get the hang of that , or find it has limitations ( who knows , it might well be perfect ) , you can look at other software .	St
1.3.4	As far as value and which is best : The all in one combo card often tends to be more problematic and complex software to install , as it 's a single device doing hugely complex stuff , however it 's a single device , so it tends to be slightly cheaper than two seperate cards .	St
1.3.5	The obvious downside is when you come to upgrade .	St
1.3.6	Just say you wanted faster graphics , but were quite happy with TV options ?	Ques
1.3.7	Both still have to go .	St
1.3.8	I also doubt for $ 120 , you could get any combo card with HDTV capability .	St
1.3.9	This is the strength of two cards .	St
1.3.10	Each can be changed , upgraded , or altered individually .	St
1.3.11	It 's a more flexible option , if not cheaper , and you can find loads of TV cards for around $ 120 some even have HDTV support !	St
1.3.12	You also have two cards to setup , which often means less of a gordian knot to install .	St
1.3.13	Now onto the problems .	St
1.3.14	You mention '' ... such that the TV tuner card wont utilize the graphics card but will use the main processor '' , but that is the usual way it 's done .	St
1.3.15	TV/tuners do not utilise the graphics card to any great degree , as basically the TV/video picture is overlaid onto a blue screen the graphics card shows ( it 's not doing much at all in other words ) , and the CPU does the rest .	St
1.3.16	However , the more expensive cards do tend to have video hardware acceleration built in ( nothing to do with the 2D/3D graphics card speed ) , which offloads part of the CPU drain for both watching , and especially when you begin to capture video .	St
1.3.17	The reason is that video capture is without a doubt the most strenuous thing a computer can do , especially High Definition .	St
1.3.18	CPU use cranks up , Hard Disks spin full speed trying to store huge gigabyte chunks of video and audio data .	St
1.3.19	It 's a massive strain .	St
1.3.20	So it 's best to look at TV cards which feature Hardware accelerated video input , and dedicated MPEG support for digital TV , and video capture .	St
1.3.21	Without these , the CPU has to work very hard , and HDTV support will need some hefty hardware acceleration by default , no matter what CPU you use !	St
1.3.22	As far as makes : Hauppauge Terratec Leadtek ( i 'm using 2 now ) Pinnacle AverMedia ATI ( I 've had 3 All In Wonder 's in the past ) All make well reviewed TV input cards .	St
1.3.23	Try specialised websites such as : http : //www.tv-cards.com/ http : //www.videohelp.com/ http : //dvr.about.com/ For more .	St
1.3.24	Good luck , GeeBee	Polite
1.4.1	Thanks !	St
1.4.2	W/o you pointing out I would not have relized that having separate TV tuner and video card is great if I ever need to upgrade only one .	St
1.4.3	Thanks also for the list of recommended brands and links .	St
1.4.4	Based on looking around at dealnews I found the following items that I ma thinking of buying : 1 .	St
1.4.5	VisionTek XTASY Radeon 9250 256MB PCI Video Card ( down to $ 40 at circuitc .	St
1.4.6	after rebates ) It seems to have some decoding support for video ( MPEG2 etc ) and has a DVI outlet so I can take advantage of my digital monitor 2.a Hauppauge WinTV-USB2 USB 2.0 TV Tuner ( down to $ 40 at circuitc .	St
1.4.7	after rebates ) .	St
1.4.8	But I do n't know if USB is harder for the CPU ?	Ques
1.4.9	OR 2.b Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150MCE PCI TV Card ( 65 ) OR 2.c K-World USB ATSC HDTV Tuner Box - KW-ATSC-310 ( for $ 50 at buy.com ) again , I do n't know if there is a down side to using USB port , but atleast I would have more PCI slots free if I need to get a better sound card than the integrated 7.1 Ihave to support the HDTV card .	St
1.4.10	Also , I do n't know about this brand Would be great to get any suggestions/comments ( from anyone ) Thanks alot !	St
1.5.1	I read your last reply and did n't see any HDTV card .	Polite
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	It 's K-World USB ATSC HDTV Tuner Box .	St
1.6.2	Please let me know if I am mistaken and that does n't do the same job as a HDTV card .	Sug
1.7.1	While K world is not a big name I 've used their video capture cards ( 8 port ) and find their software to not be polished .	St
1.7.2	It works but you may or may not find it to be as polished as you would like .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	These are snapstream 's list of compatible high-def tuner cards : http : //www.snapstream.com/products/beyondtv/hdtv-setup-center.asp # tunercard HDTV Tuner Card It is important to get an compatible HDTV/Digital ATSC tuner card .	St
1.8.2	To capture high-definition content with Beyond TV , your TV tuner card needs to support BDA drivers .	St
1.8.3	Ask your manufacturer if you are unsure if your card does .	St
1.8.4	Most BDA-compliant cards will work with Beyond TV .	St
1.8.5	We suggest the following HDTV tuner cards for use with Beyond TV : ADSTech InstantHDTV PCI ATI HDTV Wonder AverMedia AVerTVHD MCE A180 Dvico FusionHDTV3 Gold Dvico FusionHDTV5 Lite Dvico FusionHDTV5 Gold Plus Dvico FusionHDTV5 Gold USB Kworld ATSC-110 VBox Cat 's Eye DTA-151 VBox Cat 's Eye USB-A 3560 MyHD MDP-130 is a new card that seems to be generating some interest and is compatible with XP MCE and Snapstream .	St
1.8.6	Visit http : //www.avsforum.com/ since that 's a great place for posts on HDTV topics .	St
1.9.1	To confirm what others have said above , work on the two devices separately .	St
1.9.2	In fact , I do n't think there are any all-in-one cards which support HD at present .	St
1.9.3	Having recently gone through the home theater PC setup myself , I would suggest shopping for the PVR software first .	St
1.9.4	The free apps and those bundled with tuner cards are quite often lacking in features , so consider ease-of-use and other measures ; after all , this is the piece which will be most visible .	St
1.9.5	The solution which worked for me was the KWorld ATSC-110 ( about $ 99 ) - it came with an SE version of Snapstream Beyond TV , which I upgraded to a full version ( lifetime guide , etc . )	St
1.9.6	for another $ 50 .	St
1.9.7	This combination did n't require any heavy-duty video cards , just DirectX 9.0c compatibility .	St
1.9.8	You need at least a 1.7 GHz processor and *lots* of disk space - recorded HD consumes over 8GB/hr .	St
1.9.9	I really like the BTV app - it has a seamless guide for both broadcast and cable/satellite , and can be set up to tune the cable/sat receiver via IR or serial cable ( depending on the device ) .	St
1.9.10	Everything can be done with the mouse ( wireless optical is the way to go ) , which is even easier than a remote ( although that is supported , too ) .	St
1.9.11	If you wanted to add a second tuner in the future ( i.e .	St
1.9.12	to record two shows at once , or watch one show and record another ) , BTV can handle this .	St
1.9.13	You may have to be more selective about the tuner card , however , since only those with hardware MPEG-2 encoding are officially supported .	St
1.9.14	I might try this myself , but would need to confirm if the KWorld card meets this spec .	St

1.9.16	Good luck !	Polite
