Linkit, thanks for the link, that helps me in thinking about how to design it.
The metal bits I can remove from another case addresses the problem of mounting the mobo.
I have looked at ebay and did look through ALL the server cases.
I have tried xiode and zip zoom fly too.
Just not enough room.
I need 10 3.5'' bays for hard drives, and 4 for floppy drives (eei expansions) and 2 for CD ROMS.
I need it like that becuase eventually this 3700 AMD will be a relic but the mobo, with the ability to handle 10 hard drives, will be usefull for years to come.
With 10 400 GB hard drives, I could have a 4 TB server.
Thanks again linkit.
