thanks!
but money's not the problem.
i just want it to be portable and a snap to set up.
i once got such a thing for the wii nintendo system.
it's as small as a usb flash drive, you simply plug it into a computer that has a wired connection and it will broadcast that connection to become an access point.
but it only works for nintendo products.
