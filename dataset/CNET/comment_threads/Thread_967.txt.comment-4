Contrary to what the BB and Staples techs told me, you can print wireless without the expense of added equipment.
The tech yesterday told me it can be done and said I had it setup right, but was leaving out one step, the last one, choosing the network named printer rather than local.
If you go to Microsoft support and follow the instructions closely on setting up your network, it will work.
