I think I get the idea.
If I install the programs on the win 2000 computer I can copy the data for those programs from the second hd.
Next question!
If I leave the hd from the win ME computer in win 2000 computer will win 2000 be able to run those programs?
The ME hd would be a slave.
How much of win me could I delete from the hd?
