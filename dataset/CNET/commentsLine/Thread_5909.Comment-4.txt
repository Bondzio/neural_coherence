better than old laptops, i agree.
not faster.
current crop of netbooks (atom 270) to me feel no faster than my old xp laptop.
prob'ly everyone has a different threshold where they feel 'man this is taking forever' but netbooks are designed to ride close to that frustration threshold (while giving great portability, decent battery, cheap price).
