1.1.1	If you are running the recovery media creator , that is the standard for creating recovery media on the T6212 , and you get the message disk is not blank , give tech support a call 801-401-1419 , and ask them for a copy of the restore disks , and they will send them to you , this is a known issue with this software If you are trying to burn it in a DVD , and it finalizes for a long time , and apppears that is will never finish , you are right , it will not finish , this is another issue with the recovery process , the DVD actually has the image on it is finishes finalizing in less then 15 minutes , the system jsut does not leave a message saying that it is done , it has the restore image on it , but the program does not say taht it has .	St
1.1.2	If needed run a restore on the computer ( non-destructiive to prevent Data loss , to test the disk go ahead .	St
1.1.3	if you would like burn it with the CD 's included , it goes through fine on that .	St
1.1.4	If you have Audio problems while playing a CD , go to start- & gt ; control panel- & gt ; swtch to classic view ( left hand side of the screen ) - & gt ; system- & gt ; hardware- & gt ; device manager click on the plus sign next to IDE ata/atapi controller then right click on secondary IDE controller , then click on settings , and change it to DMA if available , this fixzes that problem If you are having trouble burning disks , right click on IDE ata/atapi controller , all three and then right click and select uninstall , if it asks to restart select no , if they do not disappear that is okay , once you have done that to all three , or more sometimes there are duplicates , restart the computer , it will load into windows , and go through the found new hardware , and then it will ask to restart again , and do that the computer will come up and everything should be fine now , if not call tech support and set up an order for a disk drive .
