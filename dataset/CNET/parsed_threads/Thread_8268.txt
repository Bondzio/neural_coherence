<s> I'm looking to pick up a netbook and I was wondering if anybody had any recommendations. </s>
<s> I'm just looking for something I can get on the internet with, maybe watch some streaming videos and other light duty things and has a good touchpad. </s>
<s> Ive been recommended the asus netbooks, but when I look on amazon there are so many different ones with similar &quot;names&quot; but a few different numbers after them and the price difference is usually large. </s>
<s> For instance: the ASUS Eee PC 1018P-PU37-BK vrs the Asus Eee 1018P-BBK804. </s>
<s> There is about a $150 difference between the two but i can quite figure out why.&lt;div&gt; Can anybody help me find a good netbook. </s>
<s> $350 give or take a little is about what id like to spend &lt;/div&gt; </s>
<s> For in the 229 buck range you head to target/walmart and you get the usual netbook. </s>

<s> If I can get a decent net book for $229 than that would be great. </s>
<s> Can you recommend one in particular? </s>
<s> I am looking for a small computer i can take with me to work when i have down time on the ambulance. </s>
<s> Ill mostly use it just to cruise the internet, apply to jobs, watch streaming video, etc. </s>
<s> I have a nice desk top computer that I use at home. </s>
<s> I guess I could look at laptops, do they make laptops that are the size of netbooks? </s>
<s> I really like the size and portability of the netbooks... are there any good laptops out there for $350 that you would recommend? </s>
<s> For the usual I'd get the 229 buck unit at Target and use it, pocket the bucks in savings. </s>
<s> As to 350 buck laptops you have to keep shopping to catch the sale to get the best deals but http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=LATITUDE-D631-PB-R&amp;cpc=RESX is so similar to my HP dv6910us that it's scary. </s>
<s> And I can write that XP in that system is really fast and usable. </s>
