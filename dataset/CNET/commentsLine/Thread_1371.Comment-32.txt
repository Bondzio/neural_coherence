this machine is a great buy, but i was put off when my local best buy discouraged me from buying.
they had an unusually high number of repairs to the hdd and i was the one who posted about that concern.
the socket 939 mobo will take an sata hdd, but it comes equipd with an ancient ata100 (ide) 2mb cache 160 gig drive!
why?!
price, of course.
when i check hdd prices there is only aout $20 difference between an ide drive and a sata drive.
logic says emachines would have used the sata.
it seems (a guess) that they must have had older drives in inventory and &quot;dumped&quot; them into this otherwise great for the money machine.
i am still going to buy one within the next month, but i am buying a maxtor 160gig sata drive to replace the ide drive.
the price of the t6212 plus the new hdd still beats anything else i have found:)
