i will restate what i said before.
never use usb / usb2 for *external* hard disk drive.
usb was created for mice, keyboards, printers, joysticks, *not* for mass storage.
usb will *destroy* hdd's due to its inefficiencies.
firewire and/or esata are safest way.
&quot;thunderbolt&quot; is a new connection designed for this purpose.
my only exception to usb is for &quot;usb flash&quot; drives.
the solid-state nature of flash drives can tolerate the inefficiencies of usb.
