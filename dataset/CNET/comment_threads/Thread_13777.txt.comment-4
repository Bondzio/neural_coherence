Yeah, I have been taking time to figure most of things out, but for some reason, the power supply and the power requirements have been the hardest things to figure out.
I'm not sure why... actually, its just that I cant find any sites that accurately say how much power the parts take up, and I can't find any sites that say anything more than the minimum power for 1 8800.
On NVidia.com actually, it says that the minimum power for 1 GeForce 8800 is a 400 watt power supply... but does that mean that two 8800s would need a 800 watt power supply?
Because on different forums, people seem to hint at the fact that they have two 8800s but don't even have an 800 watt power supply...
If possible, could any of you link me to a helpful site?
Thanks for your help so far.
