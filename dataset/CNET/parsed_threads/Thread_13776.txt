<s> Hi, recently I turned on my pc and found that it wont read the zip disk it had inserted. </s>
<s> I tried to put another blank zip disk and still no recognition of having a disk inserted. </s>
<s> I was told it may be because its dirty. </s>
<s> I was told to get a zip cleaning disk, but so far i havent seen one for sale. </s>
<s> Could you guys help me on this one? </s>
<s> by the way i got a pc with windows me. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help provided </s>
<s> The ZIP drive's head never makes contact with the media. </s>
<s> It flies above the media so cleaning is not the issue. </s>
<s> Try that media in another drive. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Most zip drives are approaching or have passed their designed lifespan. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advise. </s>
<s> Do u know if there is an new drive available that would read those disk? </s>
<s> We used dozens and dozens at the office so when we suspect one, we tried the media on another drive in the office. </s>
<s> Have a friend with a zip test the media for you. </s>
<s> If need be, decide to move off the zip. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice, guess i will try to move my data off the disk and look for a new media. </s>
<s> Guess its time to get a cd burner </s>
