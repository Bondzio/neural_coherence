if your keyboard stopped working, there are a few things you can check to troubleshoot what the problem might be.
depending on the situation, you can try one of the following factor:- first, if your keyboard stopped working, did it happen while you were typing or did you notice it right after starting the computer up and second, what kind of keyboard connection are you using?
is it a usb keyboard, is it a wireless keyboard or is it a regular ps/2 keyboard connection...
