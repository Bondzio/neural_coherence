i'd reset the bios settings and change what you needed to the time you set it up.
the 3gb is sadly less with xp.
even with that /3gb boot.ini switch i found very few apps that were compiled for that so we still get the usual 2.1 to 3.5gb used by the os and 2.0gb per app tops.
this is a sad story of an upgrade that should have been forgotten about.
how you can find your way back to the old setup.
