thanks for the reply.
i now understand how to ask a better question.
the pavilion 6746c trigem cognac board supports pio mode 3 and 4. so, does the 40gb hdd run at the 133 speed, or revert to the lower speed of the mother board ?
the history is interesting to me since i started clicking in the pc world in 2004 with a dell 2400. promise no longer sells the 133tx2.
the 6746c sold for $800 real money in y2k.
