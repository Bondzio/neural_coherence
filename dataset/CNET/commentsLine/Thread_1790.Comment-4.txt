thanks for the links, but i think you misunderstood my question.
i have the belkin card with its documentation and am quite familar with accessing their website for firmware/software, etc.. the parameters i'm trying to find are in the network connections portion of the win98se control panel.
there, under the belkin adaptor (not the belkin tcp/ip settings) properties/advanced tab, are many more parameters which can be (apparently???)
modified.
it is these parameters that i'm trying to get more information about.
thanks, harvey
