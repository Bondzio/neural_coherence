<s> Hello, I now have a 2010 Toyota Camry with a USB port. </s>
<s> I would like to connect an external hard drive to the USB port so that I can have access to all of my MP3s while in my car. </s>
<s> I know this USB connection will be fine for iPods that already have dichotomy software built in so I could easily navigate my library, but is this type of easy navigation possible when dealing with a hard drive? </s>
<s> Would I have to find some sort of sorting software to add to my drive that the car's system can read, or will my car's system just be able to identify the files as music files and sort them my name, artist, etc.? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for any help! </s>
<s> The iPod has a small computer in there so your USB hard drive is missing that. </s>
<s> Since replacing the brains of the iPod would overtax more than a few, why not go get a iPod? </s>
<s> As to your question. </s>
<s> No car I've seen uses the USB hard drive systems. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, While I too have never seen a hard drive hooked up, I have heard of people hooking flash drives up, and that would be the same concept. </s>
<s> The reason I would like to avoid an ipod is just because of the fact that you can get so much more storage for a great deal less of money, and if I can make it work I would like to. </s>
<s> The entire package. </s>
<s> Just like a car. </s>
<s> Now a car without an engine would be cheaper, could hold just as much stuff but can't go far (except downhill?) </s>
<s> Same idea about the USB hard drive. </s>
<s> About the usb memory sticks. </s>
<s> There is usually something that reads them. </s>
<s> What is that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok, bob, I don'k think you quite understood my post...I wasn't asking if I should buy just an iPod or an iPod and the software, and the usb drives i am talking about hearing people use are not connected to anything else but the usb slot. </s>
<s> Remember I'm reading your post and you write that an iPod works with your car. </s>
<s> I know systems that require the iPod for all the features you were asking for and if you want to try some USB hard drive my comments are why it usually fails. </s>
<s> No little computer to do the work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for your help, Bob. </s>
<s> I agree with Bob. </s>
<s> You need to have something which signals to the player. </s>
<s> Which can be an external drive case. </s>
<s> I use a thumb reader & slide an sdhc card in. </s>
<s> The stereo says that it can read FAT or FAT32 & up to 1000 files per directory. </s>
<s> What does the owner's manual say about your player? </s>
<s> Just to note, I did try plugging in an external drive for shi* & giggles, I got my 2.5&quot; (former laptop) drive to play. </s>
<s> It was in a case I got from Geeks for cheap. </s>
<s> It worked fine. </s>
<s> It was/is only 8 gigs in size & I didn't care if the data on there was erased. </s>
<s> My concern would be if there is enough power from your player to properly feed the drive, & where you are going to put the drive so it's protected (not just from thieves). </s>
<s> That is, bumps, OVER extreme internal car heat, & freezing etc. </s>
<s> The drives aren't made for that useage, laptop drives are ;}). </s>
<s> Good luck & I hope you come out of your car before the last song on a TB plays... </s>
<s> whew!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
