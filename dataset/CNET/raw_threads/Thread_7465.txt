Currently I have 512 DDR-SDRAM. I am looking to purchase either 1GiG or higher, Windows XP, SP1 (Earlier problems with SP2) Compaq, 1 year old or less. I have looked through a few websites and I am still not certain on compatibility. Could you please post the things i need to check and perhaps ways to check them so that I can easily and properly upgrade my computer. Also things that could be different but still compatible that could effect speed also post as my computer is mainly used for gaming. Another thing that I am worried about is my current memory problems and will they effect my upgrade. Currently my RAM seems to be running very slowly. I have used dxdiag and it tells me that i have 448mb of RAM, which is different then what it was whenever I had purchased it. I opened my PC and I unseated and reseated both sticks and it has no effect. I used a memory program, cpu-z which tells me I have 512. Is there a way that this could effect my upragde such as faulty seats for the memory or could I perhaps fix them now so I wont have to worry? Thank you for your posts

Such will not get any noticable speed boost with an additional 1G of RAM since the video can slow or pause the CPUs access to RAM. In this case a dedicated video card would help if you can actually disable the onboard video. Laptops and most i810 based boards can't do that. Bob

If not, you're then likely using some on-board video port whcih is using system ram for its own use. Doing the math, the missing ram is 64mb(+448mb), the amount loss from 512mb. That's good reason your gaming is poor as on-board video isn't as capable as add-on video cards. As for ram install, check the specs for what can be installed and way its installed via the support website or manual. I wouldn't leave out SP2, its worth the install besides security issues it does alot of 3rd party drivers, etc. Your best bet is to do a complete format and re-install of OS, doing all updates to include SP2. Expect a long install process anything else but that may cause SP2 to puke, its a hassle I know. good luck -----Willy

Well the reason I am not sure about this is becaues I had previously reinstalled my os and it didnt seem to be like this until i did so, for the first about nine or ten months I had the computer it ran fine, but after i reinstalled os it seemed to just have disappeared.
