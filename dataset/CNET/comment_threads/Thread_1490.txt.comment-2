You could add a Wireless Access Point -- but a used wireless router is a lot cheaper and ex-ISP models turn up all the time due to customer churn.
Obviously to replace the existing router you'll need to apply the right settings to match your ISP's requirements -- see their home site for any help files on how to set up common brands of router.
If you get a used ex-ISP wireless router and find it is locked to an ISP just add it as a WAP to the existing router --- see following link: http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101496.asp
