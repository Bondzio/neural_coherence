the firewalls on the other computers in the lan, and, xp accounts.
you also have to allow the other firewalls to let the network data through.
i am told, but i haven't tried this myself, that each xp computer on a network needs an account for the other computers; eg, if 3 users use one xp computer, so they should each have their own account names.
the same is true in a network that each computer needs an account on the others, but like i say, i have never done this myself, so i can't say that this is definitely so.
