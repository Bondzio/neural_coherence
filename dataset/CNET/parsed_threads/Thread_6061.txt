<s> XFX is an excellent brand, so if you want the 256MB go for it but 256MB was not a reference design by nVidia for the 6600GT (128MB, however, was) it doesn't meant it won't work, it just means the RAM has been added for marketing reasons, it won't provide a speed benefit due to the 6600GT's performance just consider, a 6600GT isn't slow, but it doesn't kill any game at 1600x1200, as in with all the settings maxed, the extra 128MB of RAM would help it if that were the case (extra RAM means more room for textures, and resolution data, it keeps it from off-loading to the AGP or PCIE buffer, but that doesn't happen that often) a card like the 6800GT has 256MB because: A) it's targeted as a top end part and B) it can make somewhat better use of it but in most tests comparing a 128MB card to a 256MB card, the performance increase (if it's using the same GPU) isn't noticeable such as the X600Pro 128MB vs the X600Pro 256MB the performance difference is like 1% if even </s>
<s> VIVO does stand for Video In/Video Out on the video card you normally have an S-Video output (either between the DVI-I and VGA, or to one side of both) with VIVO you need an adapter to plug into that, usually a small breakout box, but some OEM's just use a multi headed cable here is a 6600 with VIVO http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127164 and here is a 6600GT http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127150 </s>
