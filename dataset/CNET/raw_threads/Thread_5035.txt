Will be using this network for IP or network gaming 90% of the time. I have done research but there just seems to be something that I am missing. I have looked up the router (linksys wrt54-g)and a antenna (hg2415 2.4G). My buddy would buy the same thing on his side. What am I missing? What kind of hook ups do I need between the linksys router and the antenna? Thanks

The Linksys WRT54G does not has bridging fucntion. You'll need something like the Linksys Wireless-G Ethernet Bridge WET54G to connect two network together.

Wifi works on line of sight with minimal intervening solid material. Each time the radio signal goes through a wall or ceiling, it is degraded. The signal loss is also a function of the density and thickness of the wall - solid concrete is worse than a standard hollow interior partition wall. Some techs jokingly refer to wifi as a &quot;three wall solution,&quot; meaning you get three average walls or ceilings and then the signal is gone. You are shooting through a whole 'nother house before your signal gets where it is going. That's gonna be a problem unless you invest in the more expensive long-range (pre-N) stuff and high-gain directional antennas. Even then, you might start out in the yard. See if you can get the systems to find each other over that distance when there is unobstructed view (and I mean unobstructed - trees, shrubbery, and other vegetation are worse than buildings (because of the moisture content in the leaves)). When they are known to connect, start moving your equipment back indoors and see if you can make the connection again. dw

What would you suggest I start out with and would a 2.4 GHz 24 dBi High Performance Reflector Grid Wireless LAN Antenna($49.99)work for starters? If so what kind of connectors/adaptors would I need to hook up to the router or keep the bridge? I see the antenna comes with the N-female or N-male connectors, which one would I need and is there a converter box from the antenna so I could hook the RJ-45 into? Thanks.

Usage of an external antenna is uncommon in the mass market, so not all devices have an external antenna plug. Then determine from the technical specs what style of connector is required. dw

They all have websites with URLs of www.{just put the brand name here}.com. You can sometimes use the internet retailers, e.g., newegg, for a comprehensive list of currently-available equipment from all the major vendors. They often have a short blurb of technical specs about each product with a link to the manufacturer for more detailed specs. As I mentioned before, you are waaaay off the reservation with your desired configuration. I'm sure you could somehow get it to work, but it will take some experimentation and perhaps more than one attempt with different combinations of base unit and antenna. The Belkin Pre-N stuff is said to have better than average range. Whether enough to fit your situation I don't know. It is proprietary so you have to use compatible Belkin stuff on both ends, and a quick look at the Belkin site didn't come out and state unequivocably that this line of equipment has external antenna connectors if the internal ones don't quite get there. The new Linksys SRX MIMO stuff is getting a lot of press for high throughput and good range, but again it is a proprietary take-off from the standards and doesn't seem to provide for end-user adaptation of external antennas if the built-in ones aren't enough. On the other end of the standards-proprietary scale, some of the ordinary Linksys, Netgear, and D-Link models have a provision for an external antenna, but by themselves are plain ol' plain ol' nuttin special. Whether the external antenna would be enough to prevail in your situation can only be determined by experimentation. So in the end you have to decide how much financial resources you want to put into this until you find something that works - possibly even so far as mounting antennas on the outside of your houses to shoot over the yard or over the roof of the intervening house - but that adds complications of installation and safety (lightning grounding specifically!!!!). I don't have a ready-made solution, just ideas for you to pursue. Google is your friend. dw

If your houses were next door to eachother, I would recommend two Linksys routers (WRT54G and/or WRT54GS) using third party firmware that supports Wireless Distribution System (WDS). WDS allows you to use two wireless routers or access points to connect to eachother wirelessly. You will, however, lose about half of your throughput with each wireless jump.

Among the factors to consider is cost--two to three times as expensive. I'm not a network gamer, so I don't know what speeds will be acceptable to you. I have read where some people have connected to the WRT54GX from over 300 feet away, but I don't know what type of throughput they got.

Which can help him save about $45 a month on cable. I have a Linksys router with dual TNC antenntas and my bro has a PCI external SMA antenna. To make a long story short, I have tried the linksys Hi-gain antennas (recognized the signal but not strong enough), hawking 9dbi omnidirectional antennas (only got one for the router and on his end he had the hi gain linksys antenna, This didnt work), Then I bought some NetGear 19dbi Directional Antennas ( well that was a waste cuz they dont even work with linksys products), and lastly I have just received my package with 2 trendnet 14dbi directional antennas and 2 24ft long cables. I will try this configuration this weekend. Hopefully this will work (x fingers). Keep in mind that I still need a wireless connection in my house so I will be leaving one of the TNC antennas for my house and the other will be a directional antenna to be received by my brother with another directional antenna on his side. All in all I needed 2 Antennas, 2 Cables, a SMA to TNC jumper for the router and now I will see if this will work any magic. Total Cost about from tigerdirect.com $280. Not including the routers, pci card, cat5 cable to adjust my router where i want it and my time.
