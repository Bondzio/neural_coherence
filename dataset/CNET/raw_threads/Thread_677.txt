I want to play many video games which require Windows, but most of these games take up quite a bit of space so I do not want to run bootcamp on the Mac ss. Is it possible to take an external hard drive format the entire thing as a Windows 7 system and run this hard drive as an alternate with my computer for the use of video games? Also, I have USB 3.0 so it seems this would be the best connection for speed and price, am I right in thinking this? Thanks in advance

Also, is USB 3.0 a fast enough connection for playing games? Sorry for the remedial questions it has been a while since I have done stuff with computer games.

There are delays in loading maps, or the game but they do run. But then you have that gamer that won't accept any delay. Bob
