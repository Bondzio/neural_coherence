if you're by any local shops and/or office outlet stores, try a look and feel of those new offerings.
get your hands on one or several and see what to expect.
the plain truth for typical systems now is vista(the os) and the mac if you care for one.
but, no matter what you like, just be sure it fills your needs.
its going to be the same computer you had before just newer and obvious technology, being faster, stronger and capable(if you believe the hype) but again, just try to fit your needs.
if you care to, look online for what many maker's like dell, gateway, hp, etc.
offer at least on prices and the tech specs comparsion against maybe those you've checked locally.
good luck tada -----willy
