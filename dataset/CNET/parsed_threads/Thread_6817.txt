<s> Hi, I hope someone out there can help me with a problem I am having upgrading my computer with some extra ram. </s>
<s> The PC currently has two 512mb sticks and is running a bit slow, so I bought two 1gb sticks to help out. </s>
<s> When I put them all in and turned the PC on, the machine seemed to be booting up (lights, fans and what not) but the monitor was staying asleep. </s>
<s> I have tried the memory sticks in all manner of different combinations, as well as simply putting one of the new sticks in on its own, but with no luck. </s>
<s> I suspected that the new memory must be dodgy, so I tried some memory from another PC which I knwo works, but the same problem occurred... am I overlooking something obvious here? </s>
<s> The old memory: 2x 512mb DDR400 Ram (both manufactured by Crucial) The new memory: 2x 1gb DDR400 Ram (both manufactured by Samsung) The motherboard: GA-K8N Pro-SLI Hope I've given all the necessary info. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance Soundproof </s>

<s> does support 1gb. </s>
<s> ram but doesn't offer if high or low densiity types. </s>
<s> If you look at your ram modules, see if ram is populated on both sides or one. </s>
<s> It just doesn't work, its incompatible for wahtever reason. </s>
<s> Though you can fiddle with the bios area, use default or tweek it abit, save setting and try again. </s>
<s> In that vein, you may need to install older ram even to get into bios, reset, save, then shutdown and install new ram. </s>
<s> If none of this works, return ram. </s>
<s> Then specifically ask for ram that suppose to work in your system. </s>
<s> http://www.kingston.com or http://www.crucial.com offer far better offering that are 'suppose' to work in your system. </s>
<s> Last, you may have handled it wrong and caused 'static', ESD damage, ooops, it happens. </s>
