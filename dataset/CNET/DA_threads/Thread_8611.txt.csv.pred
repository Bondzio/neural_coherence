1.1.1	Ok , so today I was messing around with my iphone and I was trying to move all my third party apps to /private/var/Applications through terminal and I entered the commands that I read online and I must have done something wrong because it deleted all my apps .	St
1.1.2	Every single one of them .	St
1.1.3	Now I have an iPhone with a blank home screen .	St
1.1.4	I can see the dock but no applications .	St
1.1.5	Then , I tried to restore by putting my iPhone in restore mode and it stopped in the middle giving me error ( 2001 ) and I know have an iPhone with absolutely nothing on it ( the restore deleted all the other files ) in recovery mode .	St
1.1.6	Upon trying to exit recovery mode using iLiberty+ , it failed .	St
1.1.7	There is only one way to fix this .	St
1.1.8	I am asking for a huge favor , i guess , but does someone have a complete backup of a freshly restored iphones at default settngs .	St
1.1.9	( probably about 120MB ) that I can download and drag onto my iPhone to at least havethe files on there ( I would put them on using the file manager in iFuntastic which still is working ) Any help would be great !	St
1.1.10	! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.11	!	St
1.2.1	Do n't think you will have much success here with sorting this one out .	St
1.2.2	Worth a try though .	Sug
1.2.3	Have you thought of asking Apple ?	Ques
1.2.4	That phone must still be under warranty .	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	Hacking iPhones does void warranty .	St
1.3.2	I 've seen the signs at the Genius Bar too many times ...	St
1.3.3	But recently I think my local store moved theirs on a shelf behind the main desks there .	St
1.3.4	Anyway , sounds like the original poster bricked the iPhone in some way .	St
1.3.5	My thoughts : for regular , non-hacked iPhones/iPods , iTunes can make a backup of preferences , settings , etc. , should you allow that feature , but with hacked devices , I do not know .	St
1.3.6	Of course if the phone is stuck in some sort of recovery mode problem , that does not do any good , as I believe a recovery is needed before iTunes can prompt you with a & quot ; restore to latest backup & quot ; message .	St
1.3.7	To the original poster : See if re-downloading/installing the 1.1.4 firmware works .	St
1.3.8	Google for it and I 'm sure you 'll find it .	St
1.3.9	If you can use whatever program you used original to load it on there , this could work ... Having no real experience with this , I am merely guessing from what I 've heard though .	St
1.3.10	I 'm waiting for firmware 2.0 to get apps .	St
1.3.11	-BMF	St
