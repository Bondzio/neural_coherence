Connector for the bluetooth is the same connector on the bluetooth module, but not 8 pin. On the motherboard is a 6 pin connector, the same shape as on the module. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Does anyone know compatible cable connector? &lt;span&gt;Where we would it be bought? &lt;span&gt;The figures for the BT module connector. &lt;span&gt; http://ursic.net/pic_05.jpg &lt;span&gt; http://ursic.net/pic_06.jpg &lt;span&gt; http://ursic.net/pic_07.jpg &lt;span&gt; http://ursic.net/pic_08.jpg &lt;span&gt;

This may upset seasoned tinkerers of desktop PCs where you expected pin outs and more. That picture showed a connector that could be used for almost anything and in not a standard. Out of curiosity why was the unit taken apart? There are no user serviceable things inside. Bob
