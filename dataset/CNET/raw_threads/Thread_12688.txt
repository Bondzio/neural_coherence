I dont think its a problem with Seagates power saving mode but not 100% Additional info This hard drive is not just powered by the computer ,it had to be plugged into a power socket for power.It is Usb 3.0. I only really use this hard drive for watching films on my Tv and media box

It maybe treating the device attached as not being polled and thus times out. If the timeout period is always the same. This can be called &quot;sleep mode&quot; as well. Understand these newer TV's have alot of options now, so don't rule it out. This is on top of any other areas to check. tada -----Willy

I pretty sure that your media box and TV aren't USB 3.0 ready, it is the ext. HD that has to supply this for USB 2.0 status. On this regard, I think it fudges and finally winks out. In other words, it loses the link it requires or deems necessary. If you did *nothing* to prep the ext. HD for use and thus accepted as is, that maybe the crux of your problem. It may require once you eliminate everything else to allow either the media box or TV to format, or PC to format using the typical format command. As always, i still check the specs of all devices and see where they may differ or how it stands. So far, I don't see in the .docs how it relates to TV use, it's more geared to PC use. Afterall, even if compatible some issues still arise.

Check the fine print under last table. tada -----Willy
