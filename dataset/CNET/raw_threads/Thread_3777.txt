At the moment I'm looking at 2 machines, specs below: Machine 1 Intel Core i7 Processor 920 (2.66GHz, 8MB cache, 4.8GT/sec) Memory : 8192MB (4x1024,2x2048) 1067MHz DDR3 Dual Channel 500GB Serial ATA (7200RPM) 512 MB DDR2 ATI Radeon HD 4350 Machine 2 Intel Core2 Quad Processor Q8400 (4M Cache, 2.66 GHz, 1333 MHz FSB) Memory : 8192MB (4x1024,2x2048) 1067MHz DDR3 Dual Channel 1TB Serial ATA (7200RPM) 512MB ATI Radeon 4850 Graphics card Any suggestions on which one is better/more appropriate?

Proffitt	9/28/09 1:09 PM	1.25414334E12	The Core 2 is dead.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i5,2410.html covers this very well and you can look over the benchmarks and more. If the machines above had a make and model, I missed it. But as presented they looked more like gamer machines. Bob

But on the other hand if you are buying from a company than machine 2 is the way to go, you will keep the processor for a longer time than the i7 and the 1tb hardrive will last much longer. And the graphics card on machine two is a bit better than on machine 1. But you did not give us any prices so its hard to tell. might want to extend on that. Good luck &lt;&lt;&lt;NICK&gt;&gt;&gt;

Looking at sending about 600 to 700, so if anyone sees a machine better suited to what I'm after than feel free to let me know.
