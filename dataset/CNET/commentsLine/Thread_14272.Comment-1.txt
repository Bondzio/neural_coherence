i'm running a windows 98 on my home pc , and windows xp on the laptop.
now i'm seeing all these new flash drives with enchanced windows vista ready boost.
my question is, do i really need a flash drive with this feature, or should i just get a regular normal flash drive without this feature and the useless u3 feature as well.
also i know the u3 feature can be taken out, but can the ready boost feature be taken out as well?
i'm concerned if it will take up space for something that i won't use.
thanks very much :]
