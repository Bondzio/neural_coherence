I'm forced to open the PC case to swap PCI cards whenever I want to use 1394 instead of serial. What I need is a box (port replicator/replicator?) that plugs into the PC (USB2 port?) and offers a wide range of I/O ports like 1394, serial, parallel, USB2, SCSI etc... It would be nice for this box to sit alongside my monitor where the ports are handy. Is there anything like this out there?
