hey everyone, my friend just gave me a few computers that were having problems, and wanted me to make one out of them.
i decided to use the newest mobo, the gigabyte ga7kml (amibios) and realised is wouldnt boot.
no fans, nothing.
i changed the psu, and was happy to see the fans going (they were going full speed, no slowing down.
), but my satisfaction was short.
i quickly realised that no video was coming out through the vga port.
not only that, but three short beeps would come out only when i plugged in the monitor.
i decided to install a graphic card, to try to get an image appear on the monitor.
still, no video (but the beeping stopped).
i have tried three graphic cards but to no avail.
i tried swapping the ram with many other ram modules, still nothing.
there are few things i have yet to try.
1.
)resetting the cmos.
this one i'm not too sure how to do, but i'm sure the manual would tell me how.
2.
)disabling onboard graphics.
i looked in the manual and from what i know theres a way to do that by going into the bios, which i cant do.
infact i believe the mobo wont post at all.
3.
)swapping the psu.
i doubt its this, but it could be.
4.
)letting it run for about an hour, maybe letting it post i read somewhere that sometimes a computer takes ages to post, you just need to give it some time.
if i could get some help that'd be great.
