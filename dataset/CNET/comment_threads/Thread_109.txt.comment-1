This is perhaps a more general question than the title suggests.
I'm getting a new computer and already have another.
I only have one internet access point however.
I was wondering if it would be better to buy a laptop with Wi-Fi (where I have split access at home, plus good access during the week) or a new desktop with the intention of using a router.
Thanks in advance.
