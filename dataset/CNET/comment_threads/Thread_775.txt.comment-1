HI all I am looking to build a desktop and is currently examining the various CPUs.
I have opted to go with AMDs as they are, in general, cheaper than Intel's counter parts.
(by core counts, quad-core AMD is generally cheaper than quad-core Intel).
So I am looking through the AMDs and noticed the Phenom and Athlon family.
I was just wondering which family is better?
Thanks
