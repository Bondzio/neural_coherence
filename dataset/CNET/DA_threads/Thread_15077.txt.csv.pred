1.1.19	Hours on the phone and writing emails.	St
1.1.20	They even tried to offer me a mug as a good will gesture.	St
1.1.21	IN the end all I got out of them was a set of speakers and a mouse.	St
1.1.22	The most disgusting level of service and performance I have ever encountered.	St
1.2.1	buy a full machine on the net.	St
1.2.2	If it breaks or doesn't work, I want to look someone in the eye.	St
1.2.3	Piece parts, yes, I feel like I own stock.	St
1.2.4	But a machine, I want to take it to the store and shove it in someone's face.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Which brand or brands of desktop PC's would you consider to buy from a bricks and mortar store?	St
1.4.2	I'm looking to buy a basic desktop PC which I would use to do email; surf the web; some word processing as well as some Quicken.	St
1.4.3	I wouldn't be using such a PC to play games or to do videos.	St
1.4.4	If you wouldn't buy any PC from a bricks and mortar store would you purchase the necessary parts from an online store and build one instead?	St
1.4.5	Feedback would certainly be appreciated.	St
1.4.6	Big Steve 06/30/06	St
1.5.1	This'll be like a Ford vs. Chevy debate, but....	St
1.5.2	Stick with the &quot;big guys&quot; HP, Compaq (same co. now) or Sony.	St
1.5.3	Reasoning that they do have a well established support system in place and most anyone is familiar with their products.	St
1.5.4	Stay away from anyone's $400 PC's though, in my opinion anyway.	St
1.5.5	You'll maybe need 512MB of RAM, 100GB hard drive and not a high end CPU.	St
1.5.6	Something on the order of a Sempron 64 3200+.	St
1.5.7	In my opinion, again, Intel systems just don't cut it, AMD systems work faster.	St
1.5.8	I have had both and am using a self built and a Compaq pre-built, both with AMD's running things.	St
1.5.9	As for retailers, Walmart in my area usually has low prices, but NO in-storegeeks to help you.	St
1.5.10	Check Best Buy and Circuit City or Frye's if you are near one.	St
1.5.11	Good luck!	St
1.6.1	Pick a national store.	St
1.6.2	They all usually have in-store service.	St
1.7.1	Very good suggestions.	Polite
1.7.2	He may also want to check out Dell.	St
1.7.3	So-called computer purists nay argue against them, but you can't beat them for the money.	St
1.7.4	Deffinitely worth looking into for a basic PC that will be used for light home use, won't break the bank, and is backed by _great_ tech support.	St
1.7.5	Due to this great tech support, Dell has learned where they went wrong with their older computers and made them a hell of a lot more reliable.	St
1.7.6	Just my two cents.	St
