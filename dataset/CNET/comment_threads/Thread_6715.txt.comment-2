I want to have access to my network, specifically, my mass storage, from the internet without running through a computer...
Without running through a computer ?
What do you mean ?
''Access''+''Network''+''Mass Storage''+''Internet''.....points to COMPUTERS !
Solution: Setup your own mass storage Network in your own compound -that means computers, high capacity storage devices, backup systems, etc., And use Windows' Remote Access .
Employ the appropriate security measures.
