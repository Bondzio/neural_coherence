Remember I won't duplicate ideas you find at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Cannot+Load+Dos%22&btnG=Google+Search so given your new hardware can you tell what does load?
Also why would one format a drive before they tried to install Linux or Windows?
It's a great way to trip up an OS install.
Please tell.
