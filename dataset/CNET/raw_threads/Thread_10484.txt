I can use my browser to connect using &quot; ftp://10.0.0.50&quot; in the URL. I like it better than Microsoft &quot;File and Print sharing&quot;. It is all about preference. I find the MS protocols very chatty. This is ok on an ethernet switch with 100 Meg of full duplex bandwidth but i want my wireless only sending necessary traffic. SKrall
