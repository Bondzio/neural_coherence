can someone tell me what's involved in replacing a currupted bios chip on a motherboard?
is there any special tools that are needed.
i have a soyo kt333 dragon plus motherboard that i tried to update the bios on, and it has appeared to have failed.
i can't get my system to boot up.
i even tried resetting the bios using the reset jumper on the motherboard, but this did not work.
i have ordered a new bios chip from soyo.
i'm just wondering if this is something that i could probably do myself or if i'm going to need to take it to a professional to do.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
