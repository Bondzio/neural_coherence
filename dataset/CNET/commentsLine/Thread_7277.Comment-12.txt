it is a touch cd and it did open once but nothing after that.
the drive is good because it will load the cd in it which does me no good because it is the wrong cd.
there is no pinhole in which to stick a paper clip into.
this model does not come with one.
that was the first thing i looked for.
i took the cd drive out and still cannot get it out.
