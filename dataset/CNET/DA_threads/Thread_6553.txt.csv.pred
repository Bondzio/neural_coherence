1.1.1	So, my printer just went out on me, and I really became dependent on my all-in-one, but if I'm gonna put out the money on a new one I would love to get one that will print directly onto my cd's and dvd's.	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know of an all-in-one with disc printing?	St
1.2.1	Haven't seen one of those.	St
1.2.2	Printers print to paper.	St
1.2.3	There are new burners that will print to the CD.	St
1.3.1	Epson has three models I know of, ranging from $100 to about $400 (the latter also being a quality photo printer), but none of them are all-in-ones.	St
1.3.2	I know of no other paper/disk printers at this time.	St
1.3.3	You must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks, but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink.	St
1.3.4	Hope this helps Frank	St
