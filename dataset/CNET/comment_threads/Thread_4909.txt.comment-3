As Robert stated, the signal strength is weaken due to a &quot;multiple/broken link&quot; this effect is also found in extended cabling.
Either buy a &quot;high quality&quot; cable, gold tipped or adapters specificily offered/recommended by the vendor of your projector.
I'm not that into projector and stuff but found this issue with large monitors and ext.
cables.
