re: long footage: are you editing long-form projects?
(5-60 minutes?)
or do you simply have a lot of long take footage that you are having to sort through/whittle down?
or are you trying to render/transcode long clips into different codecs?
fyi - hard-drive speed (raid v.s single drive) and processor speed will have the greatest impact on your long times.
were you using the startup drive on you macbook as the editing cache/video storage drive?
(that would seriously make thing slow.)
