such systems tend to be build that handle any heat build-up be exhausted or radiated away.
the makers knows it maybe a problem and thus allow for better static cooling.
however, if the environment itself is a threat then consider a system where you can improve on cooling as the all-in-ones aren't that capable of a any cooling upgrades other than external.
so, if you buy one, best to use it in a/c cooled room and/or where cooling is in a comfort zone for the pc.
this is akk an opinion, as i see it.
