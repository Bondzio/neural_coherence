common sense says I have to side with Robert.
For an average Joe user like me (surfing, doing a little video stuffs, etc.
), vga should do just fine; I won't go out and spend big bucks for dvi hardwares.
But if hi-def video is your thing, then dvi will be needed.
So how's the new year been treating you so far?
Hopefully better than last year.
