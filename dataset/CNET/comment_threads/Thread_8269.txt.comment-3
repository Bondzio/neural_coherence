Thank you for taking the time to answer my honest question.
I am NOT anti-Apple, I simply have a vast and expen$ive support system of Sony items and love the Microsoft programs.
Every time that I see the iPad on TV, I covet it.
But I know that as soon as it's out of the box, I will regret the limiting nature for myself.
Being a Zune Pass holder, I've become used to the luxury of downloading 100's and 100's of songs for a flat monthly fee.
I'm fickle, musically, so I have NO desire to OWN the latest *pop* and hip-hop music that I exercise with; I want NEW each month to hold my interest and motivate me to keep fit.
I also have the original Sony e-Reader with 235 books that I paid for and don't want to lose; if Sony came out with an &quot;i-Tab&quot; (&lt;what the iPad SHOULD have been called), I could transfer all my books to that device plus use my Memory Sticks.
Well, I thank you for taking your time to answer me and not dismiss my curiosity.
Have a great, glitch-free day!
