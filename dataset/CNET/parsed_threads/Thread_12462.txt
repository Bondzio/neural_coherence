<s> What kind of speeds should I expect transferring files over a completely wireless network? </s>
<s> My speeds are usually about 0.5 MB/sec and no more than 1.5 MB/s. </s>
<s> This makes it impossible to stream movies, etc, over networked PC's. </s>
<s> A little about my setup: I have a Buffalo Wireless Router, 2 Desktop PC's and 1 Laptop PC. </s>
<s> The Buffalo wireless router supports B/G networks and all of my network cards support B/G. </s>
<s> My wireless receivers on the PC are Buffalo and Microsoft. </s>
<s> No piece of hardware is older than about 18 months. </s>
<s> All PC's run Windows XP. </s>
<s> I also have a NAS device hooked up to the Buffalo router via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> My max speed between the wireless PC's/Laptop to the NAS Device is very similar (no more than 1.5 MB/s with the average being about 0.5 MB/sec) I have tried various wireless channels, WEP Encryption, WPA encryption, no encryption, forcing &quot;G&quot; mode, Forcing &quot;B&quot; mode, Buffalo's default firmware, &quot;Tomato&quot;'s firmware, various MTU settings, signal boost mode, normal mode, factory default settings, etc I have also tried replacing some hardware and introduced a D-Link brand receiver and also tried my older Netgear MR814 Wireless Router. </s>
<s> None of these tests have resulted in faster speeds. </s>
<s> I do not have any wireless devices that should interfere with the wireless signal (cordless phone, etc) and have sat 2 inches away from the wireless router with my laptop to rule out interference from other devices\appliances, etc. </s>
<s> What really drives me nuts is I have seen speeds max out at ~ 10 MB / sec when downloading data straight from the internet using the same routers and PC's. </s>
<s> So is this the max? </s>
<s> What speeds should be possible while transferring between machines on a wireless LAN? </s>
<s> Why is this SO much slower than transferring files over the net?? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> When you use WIFI it's &quot;shared&quot; with everyone that is on the airwaves. </s>
<s> That's the first reason for it slowing down. </s>
<s> Not only you but those next door may be on your channel. </s>
<s> Next, it's only &quot;half duplex&quot; which cuts the speed again. </s>
<s> Finally you may be using some USB 1.1 port or you may have other bottlenecks. </s>
<s> I rarely see much past a few megabytes per second simply because the link speed is (pay close attention here) is all of 54 megabits a second. </s>
<s> That roughly translates to 5.4 megabytes and then it gets worse as we add &quot;packaging&quot;, the half duplex and more. </s>
<s> You should top out at about 1/2 or 2.x MB per second if everything was just right. </s>
<s> CNET had a nice article about networking and part of the lesson was to get wired what can be wired. </s>
