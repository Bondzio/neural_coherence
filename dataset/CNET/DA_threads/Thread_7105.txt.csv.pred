1.1.1	Emachines T4165 System Specs Type of system : Desktops/Servers Bus Architecture : PCI/AGP Hard Drive Bus : EIDE Native OS : Windows XP Home CPU Type : 1.6GHz Intel Pentium 4 Memory Specs Standard Memory : 256 MB ( removable ) Maximum Memory : 2 GB Memory Expansion : 2 sockets Memory Comments : PC100/PC133 SDRAM Modules It has a CD/RW and a DVD drive .	St
1.1.2	The graphics card is a nVidia TNT2 64mb.It also has a 60gb hard drive .	St
1.1.3	Thats my old comkputer .	St
1.1.4	It got fried so i assume it took out the motherboard and power supply .	St
1.1.5	I have $ 400 to spend on a new system and i could use parts from my old one , maybe the cd r/w , dvd drive , and hard drive .	St
1.1.6	So i would need a new motherboard , cpu , power supply , maybe case , more ram definately , and maybe a graphics card if there is n't built in graphics .	St
1.1.7	I prety much want the most for the money with it being upgradeable in the future .	St
1.1.8	Any help is very much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.9	I do n't think you are allowed to link places but if you want to send some specific links to parts and such you can email me at lxtrix @ gmail.com	St
1.2.1	for two systems .	St
1.2.2	Basically if you are stuck with that memory [ although you really do n't have much ] , There simply are no new mobos of any worth available for CPU'/chipset that still use that.. Really think that you should start with a new mid size ATX case .	St
1.2.3	For cost saving go to DDR , thus you really then have no choice but to go to a socket 939 and the best AMD 64 that you can afford .	St
1.2.4	All of the mobos for Intel P4 's , of any merit that are available will be for DDR2 You will want to run memory in Dual Channel so buy the DDR in pairs so that you can use Dual Channel .	St
1.2.5	Two 256 Mb sticks will show as 512 Mb regardless whether you are single or Dual Channel , however in Dual Channel mode the memory bandwidth is doubled .	St
1.2.6	If you can afford a pair of 512 DDR 40 [ PC3200 } that would make a nice system .	St
1.2.7	Check prices at Newegg , they even sell some Crucial and Mushkin memory sticks at lower price than Crucial or Mushkin .	St
1.2.8	They have a huge selection of cases .	St
1.2.9	Most mobos will have Dual Channel capability and have four memory slots and can take 4 GB [ however XP only will actually use 3 GB ]	St
1.3.1	The only thing you can salvage from that thing is the drives and the OS .	St
1.3.2	You 're pretty much look at getting a whole new computer ...	St
1.4.1	It died hard and even the CD drive and HDD died with it .	St
1.4.2	The only things I salvaged was the video card and case .	St
1.4.3	If you are going for a gamer that may not be doable for 400 US dollars .	St
1.4.4	I went to a store yesterday and found new computers with Vista installed that were under 600 US dollars .	St
1.4.5	If you just want email and word processor you may find it cheaper to buy a low cost computer than build .	St
1.4.6	So what are you after ?	Ques
1.4.7	By the way I found that a new case may be low priced till you see the shipping cost for it .	St
1.4.8	If the old computer had an ATX case you maybe able to recycle it .	St
1.4.9	30 dollar new case may have a 15 dollar shipping fee which may leave with only 355 dollars for other parts .	St
1.4.10	Hope this helps .	St
1.5.1	It would be nice if one live close to a store and able to pick it up in person .	St
1.5.2	I was able to assemble a system for about $ 360 ( excluding taxes ) .	St
1.5.3	This is at Mwave : mobo $ 56 cpu $ 80-131 ram $ 42-100 HDD $ 60 vid $ 40-140	St
