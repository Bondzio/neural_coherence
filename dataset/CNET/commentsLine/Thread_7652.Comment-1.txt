hey hey, &lt;div&gt;i just want to get quick advise.
i have an old computer with the following: &lt;div&gt;gigabyte ga p35 ds3 something like that 2,6 ghz core 2 duo intel xfx geforce 8800 gts 2gb memory &lt;/div&gt; to me it looks like the video card is the slowest part, so i thought i could replace the video card by maybe a gtx 260 or a gtx 460 or something like that.
what do you think?
ah, my goal is to have a few more fps in games and i don't want to spend the money on a complete new computer.
thanks already tobi &lt;/div&gt;
