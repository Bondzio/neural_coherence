I've had the same problem happen to me, but the pulsing lasts much longer, (generally would pulse all day and all night after shutdown if I didn't shut off the PS's power switch.)
I too had not changed the PC's configuration and checked to see if a cap had blown or if something else was amiss with the MoBo.
I found nothing.
I have an AMD 3200+ w/ a Soltek MoBo, 2GB of memory, two WD IDE HDs, NEC DVD/RW drive, ATI AGP graphics card, Soundblaster live PCI card and a USRobotics 56k modem card.
It has held it's own for several years now without an issue, until a month and a half ago when the pulsing started.
All diagnostics show there is no problem with the CPU or it's components.
The one thing you and I have in common is an Antec 350W PS (model:SL350S) which came standard with my Antec Solution Series SLK3700-BQE case.
After reading this thread, I'm going to follow through with my initial thought and replace the Power Supply and see if that fixes the problem.
I hope you have continued success after replacing your Antec 350W power supply which solved your problem.
