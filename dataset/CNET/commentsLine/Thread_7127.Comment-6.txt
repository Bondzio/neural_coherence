i decided to take them to the indian votech center & let them have some fun testing it.
i'm a member or the indian votech center.
would be some intresting testing on it for those young kids as long as they don't screw it up.
only cost me $5.00 to have it tested.
pretty sure it's the mobo at fault.
they merely test it for any faults & report back & i decide if i want them to fix it & i pay for the parts.
i most likely will reapir it myself.
