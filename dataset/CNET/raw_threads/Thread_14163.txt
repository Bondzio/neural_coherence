Sometimes I will be at the menu to start a server and it will vpu recover. Tried on other games, same problem. I have tried the following drivers, uninstalling the old one first: Catalyst 6.3 Catalyst 6.4 Catalyst 6.4 Beta X1800GTO Crossfire Remember that this is a fresh installation of windows and call of duty. It will never VPU recover when I am using an application or on the desktop, only 3D games. I have sent numerous error reports to ATI. Specs: Athlon 64 X2 3800+ @ 2.25GHz DFI RDX200-CF 2GB Corsair XMS Memory 250GB Seagate SATA1

Newer ATI cards will exhibit this behavior if they're not getting enough juice or if the power supply's +3.3V dips too low. If your motherboard/PC manufacturer provides hardware monitoring software, use it to determine the stability of your power supply. Everest ( http://www.lavalys.com/products/overview.php?pid=3&lang=en ) can display the hardware sensor info for most motherboards.

Specs: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817192008 I have used other video cards like the x1800xl and the x1800cfe, and they have worked perfectly using the same power supply. RMA'd the video card back to newegg.
