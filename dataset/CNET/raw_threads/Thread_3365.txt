I have 2 sticks of 512 in there and I am trying to add a third stick of 512. I can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also). BUT whenever I put in all 3 sticks of memory Windows XP will not start up. It keeps trying to start up over and over again. I cannot even get it to start up in safe mode. Does anyone know what might be the problem? Thanks in advance!!
