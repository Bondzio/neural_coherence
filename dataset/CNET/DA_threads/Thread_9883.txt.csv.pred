1.1.1	Can you recommend a product that I can install on my IBM Thinkpad that will automatically backup files and e-mails to an external drive whenever they are added or changed?	St
1.1.2	Thank-you!	St
1.1.3	XP SP2 and Office 2007 with 2GB RAM and 52GB storage.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	I've looked into possibly getting a CMS product for my laptop.	St
1.3.2	Comes with their software program plus the back up hardware is a drive in itself, copying &quot;everything&quot; I have on my computer including programs and not just data.	St
1.3.3	Priced at close to $200....My T43 is 80GB but could get the portable back up system sized at 80, 100 & 120 - 80GB about $176, 100 and 120 not too significantly higher in price.	St
1.3.4	I'm a realtor and need to have a complete reliance on &quot;no loss of my work&quot; which has been years saved on this laptop; I'm virtually unemployed if this system goes down or I cannot retrieve and use it 24/7!	St
1.3.5	Is there another recommendation you could make for a better product around the same price range, CMS already pricey; CMS though seems very reputable...three year warranty with technical help should I need any.	St
1.3.6	Their retail outlets charge a little less, but only a one year warranty and may not be too much above something refurbished.	St
1.3.7	CAN YOU SUGGEST ANOTHER PRODUCT EQUALLY AS GOOD, or a better alternative than CMS?	St
1.4.1	With an unit to be offsite when the floods hit or the burglary occur you don't have a real backup yet.	St
1.5.1	I can only afford so much as a realtor dying in this market; but this would be the only thing I would buy/use.	St
1.5.2	It's a sort of two in one: it's for backup and if my computer fails/crashes, as I said this is a drive I could use...I'm told it would be copied exactly as the one I'd be copying from.	St
1.5.3	I'm not worried about other elements for I work at home mostly using the laptop where it's safer conditions.	St
1.5.4	I'm really a novice with most of the technology and need all the advice I can get.	St
1.5.5	I found out today I can purchase the ABS 100GB for my 80GB LAPTOP at $187...no tax, no shipping and hopefully no headaches.	St
1.5.6	Is this a fair purchase WITH my circumstances?...like I said I wondered about other one's like La Cie and one that starts with a Western...sorry cannot think of the name; there are others but too much technology is confusing me.	St
1.5.7	I need baby steps!	St
1.6.1	For me, my &quot;work&quot; fits well on a single 1 dollar DVDRW disk.	St
1.6.2	Why not the cheap solution?	St
1.6.3	A single USB hard disk fails so many points in what we have defined backtup to be over the years that it's not a valid backup.	St
1.6.4	Nice fast copy but it fails the definition and will likely fail your written goals.	St
1.6.5	-&gt; Let's move to the dollar solution?	Sug
1.6.6	Bob	St
