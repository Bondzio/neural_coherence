I am attempting to connect through a Netgear WGT624 (v1) router and all i am getting is Acquiring Network Address, and then nothing. I am on XP Pro SP2. Any ideas of what may be causing this guys?

Turn everything back on and then try to connect. Everything is fine then. I usually have this problem after a power outage and/or surge, thank goodness for surge protectors. Rick

If not we look at testing at some hotspot which if that works we suspect the router (old firmware, dead, etc.) If the hotspot test fails we think about spyware damage. Of course my neighbor has the classic call. I asked him to push the button to turn the wifi on the laptop. Bob

I went through netgear's Smartwizard, and configured everything for the first time. It worked great for a few days, then all of a sudden it started dropping the connection and then reconnecting, now it won't even renew the ip. The router is still working just fine wired, and my computer recognizes the network on wireless, but refuses to Acquire the network address. Maybe just a setting somewhere?

Try the usual and hold the reset on the router (see the manual) and run the setup wizard again. However I'd test at a hotspot first so I know my PC is OK then the reset, wizard and if the laptop fails to connect in the same room, pack and return the router. I've already noted updating firmware so I won't repeat that. Bob

Thanks guys. I'll also look for a reset, but i have unplugged everything, given it time to reset, and plugged it back in, but same same. I'll update again once i hit a hotspot.
