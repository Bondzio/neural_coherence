what is the best way to set up a laptop with multiple lan's?
i need one set up with a static ip address.
can i designate a priority of which lan connection to use?
i know i can enable and disable the connections but thought there might be a better method.
the laptop uses windows 2000 over ethernet cabling for internet access and is sometimes removed from the internet and used to connect to an industrial printer with a cross over cable in a different location(different building).
the laptop is being shared for these two tasks.
thanks for your input mike
