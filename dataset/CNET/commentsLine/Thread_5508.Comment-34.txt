i've been through this enough to qualify at least as a skilled amateur and won't belabor the qualifications.
i've had two dead drives owned by friends that i gave up on after trying everything listed in these collected responses and returned them with apologies.
in one case after weeks, and the other after months, they both plugged the drives in as one final try and they fired up and both were able to recover all their data.
no explanation, no logic because when both drives were powered down, they never fired up again.
maybe it's the water, maybe the electricity, maybe sun spots.
so if you don't want to spend the money for a professional data recovery service, keep the drive around and try it occasionally and be prepared to capture the data on the wild chance that it does power up successfully.
