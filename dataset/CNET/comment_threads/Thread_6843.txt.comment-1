Can I put DDR2 1066 RAM into a motherboard that specifies &quot;1200 OC / 800&quot;?
Or does this just mean I should get 800 and I can overclock it up to 1200... or what?
I'm thinkin I can put the 1066's in there because one the reviewers says he did...
Sorry never built a computer before, still trying to figure this all out.
