is probably not going to work as there is nowhere to put the video signal from the Wii into the Laptop.
What &quot;might&quot; be possible is that you purchased a USB TV tuner for the laptop, plug the Wii to it and tune to whatever the Wii puts out.
If the Wii only puts out a finished video signal and not a TV signal, this will not work.
You may want to consider a cheap TV.
I'm sure there are Wii owners out there that will offer other suggestions though.
