the desktop (sony w700g all-in-one model) has the wireless pc card (t-mobile internet service) and the laptop has the wireless lan card built in.
i want to use the wireless service on the laptop without having to remove the card from the desktop.
what kind of router would i need to network the two computers?
thanks.
