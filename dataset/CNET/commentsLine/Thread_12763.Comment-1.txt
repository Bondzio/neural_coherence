last night i built a pc for the first time.
i think i was pretty methodical and made all the right connections.
when i turn on the computer, it seems like everything is fine.
it sees the graphics card, the cpu, the ram, and both hard drives.
the dvd drive and the keyboard both work.
the 4 case fans all come on.
the cpu fan and the power supply fan both come on.
the interior blue lights come on.
then, after about 40 seconds, it just shuts off.
no beeping, no error message... it just turns off.
it doesn't matter what it's doing at the time.
if i hit delete to go into the bios, while i'm in there it will just turn off.
or if i let it boot from the vista cd, it'll be on a screen with a progress bar saying &quot;windows is loading files&quot;, it will get about a third of the way through the progress bar, and then shut off.
my biggest concern is that everything seems to be working perfectly and then it shuts down, and i don't know how i will find the problem.
any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.
