dvi or hdmi different vid card(s).
dvi would give you video only, you would have to tap off for audio, hdmi would give you both.
your computer specs are a bit light, however and you would likely, unless you already have, need to upgrade the power supply, assuming this is a storebought puter.
plus 2gb of ram with vista will just get you by with 32 bit system try to run 3gb, if possible.
