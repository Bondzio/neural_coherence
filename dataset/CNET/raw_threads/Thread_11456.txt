You can usually hear it any were in the room it does not do it a lot but you can definitely hear it when it does. It is less than 6 months old, and there are 2 operating systems running on it. I runs really really fast.

Usually this question pops up as folk get a new PC. &quot;It sounds different.&quot; You can improve this with better mounting of the drive. I found years ago that putting a 3.5 inch drive in a plastic adapter to a 5.25 inch bay to really cut the noise levels. Bob

During intense operation it maybe slightly noisier. Take this all with a grain of salt, because sometimes what you really hear is the &quot;resonance&quot; that metal-to-metal contact makes when too tighten or loose mounting. This is common in desktop operation to have some noise. However, you gave &quot;NO DETAILS&quot; of your setup, so any answer could vary. If it now more noisier than when you 1st had it installed, then it maybe R/W to an area of the HD which allows more resonance to travel easier but it still falls into wear&tear of operation, expect some noise. Also, don't mistake HD for fan noise, that can happen too. tada -----Willy
