<s> hey guys need some help with organising a new computer system. </s>
<s> this is what I currently have (am leasing) Sony Vaio laptop, 2.66 P4, 512Mb Ram, 60 gig HD with 250gig external drive, external sony dvd-800U burner, 15&quot; lcd screen in the laptop. </s>
<s> I got it 2 years and 3 months ago, and its served me so well, minus a hard drive crash. </s>
<s> I will buy this one once the lease expires, and keep it for when Im on the road. </s>
<s> The lease expires in November and I hope to get a new system then. </s>
<s> I want a high end system, willing to spend $3000 AUD and source a monitor (looking at an apple 24&quot; cinema display). </s>
<s> Im a graphic designer and want a system that can also do video editing with ease. </s>
<s> I need to be able to run photoshop, indesign, illustrator and have multiple windows open without a problem. </s>
<s> something my current laptop is now having trouble doing... can you guys recommend a system? </s>
<s> I'd wait until November to to get a good answer to this question. </s>
<s> The notebook recommendation given today will be useless because there will be newer components in the market by then (mobile CPU's, video adapters, motherboard chipsets, &quot;Windows Vista-ready&quot; components, etc.). </s>
<s> Do you wish to purchase something now? </s>
<s> could use a memory boost... they all LOVE RAM. </s>
<s> add a 1GB stick (probably giving you 1.25GB) and you should see the Vaio really perk up. </s>
<s> also, copy as many data/work files from your laptop HD to the external HD, defrag, and set a fixed page file of about 1GB. </s>
<s> then copy your stuff back to the laptop HD. </s>
<s> that could speed you up also. </s>
<s> Seems the desktop would be better suited to the task. </s>
<s> not looking to purchase now, as stated the lease runs out in november so looking to buy then. </s>
<s> Cant wait. </s>
<s> Checked out some macs today they look awesome. </s>
<s> adding 1gig ram sounds good, know how to defrag but whats this about chaging the page file? </s>
<s> and you want to use it thereafter and beyond ... add more RAM (say 1 GB) now and enjoy it. </s>
<s> And if you CAN wait 'til January 07 for the new system ... you could get a dual core 64 bit CPU and Windows Vista..the MS 64 bit OS. </s>
<s> By then there's a good chance Adobe will have a 64 bit ver of Photoshop too. </s>
<s> And you won't need to spend $3K to get a well configured, robust, high performance system unless you go to the bleeding edge with the latest and greatest. </s>
