<s> I have a new dell laptop that I have been using wirelessly for the past 2 months. </s>
<s> All of the sudden, it's unable to find my wireless network or any other network for that matter. </s>
<s> It doesnt not detect any wireless networks when I usually detect mine and 2 or 3 neighbors. </s>
<s> I am using a linksys router. </s>
<s> Laptop has built in wireless card. </s>
<s> I ran the network wizard and wireless wizard on all computers. </s>
<s> Rebooted router, pc, latop and cable modem. </s>
<s> Refreshed connection. </s>
<s> System restore as well. </s>
<s> Laptop connects to the internet when using ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks, Nick </s>
<s> And it's under warranty, call it in. </s>
<s> While I might try a Wifi card that's asking you to have or obtain such and then install it proper. </s>
<s> Too much work. </s>
<s> Let Dell do it. </s>

<s> Hopefully it won't be a 2 hour phone call. </s>
<s> Also any idea why I constantly get the message &quot;work offline&quot; or &quot;connect&quot; when browsing the internet? </s>
<s> I get this on my hard wired PC and wirless laptop (when it's working of course). </s>
<s> It's obviously the router but why am I getting it? </s>
<s> Thanks, Nick </s>
<s> I thought the laptop was dead at all hotspots. </s>
<s> If not, tell a little longer story but beware there is no click here cure. </s>
<s> If the laptop is dead everywhere, system restore or drivers don't help I try a WIFI PC-Card. </s>
<s> Then I get the internal card replaced. </s>
<s> If the wifi card fails I reinstall the OS if I'm paid to do that since it's the faster fix and least cost. </s>

<s> Believe it or not, but browsers are not just for surfing the net! </s>
<s> Work offline allows you to use the browser locally on your HD. </s>
<s> You can turn this on or off under the file menu. </s>
<s> The laptop is dead at all hotspots so I will attempt a phone call with Dell this evening. </s>
<s> If they fix it, then I'm sure I will have the same problem again when surfing the net from my laptop or wired PC. </s>
<s> I get the windows popup that says &quot;work offline&quot; and &quot;connect or try again&quot;. </s>
<s> When i click connect or try again (cant remember which it is) internet surfing is resumed and everything is fine. </s>
<s> Then maybe 10 - 15 minutes go by, get the message again, click connect again and all is well again. </s>
<s> I have this problem on the laptop and PC. </s>
<s> The PC is working b/c its wired so I have this message happening daily. </s>
<s> When I connect my PC directly to the cable modem, I do not get this message. </s>
<s> Does your XP have SP2 and is it fully updated? </s>
<s> Do you have the latest wireless network adapter driver from support.dell.com? </s>
<s> What wireless utility do you use to connect to wireless access points/hotspots? </s>
<s> Your computer should have at least two such utilities. </s>
<s> Something like the following: 1. </s>
<s> Dell Wireless WLAN Card Utility 2. </s>
<s> Windows XP's &quot;Wireless Zero Configuration&quot; utility Open the Dell utility and find the checkbox that says something like &quot;Let this tool manage your wireless networks.&quot; Uncheck that box. </s>
<s> Click Apply and then OK. Now open your Network Connections window: Start &gt; Programs &gt; Connect to &gt; Show all connections Rt-click on your wireless connection and select &quot;View Available Wireless Networks.&quot; Any found? </s>
<s> Can you connect now? </s>
<s> I didn't have to call dell! </s>
<s> What a win! </s>
<s> I opened the utility and &quot;Let this tool manage your wireless networks&quot; was not checked but it said my radio antenna was off and to press Fn F2 to activate and it worked so thanks very much! </s>
