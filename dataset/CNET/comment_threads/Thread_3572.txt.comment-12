don't forget to get a tube of arctic silver thermal compound if needed?
Also, since you don't list a monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers/printer, then i assume you only need the computer and am looking for one that's around $1000?
If that's the case, suggest maybe a dual-core?
Unless you want to save for around $800 budget.
