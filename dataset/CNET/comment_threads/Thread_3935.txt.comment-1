I'd like to get a Nook HD - love the screen resolution and I do a lot of reading.
It seems to have less glare than the nexus 7&quot; tablet.
But, I can't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the Nook without doing it via computer.
When I'm on the road, I don't want to take the computer, I want to take the nook.
The Canon G1X camera uses a regular size SD card, and the Nook HD as a micro sD card reader.
The camera does have a/v out and hdmi, which I could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but I don't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so I could save them onto the nook.
The nook has a proprietary usb cable which I could hook into a card reader/adapter, but again, I don't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files.
Any suggestions?
thanks.
