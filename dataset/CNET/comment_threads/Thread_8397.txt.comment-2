You don't tell what browser you use (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, to name the 4 most common), so I can't be specific about HOW to do what you must do.
But I can tell you WHAT to do in your browser.
And that's setting the default folder to store the downloaded files to something else than the CD-drive.
Some people download everyting to the desktop.
Others prefer to have a dedicated folder on the hard disk.
It's your own choice.
But a CD-drive is rather unpractical indeed.
If I were you, I should change that setting.
