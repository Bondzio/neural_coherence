Like it has been said it depends on how big of change you is made.
Going from a P4 2.8 to a 3.0 probably wouldn't effect it.
Going from a P4 to a PD or more could.
Windows XP knows what your hardware is and when to big of change happens it doesn't like it.
Usually this has more to do with graphics, but the processor could be effective.
