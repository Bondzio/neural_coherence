i never solved this since it was 'bad drivers' for the wifi usb adapters i had.
instead we moved to another solution which involved waps and bridges.
in closing, your subject noted a plural adapters while your post noted a single adapter.
my reply is about more than one usb wifi adapter in a pc.
if you could clear up your subject title, that would be nice.
