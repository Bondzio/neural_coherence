As I understand home networks, there IS no main unit.
Just because your desktop is next to your router doesn't make it the main unit.
While our network now is 3 computers running XP, a short time ago we had Windows 98SE, Windows ME and Windows XP computers all connected.
On your laptop, when you run the XP disk to setup your network, it will offer you a chance to create a network setup disk to run on your &quot;main&quot; unit running Windows 98.
I think it even offers you a choice of using your XP CD to setup your network software on your other computer(s).
