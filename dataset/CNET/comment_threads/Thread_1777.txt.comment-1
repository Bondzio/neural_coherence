iMac/0S X 10.6.1/2.66 GHZ Core 2 Duo/4GB 1067MHZ DDR3/640GB HD/ For about 2 months my Epson CX5200 always prints regular horizontal red lines on every sheet of paper, spaced at 1/2 inch vertical intervals.
The horizontal length of these red lines varies, and is equal to the horizontal length of the printed matter on the page.
(ditto in landscape orientation, with the red lines vertical) The red line problem shows up in all cases, even when printing in grayscale.
Nozzle checks are clean and correct (except for the extra red lines) I've changed the magenta printer cartridge.
All cartridges are Epson OEM.
I've downloaded the latest Epson drivers for OS 10.6
