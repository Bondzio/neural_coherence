I cleared CMOS went into BIOS and set it to default BIOS then tried Default Setup.
Gene Smith from Award BIOS told me there is an update for Bios, but that BIOS for my 7 year old motherboard has nothing to control or monitor fans.
He said something about my motherboard having no sensors for fans.
Is there any way to test my power supply, or trace for a short on my motherboard?
Thanks for your input, -Joe
