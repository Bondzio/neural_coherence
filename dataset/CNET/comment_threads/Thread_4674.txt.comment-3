Willy, Thanks, all very good info.
I ordered a replacement specific to the GeForce FX5200 with a copper heatsink and 50,000 hr rated fan.
I had a choice of a bigger heatsink or heatsink/fan combo.
I'll try the fan combo again and see what happens.
I've extended the life of a few fans in the past using your method, though not quite as professionally done.
Its cheaper to replace when you can find them.
This one was an odd size, cut to fit the existing heatsink.
John
