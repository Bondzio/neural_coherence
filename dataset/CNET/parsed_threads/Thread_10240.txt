<s> I have been working for the past few days to get my XBOX 360 connected to XBOX Live via my computer's functioning internet connection. </s>
<s> because of how things are placed in my house, i cannot do a traditional xbox DSL modem/router connection and a PC to DSL modem/router connection. </s>
<s> My hardware i have to work with is my PC, with a wireless connection to my DSL modem, fully functioning. </s>
<s> It also has a wired LAN connection to a small router near my computer, not connected to the internet. </s>
<s> My XBOX 360 is also connected to this same router. </s>
<s> XBOX Media sharing works fine, but i want to route my internet connection from my computer to my XBOX. </s>
<s> Is there any way this can be acheived in this setup? </s>
<s> I have tried ICS, bridging connections, many things. </s>
<s> I am pretty network literate, but i dont know if i can do this and how to go about doing it. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> i am running Windows XP SP2 </s>
