i have a new hp pavilion a1510n with xp mce 2005. it has the built onto mother board sound (ac 97) with realtek drivers.
it sounds ok, but i have wondered if i would notice any real inprovement with installing a seperate sound card, or would that just be more money for negligible improvement?
thanks!
