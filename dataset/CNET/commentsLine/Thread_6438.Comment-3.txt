totally agree with james, logitech makes some really good stuff for computers, creative as well.
i use a logitech system and am well pleased plus they don't cost you an arm and a leg.
their other peripherals are also excellent, keyboards and mice, joysticks etc.
all of my peripherals on all systems are logitech.
