<s> Hi I have posted this message in the Mac Hardware fom as well, I was unsure which one would give me the fastest feedback.Do Macs only connect wirelessly to an Airport connection or base? </s>
<s> Or can Macs also wirelessly connect to any .11b/g signal? </s>
<s> Even if this signal was being broadcasted from lets say a Cisco or Linksys wifi access point? </s>
<s> Thanks to everyone in advance! </s>
<s> You can use your mac through most wired and wirless routers/access points. </s>
<s> They do not have to be apple branded, and most routers are b/g backwards compatible, meaning the new wireless N standard routers support wireless b and g. </s>
