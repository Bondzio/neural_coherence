hi, i work for a professional data recovery company and have a feeling that while you are copying your data, it may or may not be a success.
try to seek the help of a professional data recovery company who are experts in retrieving data out of corrupted drives.
most data recovery programs are not very expensive, and you could in fact have saved the cost of buying a new hard drive if you had sought help from people like us.
the cost of one our products is less than half of what you spent on the new drive.
anyway, there's still hope.
my comapny's website address is http://www.stellarinfo.com try it out once...
