<s> I've heard of computer with 8 or 12 GB of RAM. </s>
<s> But my motherboard supports only 4 GB max. </s>
<s> How do I make a computer with more RAM? </s>

<s> I find it to be just dandy for 99.99% of everyone's use. </s>
<s> Besides XP 32 bit will only let each app get to 2.0GB so why more? </s>

<s> I forgot to add that I intend to switch to a 64-bit system with Windows 7. </s>
<s> Hence the question about memory. </s>
<s> And I need that much memory for video editing & compositing. </s>
<s> So, how can I attain 8, 12 or 24 GB, as I've read some people have? </s>
<s> indicate a limitation of 4GB for that MB. </s>
<s> Might check to see if that's a limitation of the Intel G31/Intel ICH7 chipset....and therefore your MB. </s>
<s> MB specs show: &quot;4 x240-pin DIMM, Max. </s>
<s> 4 GB, DDR2 1066*/800/667 Non-ECC,Un-buffered Memory Dual Channel memory architecture *Support max. </s>
<s> 2 DIMM modules only for yellow DIMMs when over-clock to DDR2-1066 *When installing four DDR2 DIMM modules, install only single-sided memory modules. </s>
<s> *When installing total memory of 4GB capacity or more, WindowsR 32-bit operation system may only recognize less than 3GB. </s>
<s> Hence, a total installed memory of less than 3GB is recommended.&quot; If you truly need a system supporting that much more RAM, you'll probably need to switch to a new HW platform. </s>
