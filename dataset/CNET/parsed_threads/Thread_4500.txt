<s> I do not know much about ATI, so can you clear something up? </s>
<s> What is the difference between the ATI cards: the X 800, the X 1300, and the X 1600? </s>
<s> Hope you can help me with this. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The X1300 and the X1600 are newer cards than the X800, but from what I've seen the X1300 not necessarily faster in terms of gaming performance. </s>
<s> ...however, it was the high-end previous generation card. </s>
<s> The X1300/X1600 are current generation cards; the X1300 is the low-end card, and the X1600 is the mid-range card. </s>
<s> The high-end current generation cards are the X1800 and X1900. </s>
<s> You'll notice that the card names all have suffixes, such as the ATI Radeon X1900XTX. </s>
<s> I won't get too deep into the suffixes; I'll tell you that XT is better than pro, and GTO is better than GT. </s>
<s> I could also get into the CrossFire dual video card stuff, but I don't feel like it. </s>
<s> -Nathan </s>
<s> Thanks for clearing all that up. </s>
<s> I do know a bit about high end ATI cards, because I want to buy I new computer sometime soon. </s>
<s> I am also fairly knowedgable about Crossfire and stuff. </s>
<s> I was wondering, if I was to upgrade my AGP FX 5700 LE video card to something less than $200 tat plays Oblivion and other such games fairly well. </s>
<s> Would the X800, X1300, or the X1600 fit into that criteria well? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
<s> ...just save that money and put it into your new PC. </s>
<s> I'd suggest that you build the new PC. </s>
<s> If you want to play Oblivion, I'd recommend the X1800XT for $280ish on newegg. </s>
<s> But the X1800XT is a PCIe card, so get that with a new comptuer. </s>
<s> Thank you for the advice. </s>
<s> I am planning to get a new computer, but I would rather get a newer car (7900 GTX or 1900 XTX) or even SLId or Crossfired cards. </s>
<s> Anyway, if I was to upgrade my computer, which of these cards: X800, X1300, X1600 or any other AGP cards you think are good should I upgrade my computer with? </s>
<s> ...are PCIe cards. </s>
<s> What is your budget for the new AGP card? </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant that I would buy one of these new cards for the new computer. </s>
<s> I would rahter the card I buy be under $200, So I can make the new computer really good. </s>
<s> Any suggestions, such as the X800, X1300, or the X1600? </s>
<s> They obviously have to be AGP cards. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
