it's a small world and we (a company i do work for) have been asking more questions about bad sectors, smart and more.
here's the interesting part about ssd and what happens when it runs out of spare sectors.
to protect the contents of the drive the drive becomes read only.
smart move in my opinion.
but this means that anyone that setup raid 0 would need to see if the pair is readable in other oses since windows can't run from a read only drive.
as a test i'd boot ubuntu from cd in it's live cd mode so no install and see if it shows your files.
if it does you are likely safe for years from any trouble due to flash wear.
