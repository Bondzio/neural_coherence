<s> does &quot;core 2 duo&quot; mean that there are two 64bit Intel processors or does it just mean that there is one 64bit processor? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The Core 2 Duo is thoroughly documented out there but your question and answer is simply yes. </s>
<s> I thought however since you noted 64 bit I'd add this caveat. </s>
<s> The 64 bit feature is not in the Core Duo units (I won't double check which might have had it) but was solidly in the Core 2 Duo lineup. </s>
<s> Just check the feature list for EM64T in the CPU you are looking at. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It depends on who you ask. </s>
<s> The operating system will probably see it as two different processors when scheduling its tasks. </s>
<s> However, physically it's not two different processors since it goes in the same socket. </s>
<s> Also, I'm quite sure the cores share the same cache, and this is different if you have multiple physical CPUs. </s>
<s> Hope this was helpful </s>
<s> Thats its the same technology as that new memory. </s>
<s> Alternating current has an up wave and a down wave. </s>
<s> And the old memory just &quot;functioned&quot; on the up wave at say 100mhz. </s>
<s> So they found out they could double it by making the down wave a function too. </s>
<s> And thats why my layman's guess is. </s>
<s> That CPU technology just followed suit with the new memory technology. </s>
<s> And thats why the slower processor speeds (yet supposedly faster output). </s>
<s> The processor's working twice as hard appearing as 2 processors but is really one working on the up and down signals. </s>
<s> problems like piping. </s>
<s> A CPU gets bit strings a certain length (32 bit or 64 bit) which are divided up by the operating system. </s>
<s> Without the piping in this way, the data would just be garble. </s>
<s> Because each string needs a header, a body, and a footer to work (just like networking signals). </s>
<s> So if you have a 64 bit processor you're going to need a 64 bit operating system to make the 64 bit long strings with a header, a body, and footer. </s>
<s> Or does the &quot;Core 2&quot; make more vague the definition of what a 64 bit processor is (2 32 bit strings in parallel instead of one long 64 bit one)? </s>
<s> It seems to me that if you were going to make a multiple processored system, you'd separate the processors instead of piling them up on one another. </s>
<s> For cooling purposes and simplicity. </s>
<s> I don't know. </s>
<s> I'm just babbling. </s>
<s> I was drunk and in a bar in college when I did this, but on a napkin I wrote out some crazy equation involving the speed of light. </s>
<s> 186,000 miles per second. </s>
<s> And figured a processor the size of about 2 inches. </s>
<s> And what gigahertz it'd take to breach that 186,000 mile per second barrier. </s>
<s> And, don't ask me how because I'm sober now, but somehow I figured out the max processor speed to be somewhere around 3.7 gigahertz. </s>
<s> And you have to wonder: When do strange things happen in these processors? </s>
<s> Like power spikes and CPU farts. </s>
<s> And if thats not why the newer processors are slower. </s>
<s> CPU frequency is a poor value to use for computations, as the calculation speed is currently dominated by other factors... cache and bus speeds, etc... </s>
<s> The proper value to monitor is the number of operations per second known as &quot;flops.&quot; Supercomputers work on the scale of teraflops now-- petaflops will be running all around the world in ~5 years. </s>
<s> Still-- to correct your discussion, you're off by a few orders of magnitude. </s>
<s> The average distance the electrical signal needs to travel between junctions in the CPU is less than 500 microns (0.05 cm)-- call this D. Speed of light is C~ 3E10 cm/s. </s>
<s> Frequency can be approximated by C/D, which comes to half a teraHertz-- that is, ~500 GHz. </s>
<s> This is only limited by the circuitry sizes... in fact, there are prototype TeraHertz CPUs developed by places like Los Alamos National Labs. </s>
<s> As CPU developers begin to break the micron barrier with nanometer-scales for circuitry, we'll be able to up this petaHertz circuitry (i.e., 1,000,000 GHz)! </s>
<s> So, you're back of the envelope was probably a little clouded by that beer yeast-- hopefully it was good beer. </s>
<s> electrical conduction speeds are only ~2/3 the speed of light, so the limit is a little lower than my over-simplified estimate. </s>
<s> There are two processors on the same processor slot. </s>
<s> There are now processors with 4 processors in the same socket, but they are really 2 of the dual core processors on the same die. </s>
<s> Not for sure if they share the cache or not, haven't looked that close at them because of the price </s>
<s> It broke my: &quot;I don't know what I'm talking about&quot; barrier. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
