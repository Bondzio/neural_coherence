hi, i was working with my computer and suddenly it froze.
then after rebutting the monitor, its does not come up.
its stays black with a factory message stating that it has no problems and to check the cable connection.
i have unplugged, restarted from scratch several times with no luck.
i can hear the computer working and doing something but nothings comes up to the monitor.
i even have restarted with no other devices connected to my computer.
i have a gateway pc1500, xp, thanks... ...
