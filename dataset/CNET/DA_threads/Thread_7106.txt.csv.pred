1.1.1	I 'm considering purchasing a Dell 960 printer .	St
1.1.2	I believe that the printer is manufactured by Lexmark .	St
1.1.3	One thing that concerns me is that Dell says you must purchase the ink cartridges from Dell and the Lexmark cartridges will not work with this printer .	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know if that is true ?	Ques
1.1.5	I sure would like the option to purchase my ink cartridges locally .	St
1.2.1	It 's a pure marketing play .	St
1.2.2	Yes , I see the printers and they look , smell like Lexmarks .	St
1.2.3	But why go there ?	Ques
1.2.4	Very nice printers are under 99bucks locally without this issue to solve .	St
1.2.5	In fact , tell them to keep the printer if this is the issue .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	I hope you did n't buy the POC ... you 're stuck buying Dell branded-lexmark ink ... All the reliability studies by the major magazines put the Lexmark products at the bottom of the list .	St
1.3.2	You get what you pay for ... take a look at the value you might get from another manufacturer ... it truly depends what you 'd like to print and how much .	St
1.4.1	Lexmark does make the Dell model .	St
1.4.2	The whole difference is the mounting tab , in effect slightly different in order to interfere with using non-Dell labeled carts .	St
1.4.3	This is n't an uncommon practice , but why deal with it , just get the same looking Lexmark ptr .	St
1.4.4	model .	St
1.4.5	BTW , Lexmark tend to have more costly ink carts compared to other brands .	St
1.4.6	Believe me , shop around and get a different non-Dell ptr .	St
1.4.7	all those other ptrs .	St
1.4.8	will work , by heck , its your choice .	St
1.4.9	-- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I got the same answer from Dell about the A960 printer -- only Dell cartridges fit .	St
1.5.2	I did a search on dell printer cartridges and found a web site & quot ; HTTP : //www.4inkjet.com/dea9prsu.html & quot ; that identified that the printers are made by Lexmark , but they keyed the print cartridges differently for Dell .	St
1.5.3	Therefore only Dell cartridges will fit OR the 4inkjet.com claims to make a refill kit for that printer .	St
1.5.4	I plan to check CompUsa , Bestbuy , and Staples local stores .	St
1.5.5	I complained to the salesperson who could care less about my complaint .	St
1.5.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.6.1	i have refilled these cartridges without a problem with a kit i got from printpal.com or 77colors.com ( sorry i ca n't remember which ) .	St
1.6.2	but it is the only affordable way to deal with this printer .	St
1.7.1	the dell printer have a little tab that prevent the ink holder from locking with a lexmark cartridge .	St
1.7.2	I cut off the tab and I am running with a lexmark cartridge just fine .	St
1.7.3	Its stupid cos the cartridges are all the same price ( 40 dollars CDN ) ... what a rip off ... I am going to refill it .	St
1.7.4	They give you a good price on the printer but buy a couple of cartridges and you might as well have gone with something better .	St
1.7.5	My real problem is : The A960 I cant use as a standalone fax ... some faxes just are completely received by the other side although the machine tells me its okay DELL SUX - LEXMARK SUX -- - all a money grab -- - no quality	St
