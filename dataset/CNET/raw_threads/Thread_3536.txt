I bought a Xonar DG after reading a lot of reviews, installed it, hooked into my 4.1 system, and everything worked great and sound great. But I normally change back and forth between speakers and headphones for late night. The Dell case has a proprietary front panel with a 10-pin straight line connector to a small board in the front panel. The Xonar has a 9-pin headphone out, but now it's a bridge to nowhere. I tried one of the typical 9-pin connectors with the screws on the side but it didn't fit. Is it possible to (if I can find the right connector) just run a line to the 9-pin out to the front of the case with a 3.5 stereo female for the headphones? Unfortunately, to plug the headphones into the back of the card, it is necessary to unplug the speakers. Nowhere on the Xonar box is there a comment saying it's either/or, but such seems to be the situation. Any suggestions short of putting my headphone away for good?
