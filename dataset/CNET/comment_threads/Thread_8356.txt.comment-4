networking Windows 98 and up.
In the case of firewalls, Zone Alarm can work even when disabled.
An uninstall is sometimes needed.
After I check workgroup names, IP and subnet addresses, enable file and print sharing, set some folder to share, and the network PC is still not shown, I will do a Search for the PC using XP's Search feature.
If the name does not work, I try the IP address.
