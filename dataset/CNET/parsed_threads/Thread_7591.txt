<s> Hi, I need to controll 2 computers by one set of keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> I do NOT need a KVM switch. </s>
<s> I need a USB switch that will keep the first KM connection active even when I am connecting to the second computer so that when I connect back to the first it would not give me the &quot;HUD&quot; pop-ups each time. </s>
<s> Any idea what I could use? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Best of luck in your search. </s>

<s> What you probably need is a manual KVM switch, not an automatic switch. </s>
<s> A manual switch keeps a load on the ports at all times so the pc doesn't realize that the keyboard and mouse aren't connected. </s>
<s> We use a manual switch in our shop to connect up to four PC's to the same keyboard, mouse and display and haven't had any problems. </s>
<s> An automatic switch caused many problems, but the manual one doesn't. </s>
