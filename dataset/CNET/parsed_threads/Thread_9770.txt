<s> I recently purchased a PNY attache 128 mb jump drive and it works on every computer that I can find except my primary work computer. </s>
<s> That computer is running XP Pro and it is a Dell. </s>
<s> The funny thing is....that it works on that computer under my coworkers usernames, just not mine. </s>
<s> It recognizes the drive (a message pops up saying that the USB port is not high-speed), but when I go to my computer, the drive is not listed. </s>
<s> Are there settings that I can change? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Norton's scanning of removable media has been cited for doing this. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> TWEAKUI could be hiding the drive letter. </s>

<s> what is TWEAKUI? </s>
<s> is that a setting that I can turn off or something? </s>
<s> Since Norton implemented this, my bet is some other antivirus will soon and trip over the same issue. </s>
<s> You have to &quot;pitch in&quot; on this discussion and not only supply the &quot;we dont have norton...&quot;, but tell what you have. </s>
<s> You can imagine we only have 20 questions to use and then I have to give up what you do have. </s>
<s> Please help the forum help you out. </s>
<s> As to TWEAKUI. </s>
<s> Please look it up on Google.com and look at the Drives tab to see if it's unchecked. </s>
