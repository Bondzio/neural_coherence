Hi all.
I would like some opinions to settle a debate I am having with my brother.
I have an AMD Phenom II x2, Black edition 3.1ghz, my brother has the Phenom II x4 965 3.4ghz.
I am happy with the CPU but he insists that upgrading to a 965 quad core would improveeverything!
From all the info.
I have read on numerous tech sites the only real advantage to having multiple cores is more efficient multi-tasking.
I rarely have more than a game running, web browser and maybe Word at the same time and I switch between these without a problem.
Apart from the speed increase is there a really good reason why I should upgrade my CPU?
If I see any good reason to upgrade I am more than willing to do it.
