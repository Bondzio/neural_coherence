Hey All, I'm in the process of upgrading my Dell PC and I have a couple questions about compatability.
I had hoped to buy Asus's new SLI capable motherboard to run two Nvidia 6800 OC PCI express cards.
I also have an upgraded power supply.
What else to I need to purchase in order to get my system up and running?
Thanks, M. Walsh
