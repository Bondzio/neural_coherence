<s> I think that the satas are the fastest.... but wich model? </s>
<s> and I have an NVIDIA nforce Network adapter, can I get one that makes my internet faster? </s>
<s> you already have a 500gb sata 7200rpm drive so it's a fast hard drive. </s>
<s> a 10,000rpm drive is technically faster but won't help most apps. </s>
<s> if you're creating multi-gigabyte video files, a 10k drive may help a bit, but otherwise you won't notice the overall difference. </s>
<s> run the speed test and tweak test at http://www.dslreports.com/tools to make sure you're getting the broadband speed you're paying for and to tune your connection. </s>
<s> Is 10,000 the highest It can go? </s>
