I recall something about the 875 including what is called PAT technology which is supposed to provide a small performance gain. Some MB manufacturers such as ASUS, are said to have unlocked it in some of their 865s. I believe Intel calls the 875 their &quot;Canterwood&quot; and the 865 the &quot;Springdale&quot;. I've read there is little performance difference, however. Some say the 865s are a better value. Most will now support the Intel Prescott CPUs.
