this laptop is toshiba satellite a505, runs win7 x64 home premium with 4gb ram.
i do all maintenance by myself.
i have heard of cleaning air vent using air cans but honestly i am too scared too do that as i am afraid that instead of getting the dust out, i will block it even further by pushing it in.
may be i just need to know how to do it correctly.
