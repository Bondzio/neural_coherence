perhaps a hobby, part time artist is short on cash most of the time.
but digital artists working in movies,tv,video games, advertising, web design can earn quite a nice chunk of change.
we artists are all not moody, dark, depressing ,broke and wear black all the time.
good artists don't blame tools, because tools are just that...tools, talent and hard work make something exceptional.
the computer is just a very, very fancy pencil, its what you can do with it, not what it is that matters.
