<s> So lately my G4 iBook has been a little weird.... </s>
<s> However, it will no longer recognizes my battery anymore. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to fix this with out shelling out tons of cash. </s>
<s> Hope someone has any ideas. </s>
<s> Batteries don't last but a few years. </s>
<s> How old is that battery? </s>
<s> Try a friends (working) battery if you can't bring yourself to buy a new battery. </s>

<s> Start here and do the appropriate updates if you need to, here: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106704 Then, I found these without trying very hard at all: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=667430&tstart=30 http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449 https://support.apple.com/ibook_powerbook/batteryexchange/? </s>
<s> I hope this helps... let us know how this saga ends... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You didn't answer the questions but that's your choice. </s>
<s> Do check the contacts since I ran into a few broken ones. </s>
<s> Also, read the other reply. </s>
<s> One real nasty of a failed older battery is that it can destroy the charging circuit. </s>
<s> This is not a design flaw. </s>
<s> Sadly the only fix for that is a new board. </s>

<s> So the &quot;saga&quot; ends. </s>
<s> I sit here infront of my G4, which I think it has a mind of its own, and the battery shows 3:21 98%. </s>
<s> The best part about this little fiasco, I did absolutly nothin. </s>
<s> So thank you to all those who helped... -Andrew </s>
<s> But consider checking those apple.com links... if for nothing else, at least know that they have some good information there and some pretty lively discussion threads. </s>
<s> If there is one area that continues to show here is the contacts. </s>
<s> Even removing and replacing the battery a few times would &quot;scrub&quot; the contacts and magically fix it. </s>
<s> Think about this if it fails again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> can help, too - but be sure no eraser pieces are left on the contacts... </s>
