ordered a giga-byte ga-ma78gm-sh2 rev 1 motherboard from ewiz.
also a kit of kingston hyperx memory.
arrived and i hooked to a logisys 575w psu, both the 24 pin and the cpu's 4pin.
cpu installed is amd 64x2 athlon 4200, using hsf from &quot;amd processor in a box&quot;.
memory is khx6400d2llk2/2g which datasheet says initially boots by spd to 1.8v at 667mhz cl5 and then can be adjusted later in bios to overclock to 2.0v at 800mhz cl4.
has onboard video.
benchtest is with cpu/hsf, memory both sticks, psu hooked to 24 and 4 pin plugs on mobo, keyboard to ps/2, monitor to onboard vga at rear of mobo.
cpu fan runs, psu fans run, dc meter shows voltage at drive plugs ok, even added case fan to other mobo plug works, but no vga.
number lock key on keyboard can't be turned off.
file rma with ewiz and still waiting for a number from them.
meanwhile the same day order cheap golden ram pc5300 cl5 ddr2 memory from geeks along with a cheap 8mb vga card for pci slot.
it arrives and i test the new memory on the mobo and still no vga from onboard plug.
i add in the pci card and short cmos pins again as between each new test, hook to vga plug on card and no video.
do couple restarts that way, no video.
each time fans on psu and cpu run fine, and the power pins will do a 4 second delay and shutdown too, but no video and not able to turn off number lock on keyboard at any time.
my opinion is the board is toast, no good, maybe was already rma'ed to them from someone who burnt or screwed the bios trying to update it since there are newer updates for the bios.
any other opinions or thoughts on what i can try before i get an rma number from ewiz (assuming i do after my reminder note i sent them today)?
