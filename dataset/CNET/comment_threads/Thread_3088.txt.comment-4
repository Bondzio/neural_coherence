Check Dell's suppport website for any FAQ's or details that direct you to frequent problems.
It maybe a known problem with a cure.
I suggest for now to &quot;turn-off&quot; stand-by and see if that alone rids the problem.
Then proceed to what if any cures are provided by Dell.
If none, check MS knowledge base for again any problems associated with CD drives.
You can google away and see what responds as well.
More often than not, someone has already experienced your problem and provided the solution to install or guide you through it.
