<s> I need help.Just purchased a new Netgear wireless router which came with no cd and I am unable to download the firmware.The message that I get is that fragments were downloaded and it may hurt by system.Purchased from Amazon and there was no indication that this would not be provided, Just purchased a dell laptop.My OS is windows xp and I have comcast internet service. </s>
<s> I am in desperate need of help.I tried for hours with no success. </s>
<s> Can someone let me know where I can go in order to download the firmware. </s>
<s> I understand that all settings should be automatic but I do know that I need the firmware since there was no dics provided.I was able to get the instruction manual but without the firmware, I cannot do anything. </s>
<s> Netgear was not helpful to me because this was a refurbished item. </s>
<s> None of this was relayed to me during my purchase. </s>

<s> Firmware installs to memory in the router, not your computer. </s>
<s> The router already has a version installed, and you don't need to download and install anything if it already has the latest version. </s>
<s> All the routers I have seen NEVER come with a firmware disc because a firmware version is already installed in the router AT THE FACTORY. </s>
<s> If the router doesn't have the latest firmware version (you need to read the manual to discover how to check this), then download it using a computer and Internet connection that works properly. </s>
<s> IMPORTANT: After you download the latest version, follow the instructions on the webpage or in the manual to install the firmware update. </s>
<s> If you don't read and follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are written, then you risk turning your router into an expensive doorstop. </s>
<s> Please read the instructions. </s>
<s> * * * * * I had absolutely no trouble downloading the latest version today. </s>
<s> Version &quot;2.0.13_1.0.13&quot; for North America Version &quot;2.0.14_1.0.14&quot; for Worldwide - outside North America Download the one that is appropriate for where you live. </s>
<s> Get firmware here (Left side of your screen): http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v6.asp </s>
<s> Thanks for your response.When I go to the netgear website and try to download it the message that I get says &quot;recovered file fragment&quot;.I am not very good when it comes to this.I can follow directions but am so confused. </s>
<s> Can you give me step by step directions in order to do this.The Amazon store is not getting back to me. </s>
<s> I need this new laptop because I am bed-ridden and can not use my desktop computer as often as I need to. </s>
<s> I am so sorry and would appreciate any help that I could get.I have already been to the links that you provided me. </s>
<s> That's when I get the message about the recovered file fragments. </s>
<s> I have a surfboard modem from comcast and a Linksys router because I have Tivo connected thru my internet. </s>
<s> I do know that I need to only use the Netgear router and forget about the Linksys router. </s>
