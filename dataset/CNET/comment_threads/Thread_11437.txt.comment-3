The computer that has the 2 lan ports is halfway between the dsl modem and the second computer and I have a cable long enough to reach the second computer.
The computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable.
The dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house, running a cable would not be easy so I thought maybe with equipment I have I could cheat and make it easy.
Oh well, just a thought.
Thanks very much Sean
