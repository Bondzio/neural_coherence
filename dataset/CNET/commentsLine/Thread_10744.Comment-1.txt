using a windowxp pro os... with plenty of ram stick with onboard audio and a soundblaster pci card... now is it possible to use two soundcards at once.. now the reason im asking is because i have two separate inputs specifically for mic..i'd like to record simultaneously... guitar and voice.... now ive tried the splitter and it really degrades the signal... as we know with a splitter we get half the channel... by the way i am using a soundblaster live 5.1 ... with line in mic in headphone and line out ... any ideas ?
thankyou kindly
