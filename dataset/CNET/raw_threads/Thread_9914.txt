After total system falure,(dvd-rw drives fail to burn dvd-r's, gfx card is pixelated and burned out, mobo won't boot with slave drive) it's time for an upgrade. I haven't been keeping up with new hardware lately. What would be some comparable parts for a new build? Seems like C2D and 9600GTs are the way to go, but I still have no clue. These are my specs: AMD Opteron @ 2.2GHz Dual Core 2 GB Corsair XMS DDR 450 ASUS A8N SLI-X16 36.6 GB WD SATA 3.0GB/S 10k RPM 250 GB WD Caviar SATA 3.0GB/S Nvidia 7900 GTOC

(if games, include your screen res that you play at.) the last post of this thread has a $600 budget build (last post): http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=304263&messageID=2831159 here's a $1000 higher-end build that re-uses your case and hard drives. (considering the failures you mentioned, the power supply should be tossed.) cpu: intel core2quad q9550, 2.8ghz, 12mb,
