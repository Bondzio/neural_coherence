1.1.1	Sorry but after discussion with my fellow Mods I deleted your post.	St
1.1.2	You offered a method to circumvent Microsoft's licensing, and that is not permitted in these forums.	St

1.2.1	Okay, sorry Mark, should have read the rules...	Polite
1.2.2	I was meaning to use this just as a way to restore Windows, as I already have a valid Microsoft license for the computer, but had no way to re-format the machine.	St
1.2.3	I can see though that some people would use this for illegal purposes, however, as doing the mod would allow the disks to work on any machine, and therefore use the same Product Keys.	St
1.2.4	Anyway when I re-started Windows I got a Code Purple error because the tattoo on the Motherboard did not match the one on the hard disk, so I just reformatted and installed Ubuntu Linux 10.10 just to play it safe.	St
1.2.5	Thanks, ttcole1254	St
