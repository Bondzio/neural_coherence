<s> I've been reading a lot and there is a lot of discussion about what power supply is required to power various components. </s>
<s> Can somebody tell me whether the power supply draws power at its rated wattage or whether that is just the maximum and the power used depends on the components. </s>
<s> For example, if you have a case that comes supplied with a 430W PSU, but you only need (say) a 300W supply to power your components, will you be using more electricity than if you got a 300W PSU, or just the same? </s>
<s> While the efficiency of the power supply may play a role in actual power being used, the power consumed will depend on the components that you have installed and what you are doing with them. </s>
<s> A power supply rating of 500w versus one rated at 300w is usually a representative of the capability not what it is using. </s>
<s> If you are thinking that a smaller rating will save you electricity, then you are looking at the wrong place. </s>
<s> In order to save on the power being used, you need to remove components that you are not using (NOT recommended). </s>
<s> Do not worry about it. </s>
<s> Changing computers internals to save energy is not an acceptable practice by most. </s>
<s> Thanks - I am looking at putting a computer together. </s>
<s> It will only be relatively low-power, but different cases come with different PSU's supplied. </s>
<s> I didn't want to get one with a higher capacity one if all it was going to do was chew up electricity for no reason, but if it doesn't actually use more then it doesn't matter so much which case I get. </s>
<s> This topic has been discussed before here and elsewhere. </s>
<s> The basic conclusion is that for a &quot;stable&dependable output&quot; you need a PSU capable of delivering now and later for your needs. </s>
<s> You can always buy what you can afford, but sticking too closely for a cheap or very low wattage psu will cost in the end. </s>
<s> All too often, when a psu does go poof, it may take other componets/devices with it and/or be the source of a possible electrical fire. </s>
<s> So take care in selection and having more wattage than your needs isn't going to hurt as if carrying an extra few $ when going Xmas shopping. </s>
<s> There's a reason for so many PSU's being offered as std. </s>
<s> or typical psu will fail or be &quot;out-grown&quot; before system life. </s>
<s> Its just a safe bet to get a decent psu more than capable of handling your needs, low-wattage or not. </s>
<s> Use the &quot;forum search mode&quot; to access the forums for similar topic. </s>
<s> enjoy tada -----Willy </s>
<s> without PSUs and PSUs without cases. </s>
<s> As it pertains to PCs, it always pays to err on the side of quality and power. </s>
<s> Poor quality usually means earlier failure, potentially erratic computer behavior and warranty replacement hassles. </s>
<s> From this end ... a situation to be avoided whenever and wherever possible. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...and don't overlook PSU efficiency...the higher the PSU efficiency the less electricity your system will actually use. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I had searched but not found the answer to my specific question. </s>
<s> My needs are low and they'll stay low - I'm not a user who'll be wanting to install fancy graphics cards or high-power items. </s>
<s> Pretty much the basics will be installed and that'll be it. </s>
<s> As long as having more &quot;just in case&quot; isn't going to result in wasted power, I may end up getting a higher wattage unit, but I didn't want to get it if all I was doing was getting a power hog for probably no benefit. </s>
<s> But, the separate cases and PSUs seem to work out (much) more expensive, and the bundled Antecs at my local suppliers seem to come with the &quot;Earthwatts&quot; PSUs but the separate ones don't seem to be those ones. </s>
<s> I wanted to get the Earthwatts one, as I gather they are the energy efficient type. </s>
<s> I think I've pretty much decided what to get (although I'll probably change my mind again LOL) Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Here's a review you might be interested to read about the Antec Earthwatts EA500 ...looks good. </s>
<s> PSU's like this aren't usually bundled with cases. </s>
<s> http://www.jonnyguru.com/review_details.php?id=51 Careful and don't look at the Corsair PSUs ... they're the new kid on the PSU block made by a major mfg (Seasonic) and they're getting knockout ratings everywhere . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> 5 year warranty included on the ones' I've seen. </s>
<s> BTW ...energy efficient too...but maybe not as high as the Antec Earthwatt series..80plus. </s>
<s> The ones that are bundled will be fine for me - I won't even have a separate graphics card, and I'm looking at getting a low-powered CPU. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>

<s> I use nothing but 500 or more Watt PSUs even in my 20 Watt CPU based server. </s>
<s> There is no loss here but it does help it ride out some short AC power losses. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Definitely a power consumed depends on it's rating that's why it is marked.Look the general power rating is calculated as P=VIcos*,where * is the angle to which voltage or current lags or leads each other.Incase of integrated devices the load depends on the bias of the semi-conductor chip used.Once the component is overloaded forward biased route is replaced by a reverse biased stream and hence excess of electricity used.And as for unwanted components ,yes it is to be removed asap. </s>
<s> I thought you meant the 500W wasn't bundled, because the ones I've been looking at have the Earthwatts bundled - one has 430W and the other 380W (I think - the case is the worst thing to pick out) </s>
