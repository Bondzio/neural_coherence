I had to take the motherboard out to get to it because the screwdriver kept slipping (Athlon Xp a462). I put everything back together exactly how I found it. Then, when I hit the power button my new fan starts spinning and everything sounds good but nothing show up on the monitor (says no signal). I know the monitor is good because it worked before I took everything apart. I have already reseated the ram, and cpu, and checked voltage on the cmos battery (3v). Did I kill my motherboard? Thanks, All help appreciated.

The video I shared showed how fast this CPU smokes if the heatsink isn't on proper. The big clue is &quot;no beeps.&quot; In closing type BAD CAPS on google.com for another cause. Bob
