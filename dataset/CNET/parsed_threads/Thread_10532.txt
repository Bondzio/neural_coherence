<s> I have been using my m:robe for about 6 months now and it works fine. </s>
<s> I decided to try and use it with Realplayer instead of the M:trip that comes with the m:robe. </s>
<s> Basically it screwed up the m:robe. </s>
<s> Now every time I turn it on the m:robe says &quot;invalid file, missing file&quot; and it won't even let me turn it off using the power button. </s>
<s> I have to wait until it shuts off on it own with the preset shutoff time. </s>
<s> Is there a way to use the m:robe as a drag and drop external hard drive and still have it play music normally? </s>
<s> Does anyone at least have a way to format it so it works the way it was designed again? </s>
<s> I shouldn't have messed with it I know. </s>
<s> Ok, I fixed my m:robe 100 so that it works normally again. </s>
<s> I'm still wondering about making it a drag and drop hard drive while still being able to play music. </s>
