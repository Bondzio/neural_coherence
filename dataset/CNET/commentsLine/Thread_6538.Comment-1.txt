hey, i'm having some trouble in internet connection sharing.
my current setup is like this: i have a wireless router in the living room.
it is connected to a cable modem and an xbox through a wired connection.
in my room i have a computer with a wireless adapter, and it's working .. so i'm recieving wireless internet.
however the problem is this, my computer is connected to another computer via crossover cable.
this is what i want to do: the internet is accessed on the first computer via wireless and the second computer recieves internet through the first computer via ics.
i've tried setting it up, but it the setup keeps telling me that the ip is already in use on the lan ???
just for some extra information i'm using xp the ip of my router is 192.168.0.5 the ip of the first computer is 192.168.0.1 i can't seem to setup the ip of the second computer any help is appreciated!
thanks!
