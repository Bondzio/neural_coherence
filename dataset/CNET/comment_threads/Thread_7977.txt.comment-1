Our PC (HP- a1330n pavilion) stops making noise, monitor goes dark(sleep) but on/off button stays lit.
Nothing we do will bring it back and we can not turn off from switch(button), it must be unplugged from power supply and re-plugged in.
We have our HP plugged into an APC power back-up/monitor both systems are around 3yrs old.
A few months ago I remember a message coming up saying the battery in the APC unit was old and should be replace, which was never done.
Any thoughts or solutions to this problem will be appreciated.
