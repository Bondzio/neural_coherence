1.1.1	I want to revive an old PC based on an ASUS A7V266-E motherboard.	St
1.1.2	The only part missing is a video card (I have a PCI card but I would rather use an AGP one).	St
1.1.3	My motherboard accepts up to 4X AGP video cards.	St
1.1.4	Although I found many of them, they are generally more expensive than 8X cards and also have less video memory.	St
1.1.5	I also found that some 8X cards are backward compatible with 4X slots (some are even compatible with 2X slots).	St
1.1.6	I would like to know if all 8X AGP video cards are backwards compatible with 4X.	St
1.1.7	I really would appreciate any input and/or suggestions.	Polite

1.2.1	I have yet to fit an 8X only card.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Just make sure the AGP card you choose/install is based on 1.5V.	Sug
1.3.2	Older AGP cards were 3.0V.	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
