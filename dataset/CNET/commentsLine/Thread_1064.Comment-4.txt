hi and thank you for your help.
windows has very unhelpfully deleted all my system restore points.
even tho i gave system protection 25% of my 1tb hard drive to use it still deleted the restore points.
i even kept back up restores on another hard drive, which have also been removed by win7.
no devices connected to the computer work.
all the usbs are dead as is the wi-fi and the sound card.
there is no way for me to access the device manager even tho win7 has booted up.
i have tried to boot in safe mode but just the same, no mouse or keyboard.
both the mouse and the keyboard work and are recognised when the windows dvd boots into recovery.
bios recognises the keyboard and the mouse and they both light up before windows starts.
imediately after the bios check finishes and win7 begins to boot, both are deactivated.
apologies for the bad typing in my original post.
i was usinjg my xoom which has a handy spellchecker.
the files i renamed and coped were the c:\windows\inf
