1.1.1	Hello, My company wants to get me a new router for work at home usage, but I am confused on what I should get now.	St
1.1.2	I currently have Belkin router and Belkin cards at home, but all in the old .11b standard.	St
1.1.3	I see now MIMO is out and highly praised, but also listed as to be cautious due to the new .11n that will be implemented; a question of whether the MIMO will be obsolete if not used as the new .11n standard?	St
1.1.4	Does anyone know what is going on with the new standard, MIMO, should I hold off getting a new router at this time?	Ques
1.1.5	-thanks, Russ	St
1.2.1	I found a dlink 834 with 802.11g mimo for not much.	St
1.2.2	Since N seems to be in the wings of 2008, 9 or later I didn't worry about it.	St
1.2.3	So for cheap I updated my router.	St
1.2.4	As to mimo, I thought this was just a way to use multiple antennas and not a standard.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
