I just don't know if I should get a printer with seperate color cartridges or an all in one. And if I get an all in one, when one color goes out do I have to replace the whole thing? I just want to know which would be the most cost effective. Since I noticed some of the cartridges cost almost as much as the unit itself!!

It seems like the more I research The more confused I ge! So If I get the seperate cartridges is there a way that I can refill them myself?

But in a nutshell just look at the offerings. It will sink in quickly. Refills? Sorry, 2 decades of watching others try and I decided to never do that myself. Instead I only print what I really really really (times infinity) need. Big savings. Bob
