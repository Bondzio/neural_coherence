i completely agree.
after 4 months my lacie 250 gig hard drive died as well.
after a discussion with the company representative who suggested using one data recovery service that would cost about $1800, i found another service who charges a bit less.
apparently the 250g drive stresses the components so much (which are cheap anyway to keep the price down)that these drives are very prone to failure.
lacie appears to be apiece of crap in a slick case.
