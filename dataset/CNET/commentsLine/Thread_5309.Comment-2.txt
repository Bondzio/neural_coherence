i didn't bother going to hp.com and looking for the details (you can do that.)
since you have a socket 775 system what usually works is your standard 775 heatsink and fan.
but there are some reports that the motherboard has failed on the fan speed so you may have to ignore that on each boot since most will toss the machine when faced with a defective motherboard.
