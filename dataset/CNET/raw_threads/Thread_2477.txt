I hit Best Buy to touch/feel and saw the ViewSonic VX910 for 449.00 and thought hmmm, but a 25ms response time would not cut it in CounterStike Source, so I went online and saw on the ViewSonic web site the VX910 has a 16 ms response time...hmm. I went back to BB and called ViewSonic from there...any LCD made AFTER December is 16 ms. I gave them the Serial Number of the model on display it was 25 and then the one from the box I was to buy and YIPPIE it was 16!!!!! So, for that price I am happy . Any - just an FYI for any gamers looking for a good LCD 19&quot;...it is SO SWEET.
