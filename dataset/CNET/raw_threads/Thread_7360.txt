It's time for drivesavers.com Backup copies are cheaper but let's hope you have some old copy of what you can't lose. And again, externals are too unreliable to keep the last copy on. Make at least 2 or more on 2 or more devices. Bob

But let's say you are willing to put your files at risk. There is a method I use if I want to try. Let's see how serious you are about this. When I have a deeply damaged system like this I'll CLONE the original to another drive. Then I can use any tool I can find. Many are at the top post in this forum. Sometimes you find folk that were not entirely truthful about what they can't lose and they'll attempt repairs on the original. Bob

Normally this is a matter of backing up the data (just in case if fails), deleting the second partition and expanding the existing partition to use the newly created/unallocated diskspace. VAPCMD
