<s> Im going to need a PC that will run a few apps and probably a couple of games that dont require high-end graphics. </s>
<s> I looked around and came up with these specifications: Intel Core 2 Duo [2.6 GHz] DDR2 Ram [2 GB] Hard Disk (sata) [250 GB] Graphics Card [256 MB] Now, I'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that I'm going to need other than a case. </s>
<s> Everyone seems to forget the psu(power supply) and is taken for granted. </s>
<s> All too often supplied with a new case while they work, may not for long or be underpowered. </s>
<s> A decent system needs a good psu in order to remain stable and provide steady outputs. </s>
<s> If you plan not to get into heavy gaming and generally a typical home system, a 500W+ psu will do fine. </s>
<s> There are cheap offerings out there in the 500W range and when you look into the matter see the difference price makes and what will suit you. </s>
<s> I take it seriously the lack of a decent psu in new systems, because of the reasons above. </s>
<s> Everything else you mentioned seems OK. Use common sense and proceed, good luck. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the configs are ok try to improve the VGA and get somethng good, try some awesome multimedia accessories tooo </s>
<s> Be sure to get good RAM don't get anything less than PC2 6400 and be sure its a decent brand like Kingston or Corsair. </s>
<s> Maybe upgrade the graphics card. </s>
<s> Two gigabytes can run a server and 256 megabytes can run a desktop and an emulated layer with games on each. </s>
<s> like the thing you need would be under $450. </s>
<s> If you can try to go for an Nvidia GeForce 9600GT graphics card with 512MB vram. </s>
<s> Make sure that the SMPS or PSU (the power supply)is 500W or better. </s>
<s> Try to get a DVD writer, its helpful in data backup. </s>
<s> If you're going to watch movies you can add a Blu Ray player at a later date when Blu Ray discs become mainstream. </s>
<s> Go for a decent 19&quot; LCD monitor or better </s>
