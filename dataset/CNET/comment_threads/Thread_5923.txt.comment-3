Go into the BIOS to your video settings.
When you enter, it should have the Onboard option, AGP options, and an auto configuration.
When you enter into the AGP options, it should have speeds indicated.
If it simply says AGP, or if you can select AUTO, a 4X/8X will do fine.
If you install an AGP card, disable the onboard graphics controller in the Windows DEVICE MANAGER prior to installing the card.
