With today's wide variety of pests and most unaware about current antivirus, firewall, spyware scans and that using another browser than IE helps, it's all too common for people to have software issues.
Then we have those P2P file sharing users and you get a picture that loss is going to happen.
There is not a clear picture of what's causing your issue or why you had to format it elsewhere.
That's a big clue and points to either a real problem or just some procedural oversight that you cured by formatting elsewhere.
As long as it's working and you have armed yourself to the eyeballs with the protections and are not a P2P user it's likely it will be fine.
