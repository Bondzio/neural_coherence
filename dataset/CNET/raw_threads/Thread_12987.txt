Trouble is, when I see the thumbnails, they've all got this generic picture on them & clicking on them gets me this pop up message telling me I don't have the correct permissions to access this file location. How do I fix/ change this?

I've checked several of the links, & had Googled around & most said the same thing: Right-click on the folder/file, security tab, owner tab, add the name, etc, etc. Did it all. Still won't open the files. I managed to open *one* photo. But I Know I don't want to have to do one at a time. Why did this happen in the 1st place & why is it so difficult to just enable what I need??
