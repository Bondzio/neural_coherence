I've been having a problem with my computer, and I don't really know which part goes wrong. when I first bought my computer (like 6 months ago), everything went fine except the VGA card (GeForce 7600GS) and one of the memory stick (1GB), so I decided to go buy a new VGA card and new memory stick. now, I have 1 VGA card, GeForce 8600GTS and 1 GB memory stick (Corsair). I was pretty sure that this time everything would go fine. alas, my computer froze again after I had installed the driver =(. this time is even worse, I can't even start my windows. so I decided to take off my VGA card and use onboard VGA card. with on board VGA card I can run any application as much and as long as I want, but as soon as I run any other heavy game application, such as Warcraft, it will freeze =(. I really have no idea what's going on with my computer, - is it because the VGA card not compatible with the motherboard (GA-VM900M, chipset: VIA P4M900)?? - is it because the driver itself(NVidia GeForce 8600GTS driver) clashes with the motherboard?? - could the problem is probably caused by the power supply (not enough power or something)?? As a note here, Motherboard GA-VM900M support PCI-E, and I bet you guys have already known that GeForce 8 series are mostly available for PCI-E. Does anyone know how to solve my problem?? or has anyone encountered the same problem as mine before and has got it solved?? I completely stuck here please help, any feedback will be appreciated! the following actions have been done in order to detect the problem: 1. Memory testing, result: ok 2. updating motherboard driver 3. downloading the latest VGA driver from the site

What size and type power supply do you have and did you connect the extra power connector to the card?
