<s> I am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive. </s>
<s> When i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it, but also things that have been in stalled in the past. </s>
<s> Two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers. </s>
<s> Also there is a file called &quot;WuTempt&quot;, and &quot;msdownload.tmp&quot; and four ffast files. </s>
<s> Is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything. </s>
<s> Your choice on the matter. </s>
<s> WUTEMP was a windows update temporary directory. </s>
<s> I've seen some delete it without harm. </s>
<s> If your post has typographic errors, I'd show some neatnic tendency and offer a correction. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> lol k i just deleted teh ones with temp and i put the others in a folder. </s>
<s> hopefully everything goes well. </s>
<s> If you have MS Office, take it's functions out of &quot;Startup&quot; and turn off &quot;FastFind&quot; which is what the &quot;ff&quot; stuff usually is. </s>
<s> Also, if your OS is XP, you can probably turn off system restore for drives you just use for storage because it won't save those for you. </s>
