1.1.1	First off , specs : Athlon XP 2400+ Epox 8k5A2+ GeForce Nvidia 7600GS AGP PowerMagic 350w PS Sony Dru-84A DVD-Burner CD-4x4x32 CD-Burner At the moment , I 'm back to XP Pro SP3 .	St
1.1.2	I ran for about 2yrs on XP with 1GB of PC2100 DDR DIMMS configured so:1x512MB/PC2100_2x256MB/PC2100 and XP was happy .	St
1.1.3	I installed Vista Ultimate and it grunted a bit so I ordered a 1GB PC2100 chip online .	St
1.1.4	It arrived and I installed it .	St
1.1.5	Configuration is now this:1GB 1st bank-512MB 2nd bank-256Mb 3rd bank .	St
1.1.6	Now to the techy stuff .	St
1.1.7	During the day , my machine would die .	St
1.1.8	No warning , no shutting down , dead .	St
1.1.9	Sometimes it would boot right back up , sometimes not .	St
1.1.10	When it would n't , the post codes would not read either .	St
1.1.11	My best guess was ( with my limited knowlege ) was it had to be memory related .	St
1.1.12	I pulled both the 256MB chip and the 512MB chip then booted to a disk with Windows Memtest v3.3 .	St
1.1.13	All tests passed .	St
1.1.14	( I think this problem was just poor contact with one or more of the chips . )	St
1.1.15	Fired Vista up , and ran Everest Ultimate .	St
1.1.16	Surprise ! !	St
1.1.17	Field Value Memory Module Properties Serial Number None Module Size 1 GB ( 2 ranks , 4 banks ) Module Type Unbuffered Memory Type DDR SDRAM Memory Speed PC3200 ( 200 MHz ) Module Width 64 bit Module Voltage SSTL 2.5 Error Detection Method None Refresh Rate Reduced ( 7.8 us ) , Self-Refresh Memory Timings @ 200 MHz 3.0-3-3-8 ( CL-RCD-RP-RAS ) / 11-14-2 ( RC-RFC-RRD ) @ 166 MHz 2.5-3-3-7 ( CL-RCD-RP-RAS ) / 10-12-2 ( RC-RFC-RRD ) @ 133 MHz 2.0-2-2-6 ( CL-RCD-RP-RAS ) / 8-10-2 ( RC-RFC-RRD ) Memory Module Features Early RAS # Precharge Not Supported Auto-Precharge Not Supported Precharge All Not Supported Write1/Read Burst Not Supported Buffered Address/Control Inputs Not Supported Registered Address/Control Inputs Not Supported On-Card PLL ( Clock ) Not Supported Buffered DQMB Inputs Not Supported Registered DQMB Inputs Not Supported Differential Clock Input Supported Redundant Row Address Not Supported It 's 1GB PC3200 !	St
1.1.18	The Epox mobo will only support up to PC2700 .	St
1.1.19	XP PRO SP3 is running fat an sassy on this 1GB PC3200 .	St
1.1.20	How ?	Ques
1.1.21	Was the combination of PC3200 and PC2100 the problem ?	Ques
1.1.22	Is leaving this PC3200 chip in going to be a problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	To find Vista doing that .	St
1.2.2	Let 's call it not ready for primetime on homebuilt machines .	St
1.2.3	For instance it can be picky about the BIOS and all the drivers .	St
1.2.4	Is it worth the time ?	Ques
1.3.1	This is not about Vista .	St
1.3.2	This is a hardware forum and my questions are about memory chips .	St
1.4.1	And you wrote about Vista Ultimate .	St
1.4.2	If the issue is not about Vista , then that is lost in your posting .	St
1.4.3	However there is an damming issue with those boards and when you fill all the slots .	St
1.4.4	The memory timing must be relaxed ( slowed ) for it to work .	St
1.4.5	The owners are miffed about that and there is nothing you can do for them since it 's a design flaw .	St
1.4.6	They usually take a few weeks to look into it and they discover the truth .	St
1.4.7	Keep those old boards with just 2 sticks to steer around the issue .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	You truly need to check the specs/details of your mtrbd.. Just what it does support .	Sug
1.5.2	If you find no mention of PC3200 , then it does n't support it ( fully ) .	St
1.5.3	If you ordered PC2100 and got a PC3200 which can be used in SOME systems , only because they are better capable .	St
1.5.4	You have a Epox mtrbd .	St
1.5.5	which is more of a beginning/entry type system .	St
1.5.6	Its chipset and others become limited in supporting & quot ; fully populated & quot ; ram slots as a timing issue arises .	St
1.5.7	Not only that , but you have 3-different ram sizes and RAS/CAS reports , this is n't ideal .	St
1.5.8	Your results are to be expected or arise sooner or later .	St
1.5.9	Basically , nothing you can do , other than get another new module like you 've received , remove the others ( 256 & 512mbs ) and/or order 2-1gb of PC2700 ( return the PC3200 ) .	St
1.5.10	Use only 2 ram slots to help resolve this issue as well .	St
1.5.11	Some have regressed the ram timing , etc .	St
1.5.12	to get it to work , but that basically forces it to be slower and what 's the point of having fast ram .	St
1.5.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Yes and no ... ... Vista is creating some strange hardware issues .	St
1.6.2	As with win9x dissimilar memory would pass diagnostic tests in DOS but fail in Windows using NSW memory test utility ( Norton System Works .	St
1.6.3	Your original memory configuration proves this to be true using a single stick of RAM .	St
1.6.4	Or with dissimilar memory the system would not boot due to the MB support .	St
1.6.5	Couple of other items I have seen : Client added 4 gigs of RAM to his system , Vista 32 bit , for a total of 6 gigs of RAM .	St
1.6.6	Task Manager reported 2 gigs ( no switch on Boot.Ini ) of Physical RAM , 4 gigs of virtual memory .	St
1.6.7	Upgraded laptops to 1 gig of memory pulled from the shelfs at ( you know who ) .	St
1.6.8	These systems run doggy and strange , re-order/install the correct RAM no issues .	St
1.6.9	In closing Vista is going to force us to re-evaluate what we know of Hardware/OS relationships .	St
1.6.10	To answer your first question No Vista will run w/1 gig of RAM .	St
1.6.11	2 would be better .	St
1.6.12	Luck Bill	St
1.7.1	As I bought the board new a few years back .	St
1.7.2	I have the manuals and stuff so specs are avialable and state that this board with Via chipset KT333 supports PC1600/PC2100/PC2700 DDR.Right now it is running fat and sassy with 1GB of PC3200 .	St
1.7.3	How is that happening and will it cause any harm in the long run ?	Ques
1.7.4	If not , I 'll buy another stick of PC3200 .	St
1.8.1	If you research this you find you are not alone in finding that all slots full fails .	St
1.8.2	Feel free to pester the board 's maker .	Sug
1.8.3	Here I just move to 2 sticks ...	St
1.9.1	You open yourself to a possible glitch as it was n't intended to support PC3200 ram .	St
1.9.2	However , keeping it to 2 slots of ram and equivalent types will help keep the problems at bay .	St
1.9.3	There 's no guarantee on this as your manual already states it does n't support PC3200 .	St
1.9.4	If possible and available , see if the bios has an update that may address this issue , but be sure what that updates does , as you may not need it or benefit from it .	St
1.9.5	PC3200 is nothing more than faster ram and keeps the same voltage requirements , so its up to you .	St
1.9.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
