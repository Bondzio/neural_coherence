1.1.1	i 'm getting an asus essentio CG5275-AR003 that i will be using for gaming .	St
1.1.2	but i want to get a video card for it seen as it only has an integrated card .	St
1.1.3	i 'm already shellin out 700 bucks for the computer so i cant spend to much on the card only 100-150. i dont know much about the subject so please help .	St
1.2.1	Choose your pick from http : //www.tomshardware.com/charts/gaming-graphics-charts-q3-2008/benchmarks,30.html .	St
1.2.2	It 's up to you to decide between high-quality or mainstream .	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	i just need some advice .	St
1.3.2	i dont even know where to start .	St
1.3.3	the site you gave me does n't help because i know nothing about any video cards .	St
1.3.4	maybe a link to a video card buying guide would be more helpful	Sug
1.4.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/graphics-cards/ ? tag=leftColumnArea.0 is our own review section .	St
1.4.2	That might be somewhat more intelligeable .	St
1.4.3	And I would say , first have a look at the system requirements of the games you want to play .	St
1.4.4	It could be they play well enough using the integrated graphics .	St
1.4.5	If not , you 'll learn the minimum requirements you need .	St
1.4.6	Even if the motherboard comes with integrated graphics , you can add a videocard of your choice later .	St
1.4.7	So there 's no need to decide now .	St
1.4.8	Why not postpone your decision ?	Ques
1.4.9	Kees	St
1.5.1	thanks for the advice .	Polite
1.5.2	i 'd planned on trying the onboard one first .	St
1.5.3	but just thought id figure out which one i would get if the performance is n't up to my standards .	St
