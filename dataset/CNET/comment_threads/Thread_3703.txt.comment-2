Those WiFi speeds are under the best of conditions.
i.e.
laboratory results.
Also, if the wifi card in the laptops are well, not current or from the same maker as the router, speeds do fall.
I've only seen full speeds under ideal conditions and when I used a linksys router and matching linksys wifi cards.
Why not let linksys swap that router?
