there are lots of dual core cpus with lower clock speeds that do far better on benchmarks you do realize right?
if you want to recycle the ram from your existing computer you should specify what that is, imo.
lastly, you could go with some cheap socket 939 amd64 configuration but this will have limits on upgrading you know.
