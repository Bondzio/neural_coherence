<s> Could someone please tell me how to resolve the following,I hace two printers bot hooked up to a HP Pav 6230 running win Vista Home Prem.Is there a way that when I send a doc(usually a web site or page that has info that i want to read or save(in print form) to the printer that I can adjust the font size.Most pages print with the font so small I have trouble reading it. </s>
<s> Thank you Pat </s>
<s> Look at the top right of the screen and you will see print and the icon of a printer. </s>
<s> Click the down arrow and click Print preview. </s>
<s> You should see shrink to fit just above the document to be printed. </s>
<s> Click the down arrow and that should give you a drop down with a bunch of %. </s>
<s> I use the highest one that gives me everything I need printed and click print. </s>
