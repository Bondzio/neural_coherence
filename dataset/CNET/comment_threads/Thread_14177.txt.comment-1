Hey all.
I have a D-Link DI-624 wireless router and my ISP is Charter.
I have two issues: 1) Lately, I've been losing connection to the internet, but not to the network.
The connection loss has reached a significant frequency, sometimes I lose it every minute.
Makes online gaming near impossible.
2) Sometimes while I do have a stable connection, I'll have extremely slow speeds.
My ping will break 1000ms when I try pinging www.google.com.
So I'd like some suggestions as to how to fix these problems, and whether or not it's my ISP or router's fault.
Thanks in advance.
