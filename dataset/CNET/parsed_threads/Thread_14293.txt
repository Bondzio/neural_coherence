<s> Here is what I would like to do. </s>
<s> I want to have a machine running XP Pro with a shared drive visible on the network, but have no one logged on to that machine. </s>
<s> This is will allow the other machines to access the network drive, and to administer the machine I can remote in from one of the other pcs. </s>
<s> Is this possible without logging in? </s>
<s> Thanks Michael </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> But let's define &quot;logging on.&quot; If you mean &quot;must the Windows GUI be logged in?&quot; That is, the name and password on the HOST be entered where you see the start button then the answer changes to &quot;yes.&quot; But under the hood there is a login occurring when a CLIENT connects and asks for connection to a share. </s>
<s> How deep must we go here? </s>

<s> What I want is a small pc running XP Pro. </s>
<s> When it boots no one logs on to the pc, but the drive on the PC is shared to the network. </s>
<s> The other 3 computers running XP Pro need to access this shared drive. </s>
<s> This is in a peer-to-peer network so there is no server involved. </s>
<s> I'm trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office. </s>
<s> They don't need the security. </s>
<s> I was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other PCs to administer the box if necessary. </s>
<s> Does this help? </s>

<s> It sat in a corner on the floor with nothing attached but a keyboard. </s>
<s> We could use the keyboard to turn it on or WOL and it could be shut down remotely. </s>
<s> What we did was pre-define all users needing access including the administrator account and then recreate these same accounts on the PCs that would gain access. </s>
<s> The shares were setup and permissions assigned to those who needed access. </s>
<s> When done properly, a user could login to a remote PC that already had an account on that &quot;server&quot; device. </s>
<s> They could navigate to an authorized share and would not be asked for a username/password. </s>
<s> Another way to do this would be to map the shares as needed to remote PCs or create shortcuts on the desktop. </s>
<s> In this way, the accessible shares were only visible when logged into these specific accounts. </s>
<s> This only seems to work with Windows SMB but not remotely using FTP. </s>
<s> Be aware that XP Pro has a ten user login limit. </s>
<s> Because of the 10 user limit and the need to accommodate more students at once, we went to a Windows XP embedded NAS drive that allowed 25 simultaneous users. </s>
<s> These devices, however, cannot be used like PCs. </s>
<s> They don't run software or third party utilities. </s>
<s> The one we got has remote administration capability and can be set up for remote ftp or http access over the web. </s>
<s> It also resides in a relay rack. </s>
<s> Since all the machines logon using the same user id then it should be possible to map to the &quot;not logged on&quot; box without a problem. </s>
<s> We don't really need a lot of security so the user ID is all the same. </s>
<s> I will keep working on this, this gives me some more ideas. </s>
<s> Thanks Michael </s>
<s> Once you issue the share in Windows you don't need to log on that machine for the share to function. </s>
<s> However from the CLIENT machine there is a log on process so what wipes some beginning networkers is that you must have a log on account on the machine you are logging into as well as on the machine that is sharing. </s>
<s> I won't rewrite this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since all the machines use the same logon, this should be easy, just don't log that particular machine on in the morning and remotely administer it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help everyone. </s>

<s> and not just a network attached storage drive? </s>
<s> Why waste an XP license and a good piece of hardware if you just want access to files in shares. </s>
<s> A NAS that supports Windows SMB will do that quite well. </s>
<s> Remote administration is a minimal chore. </s>
<s> You need to turn it on/off, create/delete shares, add/remove users and do backups...not much more. </s>
<s> They don't need much in the way of resources and can be quite small. </s>
<s> I have been looking into NAS for this situation as well. </s>
<s> I cannot seem to find a reliable, reasonably priced NAS that will suite their needs. </s>
<s> I have been reading a lot of reviews on different NAS devices and some people love them and some hate them. </s>
<s> Wasting an XP license isn't really a problem. </s>
<s> I have extra one at the moment and also have a licensed copy of Windows 2000 that I no longer use. </s>
<s> I'm still researching all possibilities and haven't ruled the NAS out yet. </s>
<s> I also need the system easy for them to switch to a backup incase the NAS or PC dies. </s>
<s> Thanks Michael </s>
<s> While you can't install to a partition over 127GB (just like XP) it handles the big drives once the service pack is added just fine. </s>
<s> It boots faster than XP and from memory allows more connections than XP. </s>
