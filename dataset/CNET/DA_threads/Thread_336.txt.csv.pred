1.1.1	I am running an Athlon 64X2 dual core processor 6400+ 3.2 Ghz with 4 gig ram on a Gigabyte GA-M52S-S3P motherboard.I have a dual boot set up with the main hard drive on a SATA connection and the secondary hard drive on IDE , both are running XP SP2 .	St
1.1.2	About 50 % of the time the screen freezes on boot up just after the single beep tells me that the BIOS is OK and about halfway through the screen listing the hardware .	St
1.1.3	After several attempts the system will boot OK .	St
1.1.4	I have updated the BIOS , but can not find any reason for the freezing .	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions would be welcome .	St
1.1.6	Thanks ,	St
1.2.1	This sounds defective .	St
1.2.2	Can you RMA it ?	Ques
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	I am looking for possible causes to avoid having to return the unit halfway across Australia , and I have reset and upgraded the cmos .	St
1.4.2	Thanks for responding .	St
1.5.1	A new annoyance is if you built it yourself you must check the RAM VOLTAGE , settings and more to see if they match the RAM & quot ; specifications & quot ; as well as never overtax the power supply .	St
1.5.2	As it stands you have a defective machine but so few details ( such as I built it myself ) that my first thought is the warranty .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	I have several suggestions .	St
1.6.2	First try re-seating any additional cards you are using ; i.e .	St
1.6.3	video card , network card , sound card .	St
1.6.4	If no help , go to device manager .	St
1.6.5	( in control panel|system properties| hardware tab ) and check for any yellow question marks next to each hardware item .	St
1.6.6	If any found , you need to get the proper device driver .	St
1.6.7	If all hardware drivers properties say & quot ; this device is working properly & quot ; time to try something else .	St
1.6.8	Re-boot into Safe Mode ( Hit F8 key after post beep ) and see if the boot process hangs after a certain driver is loaded .	St
1.6.9	If it hangs , the last driver listed is the last driver that was successfully loaded .	St
1.6.10	Take note of that listing and reboot again .	St
1.6.11	If the system boots successfully ( without hang ) note the driver that was loaded after the previous hang spot .	St
1.6.12	You may try updating that driver .	St
1.6.13	Your case is difficult because it sometimes boots correctly .	St
1.6.14	Try removing all extra cards and just boot with video card , keyboard , mouse , and hard drives .	St
1.6.15	If no hang , you may have a bad device preventing boot .	St
1.6.16	Go into the BIOS and check that the setting & quot ; Plug and Play OS & quot ; is enabled .	St
1.6.17	You may have a bad motherboard .	St
1.6.18	I had one once that would take 2 or three minutes to boot , but would never hang !	St
1.6.19	I soon got tired of that and canned it !	St
