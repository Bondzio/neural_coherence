<s> Ok so I get this system off newegg and all and for the most part I have built over 10 systems and never have a problem. </s>
<s> This time I got me a 10,000 RPM SATA drive and can not get it working. </s>
<s> 1st off here is what I got. </s>
<s> Mainboard http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=13-180-061&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE Hard Drive http://www.newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-200&depa=0&manufactory=BROWSE When the computer boots up it does not list the drive. </s>
<s> I enter the bois and have it look and it does not notice the drive. </s>
<s> I can run f-disk, then start to install windows. </s>
<s> when it starts to copy files over I get a blue screen saying it has stoped installation to prevent damage and list a error like I press f6 during the install and then it asked for a disk. </s>
<s> I have a disk that came with the Mainboard. </s>
<s> It then asked for a disk in drive a: I then picked raid, and storage drive drivers. </s>
<s> It installed them..then thats when I get the blue screen of death. </s>
<s> A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to provent damage to your computer. </s>
<s> Blah blah STOP xxx00x0x00x00x00x </s>
<s> The blue screen on install is typical of a hardware issue. </s>
<s> You need to find the bad ram/board and get it exchanged. </s>
<s> There's no clue in your post about what parts you changed out. </s>
<s> Or if you tried a PATA drive. </s>
<s> Another fine issue is that most boards do not come with a current BIOS and your post does not tell if such was updated. </s>
