<s> I'm not very computer literate, and I just wanted to buy some network cables. </s>
<s> I wanted to know what the difference between CAT5 and CAT6 cables are. </s>
<s> They look the same to me. </s>
<s> they are 2 different categories of cables. </s>
<s> Cat6 has double the bandwidth of cat5 which boils down to a little more reliability. </s>
<s> You can use either cables with your computer. </s>
<s> I would recommend cat6 as applications are getting larger and the added bandwidth of a cat6 will accommedate better. </s>
<s> Some good quality cheap cables can be found at www.tendonusa.com. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> They are wired the same, they appear, on the outside, to be the same. </s>
<s> but Cat6 has better shielding, and perhaps better insulation. </s>
<s> If you are needing something for short runs, like just a few feet, then either cable will work fine, but if you are needing something that is going to go further, or near high radio-noise inducing areas, like near actual transmitting radios, or power lines, then if you have 1Gb (Gigabit) devices (on both ends) minimize the possible noise conflict and get Cat6 cables. </s>
<s> There is no shielding with UTP, or &quot;unshielded twisted pair&quot; Ethernet cables and STP or &quot;shielded twisted pair&quot; is rarely ever used. </s>
<s> For commercial applications, Cat.6 which is capable of speeds up to 10 Gig, is installed to accomodate future equipment upgrades and technology advances. </s>
<s> For the small office/home office user, Cat.5 UTP's rating of 100Mbps is sufficient at a more attractive price. </s>
<s> What do you want to do, quibble about something that is really unimportant to the original question? </s>
<s> Yes, I know that the one idea of shielding, where it is grounded, does not actually apply to the 8 wires, 4 twisted pairs of wires, in the Ethernet wiring called Cat5, Cat5e or even Cat6. </s>
<s> But there is a sheath, and it is generally constructed of aluminum foil, that is what some people call shielding. </s>
<s> You even said &quot;'shielded twisted pair' is rarely ever used&quot; Rarely? </s>
<s> so then it does happen? </s>
<s> If you look up, on Wikipedia (granted, a collection of many people's input, but that is what makes it knowledge more well rounded, and not just one persons opinion) you'll read that &quot;Many such cables are unshielded but some are shielded .&quot; The person who started this thread just wanted to know the what the difference between CAT5 and CAT6 cables are, since they look the same. </s>
<s> I think I answered the question well enough to show swarm567 that the appearance is the same. </s>
<s> It is unlikely he'll ever construct any of the cables himself. </s>
<s> I even recommended that, depending upon the circumstance (and I gave examples), the Cat5 cable will probably work fine for him. </s>
<s> As for saying Ethernet cable is not shielded, is wrong. </s>
<s> You are thinking only twisted pair. </s>
<s> The original Ethernet cable, as designed by Xerox (where I was employed from 1970 to 2004) was not only shielded, but it was double-shielded. </s>
<s> It was very thick (some called it &quot;thicknet&quot;), about a half inch, co-ax cable; and required special tapping devices to get past the double shield (some people called them &quot;vampire taps&quot;) to connect the transceiver boxes (I am so glad nobody uses that stuff anymore - except maybe masochists ). </s>
<s> I'm sorry for using a word that you felt the need to correct me. </s>
<s> Perhaps what you added was useful for swarm567 , but I don't think so. </s>
