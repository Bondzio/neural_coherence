trying to figure what they are getting at... whether it is more than simply a scam to extract as much money as possible.
if you use a nat masquarade of any type, it won't &quot;mess up their network&quot;.
it might be that someone has attached a router to their network before and has caused problems through misconfiguration.
make sure all dynamic routing or other &quot;chatty&quot; protocols are off - so you don't end up inadvertently adding routes to their network.
and turn off snmp.
can they detect it... theoretically know (other than visually!)
but it depends on the behaviour.
if they were really intent on detection, then it is feasible i guess.
for example, a pc making multiple http connections will increment the source port each time.
with masquarate nat (pat) the source ports are modified as the router is traversed.
depending on the router used, it might use a random sequence for the source port rather than increment.
or os finger printing techniques could be used if the two devices are different.
but i doubt it is in the realms of reason that they would go to this trouble.
more likely someone will wander around and ask why you have a network device plugged in.
