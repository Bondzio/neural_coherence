hello everyone, i have a dell optiplex gx270 and it's only a few years old.
i recently started getting problems with the monitor, usb mouse and usb keyboard shutting off after a normal boot up.
it's not always consistant with boot up.
sometimes it will happen when running a program.
the power light is still on and fan is running when it occurs leaving me to believe it's power supply.
i also replaced the motherboard 3v lithium battery after i got the system voltage battery low warning.i did have the machine on a surge protector and into the wall electrical outlet, hoping that would fix my issue.
i still have the same result.
please advise if i should replace my power supply or motherboard next.
or both.
thanks in advance symbolize
