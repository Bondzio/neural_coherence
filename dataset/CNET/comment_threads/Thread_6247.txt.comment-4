I would upgrade to XP from ME first and, then Video card.
Stay with nvidia in my opinion.
They make a great product and, are always working on new drivers for your cards.
There is an upgrade every couple months with my geforce and they keep adding new features.
You can never have too much memory also.
Another hard drive is always great for backup and storage.
Stay with AMD All the way Brother!
