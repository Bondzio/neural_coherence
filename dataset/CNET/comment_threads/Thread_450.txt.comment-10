Hi there, Came to talk about Benchmarking.
first of all benchmarking is meaningless until you try out the process on your own different benchmarking programs will differ in performance, speed, quality, and reliable with other types of motherboards it can differ from the above Now right now I just tested my computer on the program called everest home edition im using an AMD 1.2Ghz FSB of 133Mhz now the memory read is the benchmark option now my memory read is in 19th place out of a 1st place Pentium 4 running at 1.6Ghz my AMD has a percentage of 918MB while a P4 has a big 1940MB percentage difference and it only went up by 4 meaning the processor im using a outdated FIC AZ11E(A) motherboard while the P4 is running an Asus P4B266 motherboard so what is the difference between them is that they're using different motherboards and chipsets and the P4 only went up by 4 my amd is in 19th place why is that??
because the benchmarking can differ between different benchmarking programs which is meaningless to try and so what if it has a faster FSB it doesnt matter you say AMD is faster but why can't it catch up when I have an outdated AMD and the intel that shows on this program is even outdated i've read what you had to say but it still doesnt prove anything unless you can give me something that is actual proof like a video of both processors running WinXP Professional and seeing how fast they actually boot up intel may lack some features but amd also lacks features itself either people accept intel or amd there isnt gonna be a best processor because no such thing exist now about ati and nvidia there isn't such proof that nvidia is in first nor is ati like I said before video cards can differ between having a whole different set of motherboards processors and all the other things you need in a computer the way AGP works is by using the system memory and the cpu the lower the cpu the lower system memory which is ram is gonna resolve in slower performance coming from your video card but oh well here's some info about AGP http://computer.howstuffworks.com/agp.htm see ya soon
