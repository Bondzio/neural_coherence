ahh.. system integration less is more and the simplicity of having it all in one unit.
this is the way computers should be built, right??
maybe, or maybe not??
the thing about integrated parts such as video is this, what if??
what if the card is such a drag on the system it actually drags the system down many cards actually share system memory and if you have slower memory modules such as 533-667 it can be a drag if you play some games.
then there are the obvious what if's.
what if its upgrade time now it sits idle in the system doing nothing.
also lets keep in mind the inevitable failure.. what do you do now??
well now you have to purchase a card anyway.
thats if you are lucky enough to have it only be the video go and not take the nb controller as well (happened to me a few weeks ago).
a half way decent card should be no more than about $99 and some more power dual processor cards can round the 500 and beyond range.
however most systems now disable the onboard cards once the external graphics card is found thus freeing board resources.
and free means fast.
so we have a dedicated processor for graphics dedicated memory for graphics and less drag on the system cpu to do more of what we designed the thing to do in the first place.. but ultimately the choice is to the user.. some manufacturers are already completely removing integrated graphics cards once again.
in light of this single dilemma to go external or not?
?
