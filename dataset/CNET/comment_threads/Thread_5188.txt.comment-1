I have a general question this morning.
I've been doing fine with my laptop to router signal for the most part.
However, every now and then, about every 4 or 5 days, I may loose connection for some reason.
I have found that the easiest way to fix the issue, is unplug the router, take a bathroom break and voila.
Should I be worried about any long term affects from doing this?
I have a dlink WBR1310.
Settings are on TKIP, PSK, WPA Enhanced.
Any comment or feedback appreciated.
