<s> I am running Windows Xp SP3 with an Asus A7V600 Mobo, CPU is an AMDAthlon XP3200+ Barton core, 1 Gb SDRAM by Corsair, 1 ATI 9600XT Graphics Card w/Dell 21&quot; LCD widescreen, 2 HD's (1 SATA & 1 IDE), 1 Asus 52x CDROM (IDE), 1 Plextor PX-755SA DVD(SATA) writer and 1 Plextor PX-708A IDE writer with all drivers and firmware updated running ECDC 7 basic including Drgtodsc which is what I use most to move all my data and programs to my dvd+rw's. </s>
<s> Everything was working fine for a good while, then I burned some audio cd's with windows media player 11 and all went fine. </s>
<s> Then I ripped some cd's with windows media player with no problems. </s>
<s> Then I tried copying some data files to my dvd+rw where I keep all of my saved programs and that's when all my troubles started. </s>
<s> Windows does not recognized my dvd's as dvd's. </s>
<s> It shows them as cd's. </s>
<s> I have checked just about everything there is to check according to the searches I have done through Google and my dvd shows up as cd's and I cannot read or write to my dvd's at all. </s>
<s> It gives me an error, &quot;please insert disk&quot; and the dvd is in the writer. </s>
<s> It also says media not recognized. </s>
<s> I put my dvd+rw in either writer and it just shows it blank and i know I have plenty of data on them. </s>
<s> I can put cd's in my dvd's and read, copy, move, etc. </s>
<s> to them all day, but of course I cannot write to them. </s>
<s> I use a Linksys Router for my firewall and I also have a firewall for spyware, adware, and all those other kind of baddies that try to get through to my PC and I have not had any problems on that end that I can find. </s>
<s> I ran some rootkit scanners and they come up okay. </s>
<s> I think something changed when I ran media player to burn the audio cd's, because everything had been running fine for a good while. </s>
<s> If it was happening on just 1 dvd, I could surmise that it might be bad but, since I have two burners doing the same thing I think something else has happened and I need some big time HELP! </s>
<s> I have uninstalled Roxio ECDC 7 basic and some other things advised by others and still nothing good has come about. </s>
<s> If someone out ther could give me some help I would be greatly appreciative. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch for listening. </s>
<s> Never has. </s>
<s> But about ECDC. </s>
<s> A recent poster noted they had to get some update from Roxio and it worked. </s>
<s> I won't go find that for you but Windows XP doesn't know what a DVDRW drive is. </s>
<s> Never has and never will. </s>
<s> Don't try to fix that. </s>
<s> Work on your Roxio issue. </s>
<s> &quot;I cannot read or write to my dvd's at all. </s>
<s> It gives me an error, &quot;please insert disk&quot; and the dvd is in the writer.&quot; Research removing the UPPERFILTERS and LOWERFILTERS entries in the registry if no media is being read. </s>
<s> Also if you use any packet writing software you have to reinstall that or the media is not readable. </s>

<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> I understood what you said and I went for a fix for Roxio ECDC 7 and software. </s>
<s> I uninstalled Windows XP Pro SP3, then updated SP2, then I uninstalled Internet Explorer 7 and it reverted to version 6 and I updated version 6 and then I did a clean uninstall of Roxio ECDC 7 basic. </s>
<s> Then while leaving my computer with Windows XP Pro SP2(updated)and Internet Explore 6(updated), I reinstalled Roxio ECDC 7 Basic from my Plextor DVD and everything has worked fine ever since. </s>
<s> I had to make a few adjustments as they came up, but none were real hard and now I can write to my all my optical drives with Roxio ECDC. </s>
<s> DrgToDsk works great again without a hitch. </s>
<s> Again thanks alot for steering me in the right direction. </s>
<s> Sorry I couldn't tell you exactly what to do but sometimes it helps to read what others have run into. </s>
<s> Cheers for getting out your hammer. </s>
