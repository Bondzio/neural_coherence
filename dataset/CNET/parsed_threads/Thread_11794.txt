<s> I would like to know if this device (wireless N bridge) will help to access my games and blue ray player that are sometimes out of range from my wireless router? </s>
<s> These devices are part of my home entertainment center that is in the basement rec room ; away from my router in the upstairs office. </s>
<s> All the blue ray content is DRM (see google) and is locked up tightly so let's just say no. </s>
<s> As to the game, you didn't tell enough. </s>

<s> Thankyou for replying Bob! </s>
<s> I have a wireless router (D-Link Dir615) for my network and everything is connecting OK most of the time, but my Wii and Sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates. </s>
<s> I have the ability to go online with the Wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray. </s>
<s> It would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home! </s>
<s> -Both have web accessability. </s>
<s> Wii has USB but I believe Sony uses RJ45. </s>
<s> My connection isn't always present. </s>

<s> I read your first post and it reads as if you want to access your blu ray from other places, same about the games. </s>
<s> This is a no go area or rather all the copy protections and more mean we can't use our blu ray and games from other places in the house with any reliable, published, you and I can set it up with stuff I bought at the usual store solution. </s>
<s> Your reply however seems to have the usual question about how to get the internet to these devices. </s>
<s> That's been done many many times. </s>
<s> -&gt; Since wifi seems to fail you and we know N promises more but doesn't always deliver why not the usual power line HD bridge? </s>

<s> Hello again! </s>
<s> I did some online research and have decided to purchase a bridge to create a wireless access point for my ent. </s>
<s> ctr. </s>
<s> My D-Link router will comunicate with the D-Link DAP 1522 bridge (extending the range)and I will hook up all my hardware w/CAT5 computer wiring. </s>
<s> This will enable my devices to go on line. </s>
<s> Sorry for the misunderstanding; and thanks again for your help... Tom </s>
<s> I have the Netgear wps606 which I was so happy with I bought a second one. </s>
<s> This type of device is really great. </s>
<s> I paid 25 for it refurb and know why. </s>
<s> The setup instructions would cause most to return it but you can imagine I worked with it and it was just the thing for my kid's 360 and PC bridge. </s>
<s> The xbox 360 wifi runs 99 bucks. </s>
<s> For much less I got the PC and 360 on the air. </s>
