I seem to be replacing my external USB hard drives too often because I outgrow them.
Is there a way, via hardware or software, to make two 750G hard drives act as one 1.5T drive?
I just bought both of these recently and have already outgrown each as an individual drive.
I need more storage for my iTunes library.
I have already researched splitting my library and found that it is not the best solution for me.
Thanks.
