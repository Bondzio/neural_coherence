1.1.1	I'm planning on building a gaming PC within the next two weeks.	St
1.1.2	I don't want to spend too much money ($1000 limit).	St
1.1.3	I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900.	St
1.1.4	I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000.	St
1.1.5	Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2?	St
1.1.6	I heard it's only 1% faster.	St
1.2.1	and bragging rights	St
1.3.1	actually the socket 939 configuration came to $950	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	DDR2 RAM will run a tad bit faster than DDR, but it's not enough to really notice a difference.	St
1.5.2	And it's only if you get DDR2 that's running at a high enough frequency, at that.	St
1.5.3	Really, AM2 is just a backstop until K8L comes out in about 2 years.	St
1.5.4	AM2 processors are going to use less power, so if that's something you're concerned about, go with the AM2 system.	St
1.5.5	Otherwise, honestly, it's really not going to matter too much.	St
