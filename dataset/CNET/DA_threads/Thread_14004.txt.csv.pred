1.1.1	I was going to post this in the Norton Forum, but they wont let you post anything unless it relates to having a problem with their products, so I'll give this to any Software Developer: Over the past 20 years Ive been able to recover fried HDD's simply by powering it on and off multiple times, sometimes 20 or 30 times.	St
1.1.2	It would be nice if a developer would automate this process, perhaps as part of their existing HDD diagnostic software.	St
1.1.3	The software would have to power on the drive, wait to verify access or no bad error messages, and if fails power off for 30 seconds.	St
1.1.4	Its a simple program, but but it needs to be put in place.	St
1.1.5	(Im still waiting for them to develop a device that will gently slam a HDD on a countertop repeatedly [because that sometimes works!]	St
1.1.6	heh heh)	St
1.2.1	what exactly does that mean?	St
1.2.2	I have an external hard drive that has a broken motor (I'm pretty sure).	St
1.2.3	I've tried everything.	St
1.2.4	Do you think repeatedly connecting to power wouold do any good at all?	St
1.2.5	I am seriously considering slamming it on something.	St
1.3.1	does that include connecting it to an internal port in the PC?	St
1.3.2	I'd think a broken motor would cause a distinctive sound or lack of one.	St
1.3.3	There is the old freezer method which I've never tried and skeptical of anyway but I've heard others swear it works.	St
1.4.1	and I also tried the freezer method, which also didn't work.	St
1.4.2	It does make a distinctive noise... an intermittent beeping which is supposedly the sign of a damaged motor for Maxtor drives.	St
1.4.3	So I guess I am out of luck.	St
1.4.4	I'd really like to get the data back, but not enough to want to pay a retrieval service big bucks.	St
1.4.5	Maybe I WILL try slamming it.	St
1.4.6	Thanks.	St
1.5.1	I have personally experienced that this method sometimes works and sometimes doesnt.	St
1.5.2	But its always worth a few tries.	St
1.6.1	Its always best to submit such drives to data recovery experts.	St
1.6.2	Absent that, you can always buy a working used replica of your drive and very carefully swap-out the data disks.	St
