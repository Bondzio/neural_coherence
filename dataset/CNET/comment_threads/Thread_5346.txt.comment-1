I have a really old computer running a web-server.
This was my experiment with Linux, and it was successful.
This old computer is an Acer Aspire (1997).
Because this computer runs 24X7, I want to estimate its power consumption, to calculate how much I pay for the electricity it consumes.
The specs are: - Intel pentium MMX 166 MHz (Consumes 2.9 Watts, source: http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/prodbref/273209.htm ) - 72 MB SIMM RAM (two modules) - 1GB Fujitsu HDD 5200 RPM - Unknown motherboard (presume 1997 build) - No graphics accelerator - Network card: D-Link DFE 530TX+ - Startech 2-port PCI USB card (Never in use) - 8X CDROM drive (never in use) - 1.44 inch Floppy drive (never in use) - One processor fan - One Power supply fan - Monitor: 15 inch CRT monitor permanently turned off - One power indicator LED (green/orange) Can someone help me in getting a trustworthy estimate of power consumption of individual components?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
