<s> I have a new HP Pavilion which has a system restore partition. </s>
<s> I have already made my recovery Tools CD and System Restore DVDs. </s>
<s> Is there any reason to keep the partition? </s>
<s> And, conversely, is there any reason not to? </s>
<s> Alan: On the HP machines it contains the Recovery Console for XP. </s>
<s> It's a repair tool which you may need at some future time. </s>
<s> Although you could reinstall it from the recovery cd's, you would have to format the drive and reinstall everything. </s>
<s> Best to live with it in it's present form. </s>
