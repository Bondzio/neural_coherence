Can you plug an unpowered USB hub into one of those usb to ac adapters then transfer data between things on the ports on it?
Basically, I need to get extra power to my external hard drive that my Raspberry Pi can't supply, but still want to transfer data between the two.
That would be cheaper than a powered usb hub.
Just wondering if someone has tried it and if it works.
