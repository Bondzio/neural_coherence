<s> What is the difference between an external drive and a network drive? </s>
<s> Also, is it better to buy a pogoplug to convert an external drive I already have, or to buy a network drive? </s>
<s> I have two computers, one running Vista and another running Windows XP that I want to have the ability to store files on the external drive via my home network. </s>
<s> Almost every network drive I've used runs much slower than some attached USB drive. </s>
<s> And since we can share this drive on the network, I don't have to put it on some network and suffer the slow speed on my machine. </s>

<s> Bob, I don't understand. </s>
<s> You say you can share the USB drive on the network, but you don't have to put it on some network and suffer the slow speed. </s>
<s> What do you do? </s>
<s> Connect it via a USB port to whichever computer you are using? </s>
<s> Sounds rather awkward? </s>

<s> YOUR CHOICE. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Put the drive on your machine and share it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Put the drive on some network adapter. </s>
<s> Not awkward at all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The difference between the networked drive and the USB external drive is that the networked drive is &quot;shared&quot; over the LAN network and the external is a HDD on the end of a serial bus. </s>
<s> I prefer to use networked drives, it's much easier than having to pull out hardware all the time when I move it from machine to machine. </s>
