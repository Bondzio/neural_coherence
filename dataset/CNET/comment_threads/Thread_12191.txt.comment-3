http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-6.html Looking at the benchmark there we see 36.0 and 40.6 FPS in the first chart.
And looking at the rig they used at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-650-ti-benchmark-gk106,3318-4.html we see that you are electing for something more than a few steps back.
My answer is no.
-&gt; When folk want a gaming machine on a budget I have 2 answers for that.
1.
This Haswell value build.
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-7790-bonaire-performance,3462-8.html shows it trade places with the 650 so I'm calling them comparable.
2.
If budget is the issue I give the nod to the AMD A10 based machine with good ram.
It games without the wallet drain.
