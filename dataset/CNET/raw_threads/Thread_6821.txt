Adding main memory (does this help)? I hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)? Reallocating dedicated memory? Is there a way to overclock the chipset? Its a Dell 2400 with an 850E chipset and 256 MB 333MHz RAM. DirectX 9.0.

Adding main memory (does this help)? - any amount will speed up ur pc, but it depends on the amount set available to ur integrated graphics. I hear that using all the memory slots is more bandwidth efficient than one stick in one slot, byte or byte (is that true)? - ? Reallocating dedicated memory? - see above Is there a way to overclock the chipset? - why would you do that to integrated graphics? thats pointless. konny
