I want to set up my home network to run a DLNA server for videos, music, etc. I know that there are many new routers and NAS devices out there that now have the capability to run a DLNA server built-in. My question is, which would provide a better DLNA server: one that is built into the router or one that is built into the NAS device?

Well there is one that frequents the forums but I suspect they are here to disagree at times. To answer your question you would have to test both and see if they deliver what you expected. For example, many expected fast forward and rewind to work but (surprise?), that's not in the basic DLNA specs. Bob

USB3 works well with 802.11n wifi - you wont get much better unless you use a wired gigabit setup...but do you really want the clutter? I use the netgear N600 ADSL2+ router/modem, with my bravia and boxee (on older tv) - I have no complaints. Why dont I use a NAS - getting a decent NAS is too costly to be feasible.
