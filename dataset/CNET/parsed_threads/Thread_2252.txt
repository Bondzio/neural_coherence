<s> Im planning on buying a 1tb external to use between my vista system and my iMac running leopard 10.5.3. </s>
<s> I will be using lots of file storage for the drive as well as doing video editing on my mac. </s>
<s> So i will going between the two systems often. </s>
<s> I plan on getting a drive with multi functionality so i can use eSata with my pc and firewire 400 on my imac. </s>
<s> What is the best way to format drive for full use and or compatibility on both os. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Where's your 1 Tb backup? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I've decided and ordered the Seagate FreeAgent Pro, which has usb2, esata, and firewire 400. </s>
<s> Why do you ask, the type of drive shouldn't make a difference with how its formatted. </s>
<s> The best I've seen is to use NTFS so the PC can deal with it and add MACFUSE on the Apple so it can too. </s>
<s> so macfuse will make my ntfs formatted drive work with full compatibility on my mac? </s>
<s> We see far too many people here putting things on an external hard disk and losing all (or having to pay for recovery) when it breaks down, because they forget making a backup and trust the drive will live forever. </s>
<s> Which it doesn't. </s>
<s> So, if you've got 1 Tb of data, it makes sense to have another 1 Tb somewhere for your backup. </s>
<s> That's 40 BlueRay DVD's or a professional tape drive with tapes or a second hard disk. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> But did you look at it? </s>
<s> Better yet, did you try? </s>
<s> well i can't try anything yet because i am yet to receive the hard drive </s>
<s> NIL </s>
