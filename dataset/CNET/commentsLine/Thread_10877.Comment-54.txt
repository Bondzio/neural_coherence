disk life is not the exact science that the manufacturers claim and seems to be an educated guess from my personal experience.
i have known normal hard drives both 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; fail after only a few years, typically 3-4 years running an operating system like windows problems can start to occur, but i have also known hdd's that are fine after 5-6 years in this environment.
my intel solid state drive has windows 7 64 bit installed on it, before that windows vista, and has been in constant use for 3 years and is still healthy, so i think these reliability questions are now more brand specific, from peoples individual experiences with these companies and there products, as to how well designed and manufactured they are?
i think someone should create a chart so people can tick of the role they used the drive for i.e os, file applications, storage - years in use - compatibility, and any fails.
this would be good is it was done for all storage media though and not just ssd's.
that way people would really know what they were getting.
