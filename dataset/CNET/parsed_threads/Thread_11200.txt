<s> Okay I think its a stupid question but I need to settle this with my brother because hes paranoid about getting a virus... </s>
<s> If I connect the cable modem directly to an infected computer for 10 minutes. </s>
<s> Then disconnect from that infected computer. </s>
<s> Then Connect the cable modem to the router we have and have our 2 clean computer connect to the router. </s>
<s> Can the cable modem store a virus from the first computer and then transfer the virus to the 2 clean ones? </s>
<s> Keep in mind the infected computer was never connected to the router and still isnt. </s>
<s> It was only connected directly to the cable modem directly for a short period of time. </s>
<s> Any responses would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The cable modem has no storage or processor. </s>
<s> There's no way any virus can infect a modem. </s>
<s> Viruses only reside on computers. </s>
<s> If you dive deep into most cable modems the firmware and such is controlled by your cable co. </s>
<s> So for it to catch a virus means that it would currently have to originate from your network provider. </s>
<s> As of now, there is no other known way to &quot;infect&quot; a cable modem. </s>
