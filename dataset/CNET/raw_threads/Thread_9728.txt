Maybe if they were to make a macbookpro 17in for the same price as the 17inch powerbook then it'd be okay but if they cant do that then they should just put the intel into the powerbook and call it even, although having a camera and frontrow would be nice, wouldnt it?

Although that'd be okay im not completeley sure thats whats going to happen cause @ mac world Jobs said they were going to move their whole product line over to intel. but i might be misreading it. cause he did reveal the MacBook Pro after saying they had been trying to &quot;shoe horn&quot; a g5 into the powerbooks. so i guess my question is, is it possible their adding intel to the powerbooks? sorry to ramble peace out

The move is toward the Intel processor for ALL the Mac line. PM G5's will probably go when Intel has a processor that is as good as the Quad G5's. By 2007 there will be no IBM driven Mac's coming off the assembly line P
