<s> I want to buy one of these cases could you please tell me the differences between the cases: Obsidian 650d vs Obsidian 550d vs carbide 400R, thank you </s>
<s> Size, venting, looks and features. </s>
<s> And a tip about buying. </s>
<s> If the seller will not talk to you and answer questions, then you should shop elsewhere. </s>

<s> http://www.corsair.com/en/pc-cases/obsidian-series-pc-case.html Right there I see one has a silencing feature. </s>
<s> Your post seems to omit what you know and what is important to you. </s>
<s> Frankly (again) why would you want a 200 buck case? </s>
<s> You didn't tell. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I would see whether i want a $200 case or not, depending on the whether the added features it has has is of use to me. </s>
<s> Heat reduction is my main objective in buying a case because the room the computer is going to be in is going to rise to 31 degrees celsius. </s>
<s> The manufacturers page is not clear at all, it looks as though you can put more fans in the 400r than the 550d or 650d, If someone could please just list the differences that would be great and that is all I am asking for. </s>
<s> Silencing cases are usually not as good at cooling. </s>
<s> And your 31C is not good either. </s>
<s> It sounds to me that you'll get some case and then leave the side cover off like most folk when they can't be in a cool room. </s>
