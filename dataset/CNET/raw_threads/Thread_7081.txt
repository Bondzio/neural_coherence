They gave me a free motorola modem. And becuase i have two computers, i connected a router (belking wireless 54g o 54Mbps, i don't know exactly). It worked perfectly at first, but a month ago, for some unkown reason, my router stoped working peoperly. i would have to take the main router plug out every half an hour and put it in after 5 mins to make it work fast. although the router would be slow, my computer said it caught 100MBPS speed. After getting tired of doing that, i got a faster better router. I got netgear 108mbps wireless router with firewall. When i was trying to install the router(i took my belkin out and connected my pc directly to the modem), the netgear softwae would sense the sped at first but it would perform the step again and it wouldn't sense the internet. Therefore, i connected my pc to the router and everything went fine. and after following the steps,my netgear router was finally connected and the belkin was out of order now. Although, the netgear router it really really slow. slower than the belikn would get after 30/60 mins.!! but my PC would sense 100Mbps iternet speed. Can someone tell me what the peroblem is? thanx in advance

New MAC addresses of the modem and router have to be set with the ISP before the Internet will work. As far as a speed loss, newer firmware and a search for Spyware may help.
