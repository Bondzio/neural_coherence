they would eat up any profit on the cost and frequency of consumables.
many of my clients are changing toner when they are nowhere near half the number of pages that hp quotes with the same coverage.
the first thing to do is to determine whether you need postscript or not.
genuine adobe postscript printers are expensive, while others will have a &quot;postscript translator&quot; which isn't as good, especially when printing postscript fonts.
second, try to get test prints from the printers you are considering.
if possible arrange a demo so that you can test the paper you want to use in them.
some printers are very finicky about what paper you can use in them due to the fuser.
some paper might not do so well in printers which run very hot fusers, so check that out.
if you buy a printer without doing that you may end up having to buy very expensive paper to get the results you want on it and that might kill your pricing.
third, find out how much consumables, maintenance and service are going to cost you.
show samples of what you want to do on it so that the reps can give you an accurate cost per page, that way you have a starting point on what your costs are going to be on printing.
hope that helped.
