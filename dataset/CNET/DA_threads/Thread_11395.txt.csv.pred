1.1.1	I bought a used Compaq Deskpro P3 700MHz without a hard disk .	St
1.1.2	I plug it with my hard disk from my old pc P2 233MHz MMX running on Windows 98 and when turned it on , it gave an error message - Non system disk .	St
1.1.3	When I ran the setup during boot up , it saw the hard disk and when I ran Windows xp install , it detected the hard disk and saw it had another OS in it .	St
1.1.4	Any thought what 's wrong here ?	Ques
1.2.1	when XP saw that there was another Op Sys on the disk ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.2	Did it ask if you wanted to install XP on the same partition or ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	Possible problems is because proprietary computers such as Compaq 's and especially the older ones had data stored on a hidden partiton telling the system what hardware it has and has the drivers .	St
1.2.4	TheBIOS may be confused by the different drive .	St
1.2.5	Can you boot up with a 98 boot floppy ?	Ques
1.2.6	Can you get into the BIOS to boot from the floppy first if it is n't already set that way .	St
1.2.7	Did the drive show on the boot screen ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.8	?	Ques
1.3.1	Yes , xp asked whether I want to install in the same partition and I did n't install it .	St
1.3.2	I just want to test whether xp sees my hard disk .	St
1.3.3	The pc did not come with a floppy drive either so I have not tried boot up with a 98 boot disk .	St
1.3.4	But the drive did show in the boot screen .	St
1.3.5	If indeed some required data is stored in the hidden partition , how can I overcome this ?	Ques
1.3.6	If I format the hard disk and install the windows xp , do you think it will solve the problem ?	Ques
1.4.1	What slave did you set the H.D to run on during installation , try the Bios settings during boot up and have a look at what it is recognising the HD at , Primary , Master , then come back , it could be this , i had a similar problem not long ago with a compaq trying to install 2000 Prof over Win 98 , it did'nt like it , have you , or can you format your drive !	St
1.4.2	Mark	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	The HD is set at primary master .	St
1.6.2	I am using this HD in my old pc and since the old pc is too slow that I bought this used Compaq .	St
1.6.3	I thought it will work if I just plug the HD into the new one .	St
1.6.4	I can format the HD and install windows again if it is necessary , I am just too lazy to install everything back to it .	St
1.6.5	Beside I am not sure whether I will get the same error after the re-installation .	St
1.6.6	If things still do not work out then I have to give it a try .	St
1.6.7	But it will be my last resort .	St
1.7.1	for older equipment .	St
1.7.2	For the mobo drivers you should be able to get them from the Compaq website [ now HP because they merged ] .	St
1.7.3	You should also be able to find the drivers at the HP site .	St
1.7.4	This assumes that you know the exact model number of the Compaq system .	St
1.7.5	Possibly your Win 98 has some corrupted files which prevents it from being seen , but enough good ones for XP to see that it is there .	St
