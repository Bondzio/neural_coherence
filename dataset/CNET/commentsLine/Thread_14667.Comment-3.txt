you offered no details.
wag here, but goto the compaq support website and locate your model#.
there find the details for hd replacement( i assume new hd), that's the same info as adding 2nd or swapping out old hd.
in most cases, if no screws are present o open case, locate a &quot;latch&quot;, depress and slide side cover back or up to remove.
if you have a model that's a &quot;clam type&quot; you need to open as if like a book, spread the case open.
i hope this helps.
once again, it always helps if you provide details of your pc as much as possible.
