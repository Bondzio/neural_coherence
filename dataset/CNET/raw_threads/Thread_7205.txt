I installed a firewire card on my Dell 9100 today and wonder if I put it in the wrong area. When I went to look for it on my system, I found it under Network Connections under LAN or High Speed Internet.... Is this right or should I move it to a new slot? I haven't tried hooking my camcorder yet. Also being a 32 bit card, will it work ok in my computer even though it is 64 bit? Thank you for any help
