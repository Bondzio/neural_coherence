1.1.1	Hello , I have recently acquired a WesternDigital Caviar hard drive with an ADS USB enclosure .	St
1.1.2	After connecting the drive to the case , setting it to Master and plugging it into my USB2.0 port , Windows reports a USB Mass Storage Device , Disk Drive , and finally a WD313000 Caviar USB Device , which is displayed under & quot ; Disk Drives & quot ; in Device Manager .	St
1.1.3	Everything seems great but ... there is no drive in & quot ; My Computer & quot ; to access it by .	St
1.1.4	After searching the problem I discovered there was also no entry in the Disk Manager ( Computer Management ) .	St
1.1.5	The only place it shows up is Device Manager .	St
1.1.6	I have tried reinstalling the driver , unplugging the power source and/or USB cable and plugging them back in , rebooting , refreshing drive views , unplugging all IDE cables and plugging them back in ...	St
1.1.7	The drive spins up and even shows activity occasionally , but there is virtually no way to access it .	St
1.1.8	I have searched this problem to the death for over 3 hours .	St
1.1.9	If someone has some idea what to do short of buying another HD , please help !	Ques

1.2.1	If not , what you describe is normal .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	... that 's what I 'm trying to do .	St
1.4.2	But it does n't show up in the disk manager tool , which is what formats it .	St
1.5.1	There was a disk manager but be sure you are in the right place as noted at http : //www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives.htm If the drive does n't show up , then recheck your motherboard drivers and more things USB at http : //www.usbman.com DO N'T USE the front panel USB connections or try a few of them .

1.6.1	Same problem here with a 3.5 '' Hard drive enclosure , using WinXPSP2 Home ( with 1 gig DDSDRAM , AMD Athlon 2100 , plenty of hard drive space ) , got drivers for the drive installed , however when I plug in the USB cable , both in one of the front slots or one of the back , I get an error that Windows can not recognize one of my usb devices Neither Windows Explorer , nor Disk Manager show the drive .

1.6.2	Any other ideas out there ... ?	Ques
