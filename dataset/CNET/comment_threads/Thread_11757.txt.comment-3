However i have attached the old drive to my laptop and i can't copy the document and settings folder, with my user account in because it says access denied.
How will putting in a blank drive and reinstalling windows illiminate the problem i already have because i still wont have access to that folder because it is password protected.
Sorry for the questions i appriciate the answer i just want to be sure about things.
