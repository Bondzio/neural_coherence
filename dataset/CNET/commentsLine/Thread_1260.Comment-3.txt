very good point, hadn't thought of apps writing temp files and probably wouldn't have but you are absolutely correct.
this should only serve to expand on phonenet's comment though as those statements are theoretically largely true - until its taken wider of course as flatworm just did.
i am investigating ssd's as well and aware of the longevity concerns.
i remember when optical disks (cdrw) were seen as permanent archival solutions - time has shown that to be.... well....inaccurate.
for now i think i will use an ssd for os only (so swap, temp files etc can utilize it), once i settle on one.
with that in mind 128g would be enough for me.
