i started with a 20gb hard drive, and just added a 120gb hard drive.
everything is still on the 20gb.
i use xp.
where should i put files?
should i keep xp on the 20gb and move all my data and programs to the 120gb?
or vice versa?
any ideas on this?
one thing i will be doing is putting old hi8 tapes through my camcorder (via firewire) so i can convert them to dvd.
i would assume i am best off transferring these to the 120gb as it is faster and larger.
but should i move anything off my old slower 20gb hd; would my system performance increase by moving everything over to the new drive?
oh, and how would i do any of this?
thank you!!
