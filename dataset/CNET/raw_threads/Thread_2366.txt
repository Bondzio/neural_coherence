I keep redoing all the tests but nothing seems to fix the problems. I just brought it home from college and it worked perfectly fine there. I'm not sure how transporting it could have affected it but is that a possibility? I've had this printer for two years and have moved a couple of time since and never had this problem before. Any ideas? Thanks.

I called tech support and since i was no longer on the warranty, they wanted to charge me 10.00 to try and troubleshoot my problem. He basically went thru everything on the website to clean the heads. After 1 hr on he phone the tech support said that the unit needed to be serviced. The unit is on barely 3 yrs old and used occasionally. I went out and bought a HP. It seems that the print head is a major issue with epsons. I still have a HP 660cse deskjet 1o yrs old and still printing.

Many berate the printer companies for printers that only last a few years, but the prices have come a long way so some slack is needed. Do we really need to return to 1,000 dollar printers so you can get 10 years of use? -&gt; About your ink on the paper issue. It's this simple. Some ink is on a roller, guide or another part along the paper path. If you can't clean it up, then you buy a new printer. Bob

The first time I paid $40 to EPSON repair center and they cleaned it, but also said they did not find anything wrong with it! The second time I was frustrated and left it sit in a corner CONNECTED TO POWER BUT TURNED OFF. After two weeks I turned it on and it worked perfectly until I had to change the yellow color. It does not print yellow ever since, and I've been trough two cartridges so far. It shows that the yellow ink level is going down but in reality it's not spitting it out. So let it sit a bit. I will not pay another $40 to save it. It odes not do anything to superlative. Abandoning Epson is not a solution if you look for top quality prints at a reasonable price. The cheapest to operate seems to be Canon, and most expensive HP. Epson is the middle - price wise, but best in print quality. Good luck!
