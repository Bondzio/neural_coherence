My sytem spec is E6600 duo processor(2.40ghz,4mb cache,1066mhz) asus P5N32 -E sli nForce 680i motherboard & 2048mb ddr2 533mhz memory. I currently have a 256mb nVidia geforce 7600gs pci- express card, my question is would I be better off buying another 256mb 7600gs and running 2 or a 512mb version of above,and in time adding another. Will I see much difference between a 256 & a 512 or am I better of buying a single 8 series of some description ? (I have about 100-150 to spend) any advice would be appreciated.
