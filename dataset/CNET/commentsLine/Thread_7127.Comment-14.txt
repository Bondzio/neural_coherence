update i keep the d2346 off alot untill my nephew comes over & get's on it & now for some reason it's slowed down a bit.
xp is what i believe is causing it.
not the sydtem & hardware.
cpu is running real cool.
maybe i need to incert the xp disk & do the repair option?
scanned it with avira & comes up safe.
took almost 1 1/2 hours to get all the updates installed.
abit slow in my book.
hdd running good i believe.
maybe i just need to get that oem board & install my oem xp software that came with the desktop.
an comments are welcome!
thank's!
