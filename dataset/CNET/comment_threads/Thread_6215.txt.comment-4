When you install Windows on a HD on one system, it will optimize itself for that particular system.
When you move that HD to another system, Windows will try to change to accommodate the hardware of the second system, often with terrible results.
Another problem is that you may encounter licensing issues with Microsoft if the copy of Windows is installed on more than one computer.
What I would do: 1.
Install a new HD in the computer 2.
Install Windows on new HD 3.
Add old HD as a slave or on the other IDE channel 4.
Transfer important old files to new HD Hope this helps.
