hello, i have mixed up a bunch of pii cpu's on my table here and i don't know which is which.
how can i tell which is a 233 and which is a 650?
doesn't say anywhere.
just a long string of numbers.
also, if i put a 650 pii in a mobo that will only go up to 450 on a pii (550 on a piii), what will happen?
thanks - fj
