&quot;I know the Nvidia cards will work as long as the slot is 1.5v and not the old 3v slot.&quot; Please research this one and discover that the AGP card requests the voltage and there is no set value on the AGP voltage.
This is the area that confuses most as they try to verify they have a 1.5V AGP slot and can't.
The really old AGP slot in question won't let the 8X card plug in.
