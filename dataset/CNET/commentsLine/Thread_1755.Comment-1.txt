the on board sound on my ecs k7vta3 motherboard with amd xp 200+ quit working.
i uninstalled it and disabled it in the bios and installed a sound blaster audigy se sound card.
but no sound comes out of it.
i have windows xp pro with service pack 2. window shows the sound blaster is installed and working properly with no conflicts.
i tried a different set speakers and tried my speakers on an different computer and they work fine so i ruled out the speakers.
i have been building my own computers for 7 years and this one has me stumped.
creative was no help nor microsoft.
