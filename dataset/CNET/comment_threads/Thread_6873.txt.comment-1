I require a CPU for my Gigabyte GA-7VAXP computer, it needs to be at least over a 3.0 Ghz at least and needs to clock at the same as a 3 Ghz pentium 4.
I've looked at the documentation for my MoBo but it only list AMD CPU's and there aren't many that are fast, i'd search in google but i can't get accurate results and am not sure what to type in.
Thanks!
