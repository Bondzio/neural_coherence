The connector is a generic 2.5/3.5in & SATA connector with a power brick for direct disk power. I have had no issues whatsoever when using this in conjunction with 2.5in drives (obviously bus powered). Whether set as master or slave, upon discovery, the screen goes black and my computer (XP) goes down and restarts. This is a new one on me. I think for literally a few milliseconds there's a blue screen in there however it is impossible to pick up what it is saying before it's black and we're rebooting. I'm seeing a couple of references from around crash time in the Event Viewer: Service Control Manager (EventID 7000) The General Purpose USB Driver (adildr.sys) service failed to start due to the following error: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. And SideBySide (EventID 32 & 59) Resolve Partial Assembly failed for Microsoft.VC80.MFCLOC. Reference error message: The referenced assembly is not installed on your system. Any similar experiences or ideas?

By unchecking the box in System Properties, I am pausing the blue screen error before auto-restart: &quot;IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_EQUAL .... Tech info: STOP: 0x0000000A (0x00000018,0x00000002,0x00000000,0x804F6809)&quot; This IS known to be a problem drive - one for which I am trying to determine if there is any recoverable data.

It was indeed the effect of a virus that had corrupted the partition table which in turn crashed on all attempts to mount it - whether connection was in Windows or some boot level utilities. I've had some difficult disk recoveries before but this was nasty. Happily all went well and all files were recovered on both partitions before restoring the disk to working order.

It displayed the same errors intermittently, other times booting into windows but to no practical level (100% cpu etc.) and limited use in safe mode. Naturally (and fortunately) I have an image and spare disk for the test machine. Quickly restored and sobered by the infection, I changed tack/came to my senses with jumper settings CS w/CLJ and managed to mount one partition for long enough to rebuild the PT and snag the vital files. The device still wasn't recognised in other environs but another switch in jumpers opened up the possibilities with some other utilities to see and scrub all partitions just like a new disk. I could also just sense the disk was mechanically sounding just fine. What was the virus? I cannot identify but it basically seemed to have corrupted the PT to a level it was impossible to access the device without freezing the computer in this not uncommon way (hence the difficulty in tracing the core issue). I suspect it is engineered this way! I know very little about malware that affects boot records, partition data - not that I really want to have any more experience of them but I'm curious if someone can shed more light on these particular symptoms.

Why not discuss this in out Virus and Security Alerts forum here; http://forums.cnet.com/5204-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&tag=dir.forum The experts are there, and if they haven't seen this before they would be most interested. I'm intrigued you discovered this when booting up into Linux. Do you think this was a Linux infection then? Mark

My assumption, and it is only an assumption, is that my test machine NTFS disk was exposed at this point and no other that I can estimate. That one disk has a partition failure is no reason to conclude virus. That these absolute partition failures, which I have never before encountered, now happen together, in this manner, and in this sequence of events - this kind of contagious hardware failure is too much coincidence for me. On top of that, I have before encountered the effect of malware that prevents the start-up of key windows services in normal start-up mode, hogging the CPU, whilst in safe mode, the disk is fine but AV resident shield was not loaded and 'locked out'. No network connections possible. This is the same - the partition business is a new one to me but I've read about it. My objective was to recover irreplacable files and, if possible, the disk - which I did. Alas for the sake of this discussion, the possibility of further research into whether this was a virus, and if so which, has now gone as I have restored the disk to good working order with a fresh OS install.

Upon crashing, I reboot XP with the DVD drive still running and there is no problem until I repower the DVD drive again. Seems to be a power issue.
