take a look at pinnacle systems usb video capture cards.
they start at $100 and up depending on the features.
i like the movie box plus at $150 for the better features and much better software.
at the least you can capture video to your computer with any of these and play it back once in.
the better cards will let you edit your video for a more polished look.
you can also google &quot;video capture&quot; for more options.
these can be found at best buy, circuit city or almost anywhere computer related devices are sold.
check out pinnaclesys.com for more info.
as for #2, almost any vhs machine can hook up to these cards.
what worked best for me was two things.
#1. get a capture card that supports s-video and get a vhs machine that also has that option.
#2 get a good quality cable!
this will ensure a higher quality of video on your computer.
i hope you find this of some help.
good luck!
