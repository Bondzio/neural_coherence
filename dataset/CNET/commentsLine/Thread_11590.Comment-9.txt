it appears you are going to learn this the hard way.
good hunting and come back in a few months with your experiences.
1.
16 hours.
i thought i covered why you need that.
in just a year with these 300 cycle batteries, you will have to replace the battery to keep that 8 hour usage per charge.
i had hoped this simple explanation would suffice.
2.
&quot;text conversion&quot; is what you noted about.
here's what you wrote -&gt; &quot;writing out my math in onenote and highlighting paragraphs in my textbooks with a stylus.&quot; how else would one highlight a paragraph unless the app converted your writing into text?
--&gt; i have these things and have encountered too many students that thought all this was good to go.
well, the good to go part must be vendors and industry willing to take your money.
