does anyone know of a way to make color corrections using the photosmart 8250?
i have read the brief manual, gone through the hp imaging software, and tried every way i can think of to correct the extreme amount of magenta the printer is using for photos.
this problem is especially bad with flesh tones--they come out a bright pink.
while i can &quot;guess&quot; and make changes with photoshop for each image, life would be better if i could adjust the printer settings to more accurately match the computer screen.
how did the cnet editor--who gave the 8250 a 7.4--miss this??
it's a major problem.
i'm beginning to think there is no way to make color corrections with the printer--i want my epson stylus back!
thanks for any suggestions!
