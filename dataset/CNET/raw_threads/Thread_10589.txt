Its a dell optiplex, do you need to know the exact model? its one of them old flat desktop ones. if anyone could help me out that would be great thanx. Dan

If not down load this software and post your specifications here. http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php I'd suggest a combo (combination) purchase like this if it's worth upgrading: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135082 Have you upgraded a PC before? If not you might just replace it with a low end PC for a few hundred dollars. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883114055 This is no dream machine. Read the specification carefully

DON'T DO IT. Why should I list the parts you'll save? But in short let's skip to what is the best update to get some gaming out of that box. I suggest you look at this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-cards,1805.html for your AGP slot then check the power supply rating and call it quits. The headaches of saving what may be the case, the CD/DVD drive and nothing else is usually not worth it. Even the OS may fail to relocate and many don't plan on that.

What you save is the case and its fans, the power supply if it's adequate, your optical drives, and little things like card readers or what have you. You also save the landfill from a pile of toxic junk. Often times the only thing really worn out on an old computer is just that it can't keep up with the demands of today's programs. A new mobo that supports modern CPUs and ddr2 RAM could be done reasonably nicely for under $400 for it all. It's definitely easier to toss and buy new, but since time isn't an issue here...

Many of the flame retardants are naturally curring substances that are non-toxic. Lead is a heavy metal and because of it's weight, it may not travel far from the landfill. This of course varies from PC too PC and the materials used so there might be some PCs safer then others. See the abundance of sources on the web about this topic.
