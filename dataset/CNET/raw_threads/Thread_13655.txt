8425	0	48599	577282	NR	Unknown	11/30/04 1:24 PM	1.10182104E12	Computer will no longer turn on	My mobo has always had problems from the beginning. Every so often, the BIOS would reset or I would have to reseed the video card because of beeps. This morning, I turned my computer on and it didn't boot. All the fans went on, everything clicked properly harddrives and all, and the system hung. I figured maybe the video card was having an issue again, so I shutdown, unplugged everything and reseeded the video card. I turn the PSU back on, and the motherboard LED lights lit up. I pressed the power button and nothing happened. Not even a 1 second fan spin. It was as if the power button didn't even work all of a sudden. I unplugged, checked connections, and nothing. I took out the battery, waited, put it back in, nothing. I reset the CMOS with the jumper, nothing. I took out the video card - nothing. What the heck happened? I'm much more sure that it's the mobo over the psu because the mobo has been giving me on and off issues from day 1, but how can I tell which it is, or should I just order both a psu and a new mobo? I'm using a 500V psu and an Abit IC7-G mobo. I'm currently at work and when I get home in a few hours, I'm going to unplug everything and try to do a bootup with just the CPU and memory, but I'm not very confident. Why would the LED lights turn on but the computer won't even turn on for a split second?

Exercise your warranty &quot;Every so often, the BIOS would reset or I would have to reseed the video card because of beeps.&quot; Further indications of a bad board, bad memory or more. Call the supplier.
