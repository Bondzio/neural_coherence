<s> Hello folks, My new year started with a weird virus infecting the system and telling me that my HDD is crashing, RAM temp too high etc. </s>
<s> It blocked my access to all files. </s>
<s> I booted my PC with USB linux and copied all files to external HDD. </s>
<s> Now I restored PC to factory defaults but this HDD health is haunting me. </s>
<s> I ran HDTune but I don't understand the results. </s>
<s> I have uploaded screenshots at http://imageshack.us/g/28/hdtunebenchmarkhitachiha.png/ I will be very thankful if somebody could read it and let me know if I have a reason to worry. </s>
<s> I really don't want HDD fail on me so if there is any sign, I would like to replace HDD rightaway. </s>
<s> The laptop is about 2 years old. </s>
<s> HDD is not making any weird noise but it has happened that when I am working on it, my toddler may lightly hit a laptop and it would warn me with a popup that it has parked HDD head to a safe location.and I have never had any issue with corrupt file or something else like that. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If I knew this laptop was running Vista on 1GB RAM then I would think nothing of the rather low numbers I saw on the graph image. </s>
<s> As to the heat, it is often the lack of maintenance. </s>
<s> I have to ask if you are doing your own work or having it done every 6 months. </s>
<s> Some folk don't know we need to give the air vents a shot of canned air regularly to keep the machine's vents clear. </s>

<s> This laptop is Toshiba Satellite A505, runs Win7 x64 Home premium with 4GB RAM. </s>
<s> I do all maintenance by myself. </s>
<s> I have heard of cleaning air vent using air cans but honestly I am too scared too do that as I am afraid that instead of getting the dust out, I will block it even further by pushing it in. </s>
<s> May be I just need to know how to do it correctly. </s>
<s> Yes, the numbers are a bit low but if the laptop is not getting regular maintenance with the basic simple canned air then what you reported would be normal. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The vent (air out) should be on the side of the unit, induction, (air in) is generally on the bottom of the unit. </s>
<s> Hold the laptop so that you can blow air through the induction input. </s>
<s> Make sure the laptop is OFF and don't hold the air too close, stand it off several inches and blow it out. </s>
<s> Mindstyle.. </s>
<s> The symptoms you're reporting sounds like they MAY be &quot;fake&quot;, depending on what type of &quot;malware&quot; was installed. </s>
<s> Have a look at the below removal guides. </s>
<s> Note where the first states: &quot; System Fix is a fake computer analysis and optimization program from the FakeHDD family of rogues. </s>
<s> This rogue displays false alerts that are designed to make you think that your computer has hard disk problems that have lead to corrupt and missing data. </s>
<s> &quot; Further down the page, there's a list of the false alerts. </s>
<s> Is it this what you're experiencing? </s>
<s> Are you being asked to pay for the program, in order to fix it? </s>
<s> Remove System Fix (Uninstall Guide) Remove System Check (Uninstall Guide) IF so, either of the guides should help you remove it. </s>
<s> If NOT, sounds if you have some (physical) cleaning to do! </s>
<s> Best of luck.. Carol </s>
