6465	10	105053	1210307	1209835	ozos	5/26/05 4:06 pm	1.11712356e12	on and again no	don't get the thermaltake i have the 420w in another rig, it's not bad from what i've seen so far, but i wouldn't suggest it, nor it's 480w cousin, for sli and what not i would suggest a pc power & cooling 850w if you really want the best if you want to step down a bit, the 510w would be fine also, on newegg the zippy/emacs 700w and 600w units would be fine along with enermax's 660w unit
