I was of the understanding that the numbers like &quot;6000&quot; were just superficial indicators of the max TDP supported, which in my case is 89w.
So I thought the 89w 6000 would be compatible.
Is this inaccurate?
Also there is a 65w version of this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103234 .
I'd have to purchase from somewhere else but they seem identical with the exception of the TDP.
Wouldn't I want lower TDP?
I'm still wondering if the bigger Windsor cache will yield the most performance.
Can anybody help me with this?
