8737	0	573653	5363400	NR	edweather	9/19/12 7:23 PM	1.34808258E12	We need a joystick.	Have a Dell Dimension 3000, running XP and have a Ms Pacman game installed. Using the keyboard is kind of a pita. A joystick would be easier. I have a couple of usb ports available. Can I just get a plug and play joystick? Where do you suggest I find one? Does anyone even use a joystick anymore? I feel old fashioned by even asking the question. But I know my 5 year old (and I too) would be happy playing the game with a joystick. Thanks. Ed.
