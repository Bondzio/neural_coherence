the last time i did it on an old machine like this one, the cpu came out with the heat sink(the heat sink compound acted like glue)and some of the pins got bent.
i spent 6 hours re-aligning the cpu pins.
so i'm a little gun shy on this one.
i'll bite the bullet on this one pull the heat sink off clean the old compound off and replace with new and with luck i will get it back together.
