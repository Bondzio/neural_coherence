hi what's the advantage of having tv tuner in pc?
i think, i would still need to subscribe to comcast tv or dishtv to get the signals and channels i need.
is this right?
only thing maybe, i will not need a dvr and can use the pc as a dvr to record/pause tv programs.
pc does not have a wireless card, so this means tv needs to be plugged to pc directly and pc turned on each time i want to see tv or use record/pause dvr features.
is all the above correct?
anyone heard of satellite tv on pc.
here's the url:  they say we can watch 100's of channels for free ($67 initial fee) on pc, provided there's internet connection.
is this a hoax?
anyone using this service?
how is the reception/service?
thanks rajat
