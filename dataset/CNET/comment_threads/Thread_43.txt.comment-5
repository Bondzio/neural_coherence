I just got XP home edition updated with service pack2 the video card drivers (latest omega)randomly worked last night however when I restarted I got the same error I have never overclocked.
BIOS is stock, as it came on the mobo, I checked ASUS website for an update however the only BIOS on their site for labeled as &quot;initial release&quot; so im assuming im on that now.
here are the numbers in the error 0x0000009c (0x00000000, 0xf7ac3050, 0xp02000040, 0x00000800)
