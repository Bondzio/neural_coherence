1.1.1	I have a motherboard that has 4 sata ports and 3 IDE ports for a total of 10 drives.	St
1.1.2	In order to power 10 drives I would want another power supply and a HUGE case.	St
1.1.3	I am thinking that making my own case would be the best option.	St
1.1.4	Any ideas on what I would need?	St
1.1.5	I need a material that is easy to work with and easy to assemble, as well as cheap and sturdy.	St
1.1.6	I was thinking of wood sanded with 2000 grit, wet clothed down to remove dust.	St
1.1.7	However the grounding properties of wood are non existant, this doesnt seem to be too much of an issue since I have seen cases of Lucite wich is also non cunductive.	St
1.1.8	I am confident wood isnt very 'static chargy' but want to make sure.	St
1.1.9	BTW, the dimensions of the case interior needs to be at least 40cm wide X 75cm tall X 50cm deep	St
1.2.1	&quot;silent&quot; wood case: http://www.silentpcreview.com/article237-page1.html Some interesting DIY ideas and mods here: http://www.extremetech.com/category2/0,1695,1638729,00.asp	St

1.4.1	I started on a wood case but I had to think about cooling.	St
1.4.2	A server case would handle your needs.	St
1.4.3	Material I would chosse aluminum, releases heat well.	St
1.4.4	So when all your equipment is runnig it would not take much to get rid off the heat that is in the case.	St
1.4.5	My next case will be http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811133144 Good luck Wendell H	St
1.5.1	Linkit, thanks for the link, that helps me in thinking about how to design it.	Polite
1.5.2	The metal bits I can remove from another case addresses the problem of mounting the mobo.	St
1.5.3	I have looked at ebay and did look through ALL the server cases.	St
1.5.4	I have tried xiode and zip zoom fly too.	St
1.5.5	Just not enough room.	St
1.5.6	I need 10 3.5'' bays for hard drives, and 4 for floppy drives (eei expansions) and 2 for CD ROMS.	St
1.5.7	I need it like that becuase eventually this 3700 AMD will be a relic but the mobo, with the ability to handle 10 hard drives, will be usefull for years to come.	St
1.5.8	With 10 400 GB hard drives, I could have a 4 TB server.	St
1.5.9	Thanks again linkit.	St
1.6.1	It is still bothering me that I can't think of where I found an even better wood case that I saw a couple months ago.	St
1.6.2	Will post it if I can get rid of my cerebral cobwebs.	St
1.7.1	I have finished some initial designs, each pic is perfectly to scale, one pixel= 1 mm.	St
1.7.2	http://www.geocities.com/strickjh2005/front.bmp http://www.geocities.com/strickjh2005/right.bmp Its very crude, and I think I will wait untill I get a new GPU before I finalize the drafts and buy supplies.	St
