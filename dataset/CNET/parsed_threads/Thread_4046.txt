<s> I have just updated my motherboard on a 3.0 AMD XP desktop and now have an embarrassment of opportunities for network connections; something I want to use, but have never tried. </s>
<s> My folder says I have : Broadband WAN miniport, PPPoE, disconnected, Broadband (dialup) connected, 1394 1 adapter, and 1394 2 adapter, local area connection 3 (nVidia nForce Networking Controller) local area connection 4 (3com 3C920B-EMB Intergrated Fast Ethernet Controller, 1 gigabyte LAN). </s>
<s> Which of these A) is most practical for Wi-fi connection to a Notebook, and B) would best serve as a physical connection to another desktop? </s>
<s> Probably naive question, but I've been slow to get into this side of computing. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, phantazy. </s>
<s> I don't understand questions. </s>
<s> Do you mean share files to notebook and desktop? </s>
<s> As for the physical connection to another desktop&gt;why do you want to do that? </s>
<s> Do you mean something like a server to client? </s>

<s> I'd likke to connect to a desktop in another room and share files and internet. </s>
<s> And a notebook in the garden! </s>
<s> I don't think you can connect to the internet through the desktop to another desktop without creating a dns server, you should buy a router and wireless card for your two desktops, and if you notebook does not have wireless capability, you need a pc card. </s>
<s> I'm assuming you have at least dsl, or else its not worth sharing internet. </s>
<s> As for the range of the notebook &quot;in the garden&quot;, i don't know it depends on the router. </s>
<s> This should be in the networking and wireless forum. </s>
