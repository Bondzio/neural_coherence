Hi everyone, It is the first time I'm building a computer and I would like to be sure thatt this setup is problem-free and relatively adequate for my use.
I'm mostly doing heavy Photoshop work with some Premiere work, and I'm gaming only occasionnally.
- i7 3770K - ASRock Fatal1ty Z77 Performance - Ventirad Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - Kit Dual Channel DDR3 Kingston HyperX XMP Blu Red, 2 x 4 Go, PC3-12800, CAS 9 - ASUS GeForce GTX 660 Ti Direct CU II, 2 Go - SSD SanDisk Ultra Plus, 128 Go, SATA III - Seagate Barracuda, 2 To - Xigmatek Midgard II case - PSU Be Quiet Pure Power L8, 630W Is there anything unneccessary or is there a bottleneck somewhere?
More importantly, is there a serious compatibility problem?
Thank you very much!
