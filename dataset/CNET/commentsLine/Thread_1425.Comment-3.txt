there are periodically studies/reports of repair rates.
the last i read for desktops had hp/compaq and acer/gateway as top.
they all flip-flop and aren't all that far from each other.
dell's pretty middle of the pack when it comes to quality.
world-wide they retain good marketshare.
my problems with dell were more a symptom of being mail-order, getting doa computer and having to ship it back, wasting a lot of time i didn't have.
the xps 420 and others in that line impressed me as being pretty complete machines and a good value.
