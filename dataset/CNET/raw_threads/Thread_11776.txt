Can anyone help me find a secure case to travel with. I'm a video editor and it would be much better than what I do now (carry around the factory packaging). If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks...

I found these two Case Logics, if you wanna look and let me know what you think... http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016OZ05O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-17 http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016P02WE/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-24

But we make some custom electronics and when we travel we can't replace our gear easily so we put it in cases we can carry on and will survive an 8 foot drop. It's all about the need. Yours is the fine case to avoid small bumps and drops. Bob
