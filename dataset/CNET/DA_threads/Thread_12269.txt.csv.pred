1.1.1	ok i have two problems .	St
1.1.2	first id like to say never had to deal with making a network or setting up a wireless connection before , so im lost .	St
1.1.3	one : my cousin recently brought her notebook pc to my house , and i have a wireless router and all .	St
1.1.4	so she goes on her laptop and does that scan for signal thing .	St
1.1.5	about 5 of them showed up .	St
1.1.6	2 of them were named KB43903496 or something like that .	St
1.1.7	then the others were actual names , like & quot ; ada , & quot ; & quot ; linksys , & quot ; and & quot ; & quot ; network & quot ; .	St
1.1.8	I assume that the names were made by the owners .	St
1.1.9	i was wondering how i would know which of the is mine .	St
1.1.10	and how can i make it have a name too ?	Ques
1.1.11	two : i tried setting up a network between my two desktop pc 's .	St
1.1.12	i ran the network setup wizard on one pc , followed all the directions , and then it says & quot ; now run the network setup on the other computers. & quot ; so i do on my other computer .	St
1.1.13	then i restart both pc 's like it says .	St
1.1.14	On one computer , when i go into & quot ; My network places & quot ; and click & quot ; View workgroup computers , & quot ; i get this error message : & quot ; Mshome is not accessible .	St
1.1.15	you might not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.1.16	contact the admin .	Sug
1.1.17	of this server to find out if you have access permissions .	St
1.1.18	The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available. & quot ; On the other , it shows the computer , and my other computer .	St
1.1.19	and when i click the computer icon , it freezes .	St
1.1.20	what am i doing wrong ?	Ques
1.2.1	Ok for the first one ...	St
1.2.2	The major thing you need to find out is how to log in to your router .	St
1.2.3	The way it works is go to a computer that 's connected physically to the router and open IE or Firefox , some browser .	St
1.2.4	In the address bar you 're going to need to enter the IP address of your router .	St
1.2.5	You should be able to find it in your original documentation that came with it .	St
1.2.6	It will look something like 182.147.0.1 Type that in and you should get a username/password prompt which is set at the factory ( and you should be able to locate as well ) to something like User : admin Pass : Password .	St
1.2.7	This will take you into the router and it 's configuration .	St
1.2.8	If you 've been using it already for non-wireless ... there 's little you must change .	St
1.2.9	You should have a wireless settings section , make sure you have these set up : SSID : It has one ( you said KB439 ... ) , so you can either just make a note of the name of yours or change it if you 'd like to something different .	St
1.2.10	For now , I 'd make sure you do n't have WEP , WPA , or equivalent security with keys on..because that will just make it harder at first .	St
1.2.11	Make sure that you have & quot ; Radio & quot ; enabled if you have that , and that you enable & quot ; SSID Broadcast. & quot ; Now the laptop should be able to connect , given it is configured to access an open dynamic DNS type access point , with DHCP enabled .	St
1.2.12	As far as networking both PC 's , do n't go do the same thing to the other PC like the wizard recommended .	St
1.2.13	Just get one computer working on the router , then go mimic EVERY setting on the second computer .	St
1.2.14	As long as you make sure that each computer is using the same Workgroup name ... be in MSHOME or something easy like WORKGROUP .	St
1.2.15	Also make sure that you 've enabled sharing of whatever folders on each computer you wish to share .	Sug
1.2.16	If you ca n't find one of them on the & quot ; view workgroup computers & quot ; thing , try searching for it by it 's name ( Case Sensitive ) .	St
1.2.17	You can verify/change both the name and workgroup of a computer by right-clicking on My Computer for properties .	St
1.2.18	Then go to the Computer Name tab ... .hope this helps .	St
