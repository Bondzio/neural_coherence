<s> I just installed a 2nd HD. </s>
<s> Is there a way to Power it down of shut it off untill I need to access it? </s>
<s> I am running Win xp home and its a Western Digital 200BB HD Thanks </s>
<s> Such is not natively supported, but there are some hard drive switches and drive bay kits that offer such functionality in the $10-$40 range if you shop around online. </s>
<s> Alternatively, just place it in a standard external HDD enclosure, with wide selections available from newegg.com and other stores. </s>

<s> External usb should not be any problem. </s>
<s> Thanks, I will check into that. </s>
