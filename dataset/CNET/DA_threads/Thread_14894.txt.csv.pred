1.1.1	Hi all, This morning, much to my horror, my computer did not want to boot up!	St
1.1.2	I could hear the fan running, but nothing was booting.	St
1.1.3	Well, I sorta take that back--one of my attempts at restarting caused it to try booting up from the cd drive, but that only happened once.	St
1.1.4	After that, all I heard was the fan coming on, but nothing else happened.	St
1.1.5	After some frustration and venting, a friend suggested a strange alternative--turn it on, do a hard-dump to turn it off (that is, hold the power button to turn it off), and then hit the power again, before the fan completely shuts off.	St
1.1.6	Lo and behold, that somehow worked!!	St
1.1.7	I've had the PC on all day today since then, doing some VERY important copying of files to my externals and elsewhere, just to be safe.	St
1.1.8	Everything looks to be running fine--no audio or video card problems, no processing issues, no stickiness of the system overall.	St
1.1.9	In fact, this is the first time this has happened.	St
1.1.10	So my question is: I'm pretty sure this unconventional way of turning it on is NOT the best and safest of ideas, so does anyone have any idea what caused this?	St
1.1.11	My friend suggested it might be a faulty power supply, or a faulty motherboard...I just want to hear from some others here to make a decision on where to go next.	St
1.1.12	I will also add that I use this desktop primarily for writing and internet purposes.	St
1.1.13	I'm not a gamer, so I'm not too worried about wanting/needing an upgrade to faster processing time.	St
1.1.14	Thanks in advance!	St
1.2.1	by cleaning out the case if it is dusty inside.	St
1.2.2	Yes, it could be a dying power supply.	St
1.3.1	Hello, I own an emachines t3418 as well and have worked on dozens over the years, seeing as emachines is a &quot;budget&quot; system builder they include some cheaper parts which lead to hardware failure.	St
1.3.2	The one I have noticed the most is power supplies, I would highly recommend you replace the factory psu they are cheap and will greatly extend the life of the system, the older machines especially.	St
1.3.3	I have bought and found many p4/celeron era emahiches all with dead psu's and dead motherboards	St
