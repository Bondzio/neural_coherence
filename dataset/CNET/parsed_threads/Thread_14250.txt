<s> Hi all, ive just joined this site here to see if i can get sum help. </s>
<s> I think i have fried my motherboard, there is no power getting to my PC. </s>
<s> I was tying to install my geforce graphics into my IMEDIA x2416 and i got fustrated and pulled a wire out from something which i assumed might be the integrated graphics card (it was a silver box which is not the hard dive, maybe it was the memory im not sure). </s>
<s> I tried to turn off the computer but the fans and stuff started going faster and then the computer went off. </s>
<s> Now it wont turn on. </s>
<s> Im asssuming too much power has went to the other components and has short circuited the motherboard. </s>
<s> Would i be right in assuming this? </s>
<s> Will i have to buy a new motherboard or can i get it fixed?? </s>
<s> I think IMEDIAs have a denver 11 motherboard. </s>
<s> Please help and advise, thanks. </s>
<s> P.S Im computer illiterate as you can tell so now jargon plz. </s>
<s> find the nearest computer repair shop and let them have a look. </s>
<s> Much better than trying to diagnose this from a distance. </s>

<s> Is that goina be dear u think? </s>
<s> Guy quoted me 60 just to have a look at it and see whats wong. </s>
<s> Can i not test it myself to see whats wrong, i heard one way is to replace each component with a working one and see what component is broke. </s>
<s> But i dont have spare components so is there another way? </s>
<s> If it is that expensive, why not research on a new rig instead? </s>
<s> Wear and tear also plays a part and if the purchase is only just recently, there should always be a warranty to fall back on. </s>
<s> I got this problem sorted so just want to let you know what happened in case it happeneds to any of you and your PC goes dead. </s>
<s> While i was investigating and talking to some tech guys they told me i should do 3 things before i take it into the store (because thats what they do first when they get it) 1. </s>
<s> Change the fuse in the plug 2. </s>
<s> Plug it into a different socket 3. </s>
<s> Take the cables out and hold in the power button for 10-15secs (this flushes out any static) Turns out i hadnt fried my motherboard at all as i suspected but after doing step one i realised i add just blown the fuse. </s>
<s> Problem solved. </s>
<s> Maybe you wanna pass this advice onto any noobies with the same problem. </s>
