i built this computer about 8 months ago and very rarely it would just shut off (1 time a month).
well over the last month it has become very frequent, randomly occuring more often to the point now it will only run for about 1 min and shut off and it happens while it is just sitting idle.
i do not get an error message upon restart and it just starts back up when i push the power button.
i replaced the psu and that did not fix or even help the problem.
i have monitored the cpu and mobo temps, they seem to be running between 35 and 45 deg c. i am in the process of tearing it apart and verifying all connections again.
im kind of at a loss as to where to go next short of replacing each component until the problem goes away... if anyone has any suggestions i would appreciate it.
