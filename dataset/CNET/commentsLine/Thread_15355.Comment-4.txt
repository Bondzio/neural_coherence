i tried a different solution.
first, connected the computer directly to dsl modem, i disabled the pppoe feature from the dsl modem, enabled bridge mode.
then i connected the dsl modem to negear router, and from the router to the computer, and enabled the pppoe sign-in feature in the wgr614 into dsl.
at the log-in for pppoe in the wgr61 screen, put in your sbc id and password (sbc id is something like twocats@sbcglobal.net).
the wgr614 was still set to be the dhcp server.
i enabled the dhcp feature.
keep in mind that after making each connection, i waited for some time (about 2 minutes).
after restarting the pc...it should take a few moments to start working.
when you go to 192.168.0.1 address it should go directly to the netgear router's admin page if you need to make any changes.
it worked for me.
