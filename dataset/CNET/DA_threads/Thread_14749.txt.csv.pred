1.3.2	a geforce 9800gt or radeon hd4830 will handle oblivion, bioshock, fallout 3, etc.	St
1.3.3	better but they will need a good 450w+ power supply (most HPs come with small power supplies.)	St

1.4.1	PC's game library is WAY bigger than the PS3's, 360's, or Wii's.	St
1.5.1	and dual Radeon HD 4870 X2's can play Crysis.	St
