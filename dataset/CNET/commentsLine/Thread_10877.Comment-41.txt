my intel ssd included a utility that actually tells you a percentage of remaining life.
i'm sure it's a projection, and i have over 98% left after over a year of heavy use.
i am curious to see what happens over time.
seems to make sense that this would work pretty well, as flash tends to tolerate &quot;x&quot; number of writes.
i'll still bet it'll outlast the mechanical drives on average.
