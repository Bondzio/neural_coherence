Some support my SDRAM and some support DDR.My question is , in order to use my existing ram, do I have to buy a motherboard that supports only SDRAM/100MHz or can I get one that supports SDRAM and DDR both including SDRAM/133? I am not sure exactly what specs I should look for in order to use as much of my old system as possible.

I have a P4 1.9 GHz Socket 423 with i845 chipset which I put together because I wanted to recycle some 512 SDRAM I had. What a mistake. It runs at about the speed of a 900MHz P3. You may as well just find some 1GHz P3 and get that speed? OTHER ISSUES! Your Power Supply Unit (PSU) to run this new dragon should be abotu 400 or more Watts. Bob

Your performance will suffer. If you are going the upgrade route, consider adding new DDR compatible with your new board. Between a new P4 2.4(533mhz?), new board and new DDR(at least 256mb) you will greatly increase performance. If you can splurg for a SATA hard drive that wouldn't hurt either. Optical drives, floppy, sound and video can be recycled (for gaming you might want to upgrade the vid) but that's another story.
