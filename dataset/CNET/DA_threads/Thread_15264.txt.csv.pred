1.1.1	I just bought Apple 's Time Capsule , which is a combination hard drive and an Airport Base Station wireless router .	St
1.1.2	Not surprisingly , the time capsule works perfectly with all my other Apple computers , but so far my wife has not been apple to access the internet from her Compaq desktop , with newly installed , Netgear Wireless-G PCI adaptor .	St
1.1.3	Netgear 's connection wizard recognizes the Airport Base Station , and seemingly allows a connection , but then continues to scan , looking for other signals .	St
