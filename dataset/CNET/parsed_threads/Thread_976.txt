<s> 1) Are there any GPUs available now that will allow me to take advantage of Aero (or whatever that 3D Vista desktop function will be called)? </s>
<s> Nvidia cliams that its GeForce 7 series is ready for Vista but... with Vista so far away from release, how can they be sure? </s>
<s> I plan to get a powerful GPU now and SLI it later. </s>
<s> But if I'll have to wait until the DX10 cards, then I don't want to waste my money now. </s>
<s> 2) What's the best way to connect 3 PATA drives with only two PATA ports? </s>
<s> I'll have DVD-RW drive, DVD-Rom, and a 300GB ATA-100 HDD. </s>
<s> I've heard that placing a optical drive and HD (master and slave respectably, or vice versa) will hurt performance. </s>
<s> vista gpu: you'll need direct x9.0 h/w support in the GPU. </s>
<s> on the ATI side, the radeon x800/x1800/x1900 series with at least 128MB of RAM will be sufficient. </s>
<s> 256MB will be better. </s>
<s> i would avoid radeon x1300s. </s>
<s> for nVidia, geforce 6000/7000 series with 128MB of RAM is needed. </s>
<s> i would avoid the 6200s and 7300s. </s>
<s> PATA drives: your PATA 'ports' on the mobo each support two drives with the proper cable, so 2 PATA channels support 4 drives. </s>
<s> retail drives usually come with the proper cables. </s>
<s> put the HD on the primary (typically IDE 0) port, and the DVDs can share the secondary port. </s>
<s> With this OS more than 6 months away and doubtful features, it's best to wait this one out. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The correct way is the one that works for you. </s>
<s> A long time ago it made a big difference to get it just so but then I could show that the &quot;right&quot; way was incorrect in a specific test. </s>
<s> Therefore, there is no right way except to tell what the test will be and then hook it up to do best at the tests. </s>
<s> Example 1. </s>
<s> DISK to DISK? </s>
<s> Each on it's own channel. </s>
<s> Example 2. </s>
<s> DVD to DVDRW? </s>
<s> Each on it's own channel. </s>
<s> Be aware that some CD/DVD drives will cause some slowing of the PATE IDE channels so to get all combos at top speed is self defeating. </s>
<s> Pick what you want to do and optimize for that. </s>
<s> The good news is SATA doesn't appear to have this issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I guess that's a no on the Vista GPU. </s>
<s> Damn, I was really hoping to get a GPU now and SLI it when Vista came out. </s>
<s> Maybe I'll try a 6600 for a bit... </s>
<s> I will try it with the two optical drives together and the HDD by itself since I'll most likely use the HDD more than the optical drives. </s>
<s> The reason why I like both a DVD and DVD-RW drive is because I don't like taking my DVDs to school. </s>
<s> Usually someone takes it and never returns it or returns it all scratched up. </s>
<s> I really wish this HD was SATA but $50 (after rebates) for a 300GB Seagate was a hell of a deal. </s>
<s> Thanks guys. </s>
<s> MS released final vista hardware requirements last week. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/capable.mspx </s>
<s> I read somewhere that DX10 games will not run on any previous versions of DX. </s>
<s> So, the eVGA 7600GT I'm looking at says Vista ready but says nothing about being DX10 capable. </s>
<s> And I've read that Vista does require a DX10 card but instead can be fully functional with a DX9 card given that it meets certain requirements. </s>
<s> Am I right in assuming that today's DX9 cards may work with Vista but will not work with DX10 games? </s>
<s> If yes, then it's more reason for me to not get a video card and use the money for something else. </s>
