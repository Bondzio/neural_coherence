I currently own the ATI Radeon 7200 that is PCI card Now I was wondering that is this card going to be better than the Intel 3D Direct AGP that is 32mb?
The onboard Intel video chip is using the AGP 2X bus instead of PCI bus.
I did look at the speed specs for AGP 2X and I noticed that the AGP 2X transfer speed is: 533 MBps and clock rate is 133 MHz.
PCI cards are only 132 MBps and 33 MHz or 133 MHz.
As you see the transfer rate for AGP 2X is alot faster than PCI so I thought my onboard Intel AGP will be overall still better than the Radeon 7200 PCI card.
By the way both the onboard Intel video chip and Radeon 7200 have 32mb of video ram.
I think the onboard video chip is connected to the north bridge so that's why it is using AGP.
Here are specs of my motherboard.
