I plugged my monitor into another connector on back of the PC and now the monitor works but I keep getting an error message after restart: &quot;The ATI Control Panel failed to initialize because no ATI driver is installed or ATI driver not working properly.&quot; What is causing this? Is there is special connector on back of PC for monitors only? Can I install/buy a new connector? If so, where do I purchase them?

As for a special connector....yes....and there are two popular types. One is for analog output and the other for digital. An analog type will be 3 rows of 5 pins. Digitals vary a bit but are also 3 rows of pins in a larger connector. You cannot accidentally plug a video cable into a port not meant for it. In any event, it's possible your PC had on board (motherboard) video that was disabled and a higher performance card added instead. This could account for no output from that port. As for your error message, that sounds like you just need to find and install the correct driver. It's a simple task if you know the model of your ATI card. You didn't say anything about your PC, it's hardware, whether it ever worked, etc. Knowing these details would help.

I did have power loss 3 times the other day maybe that did something to the video card. I take it I cannot just replace the connector on back of the PC because it's attached to a video card? As you can see, I'm not real technical but I am willing to learn and like &quot;hands on&quot; learning.

And, do you know if moving the cable to the other port is what gave you some response on the screen? It's possible that a port on the motherboard that's been disabled could be re-enabled during a power lose under some circumstances. If that's the case, that disabled video device may not have had a driver installed because it didn't need one. If you know you had a separate video card and could confirm it to be dead, you could use the motherboard video by installing a driver for it. What would be needed would be the Radeon chip model. You'd need to know your motherboard model or, if you could open the case and look inside, you might find an ATI chip with the model on it. Depending on the age of the PC, two common ones had been the 7500 and 9600. But, if it's on your motherboard your best if you have it is the motherboard driver disk. Any chance of that?

I'm going to have him take a look at it when he gets a chance. I don't really want to fool around inside the PC. I appreciate all your help with this. Will let you know what he finds. Take care.

In my work which is not specific to PCs, troubleshooting is at least 90% making good observations and the rest doing the &quot;hands on&quot; repairs. Hope you get this straightened out. Good luck.
