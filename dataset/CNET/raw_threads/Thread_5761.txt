Hi, I am buying an external hard drive and I heard that there are problem with portable hard drives not getting enough power from the USB port. And I am not sure if my computer will supply enough computer when I checked in the device manager in Windows it said my USB port supplies 500MA and I am not sure if it's enough to supply it without out having to buy a dock just to get 2 usb ports. Thanks Dell Dimension E520

Except the issue of tapping USB power for hard disks is one where it work 99% of the time for 99% of the people. You seemed like you wanted it to be 100% assured. For that you can't be so sure until you get the wall adapter for power for this drive.
