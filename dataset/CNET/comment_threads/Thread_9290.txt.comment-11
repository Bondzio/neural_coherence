Symptoms are as following: You get a message A:\ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the floppy drive and D:\ is not Accessible Incorrect function when accessing the CD Drives in Windows XP.
If you boot with a floppy all hardware works great.
If you boot XP with a CD in the drive you are able to read that CD.
The problem seems to be with Nero Burning ROM.
(System also has Norton System Works 2004 on it.)
I uninstalled the older OEM version of Nero and installed the newer OEM version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great!
I really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on.
Good Luck!
