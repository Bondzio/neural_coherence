While reformatting and reinstalling windows, instead of encountering Windows' boot up screen when first trying to install, I got a blue BIOS error that stated that &quot;if this was the first time I had seen this error, don't worry. If not, then my motherboard may not be ACPI compliant.&quot; Now, I haven't seen the message again in the last half hour of restarts and installs, but in the event that I do, what does that mean, exactly? The motherboard was only bought last year or so, so ACPI errors (I assume) would be indicative of problems. Basic stats: Windows XP Pro, SP2 - Motherboard's a Foxconn socket 775 model, but I don't know the exact ID for it at the moment (don't know where the manual is)
