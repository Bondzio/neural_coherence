It could be a setting, a question of available resources, CPU heat issue, etc. As well, how long has this been going on? Does it get better for a while after a reboot, etc.?

It matters as USB tend to freak out as they're serviced like any other attached device under the OS. While the PS/2 is a more dedicated one based on h/w. Check the bios for kybd. buffer and/or similar label. To quickly test the kybd. swap it out and check results. Kybds., do fail or become flaky from wear&tear. Also, if this is somewhat battery operated, replace with new one. You can turn the kybd. over and &quot;burp it&quot; by rapping it backside to loosen any crud or possible metal object(staple) lodged inside. tada -----Willy
