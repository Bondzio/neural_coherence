You need to visit the Dell support website and using your service tag#, enter it and find the exact details of what your PC was build as.
Then find any upgrades that Dell provides, but you needn't buy from them, buy similar from other vendors.
However, IMHO, you should chuck this PC if you really want this for some business as it already too dated and any upgrades won't really make it a swift or real dependable PC, it has to work real hard to keep up and/or become stressed.
Check your local Craigslist and find out what that PC is going for and then check what others are selling that maybe more upgradeable and/or simply better to begin with.
In other words put you possible upgrade funds to better use on a newer PC.
