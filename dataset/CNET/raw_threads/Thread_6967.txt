9210	0	229619	2381451	NR	bluebird007	1/21/07 9:07 AM	1.16937042E12	prob with keyboard	I have an old AMD processor PC, and 3 days bfore i formatted the HDD and (Tried to)reinstalled windows XP pro. I set the boot sequence in the Bios setting and started installing windows. After the first restart, i noticed I cannot enter the serial number coz my keyboard is not working. I restarted the computer and i saw the keyboard works in the bios settings. But when windows start loading the keyboard works. I tried chaging the keyboard and reseting the bios settings. Didnt work. This system was working on WIn xP with no trouble. How could this suddenly happen. Am using a USB mouse and a PS2 keyboard. Do u think its a hardware conflict. Does anyone knows how to fix it? Apreciate the help

If you posted your query in a Windows XP bit of the forum I expect you would get a quick fix reply.
