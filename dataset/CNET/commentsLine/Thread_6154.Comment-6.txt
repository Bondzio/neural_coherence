the problem was the power supply as mjd420nova suggested.
i'm not sure why.
i did find this  psu that is meant specifically for my model computer.
would you recommend buying this?
the only reason i'm asking is because i'm skeptical about any other psu working with my mobo.
was the one i just bought an isolated case?
