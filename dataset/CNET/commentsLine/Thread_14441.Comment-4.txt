given the details so far not much can be guessed.
while we all know that many of these drives arrive in the rather fragile fat32 formatting your post is void of that small detail.
there is also an issue of what happens if you plug that into someone else's machine.
if you want answers they do cost.
places like  may offer that answer for a price.
