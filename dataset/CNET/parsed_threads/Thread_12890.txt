<s> I was given a Dell FP1900 monitor. </s>
<s> It has a 19-pin plug for the screen [not for power]. </s>
<s> Of course this plug doesn't fit any port on my PC. </s>
<s> Where can I find a plug converter to mesh the monitor to the PC? </s>

<s> Ya. </s>
<s> Dell calls it: &quot; 24-pin Digital-only DVI Connector &quot; I assume this is useable with a PC? </s>
<s> But that end plug doesn't fit anything I own. </s>
<s> I found a vga connection under the screen. </s>
<s> Goes vga-vga no problem. </s>
