i am thinking of going wireless, and am just beginning to explore the topic.
one thing i like to do in the evening is get a radio program on the internet and listen to it in another room.
right now we have wires running from the computer room clear thru to the other side of the house where speakers are.
needless to say, we are always tripping over the wires.
is there a way to do this wirelessly, and if so, how?
thanks for any help you may offer.
