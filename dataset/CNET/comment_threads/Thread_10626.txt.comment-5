hello, well I think I have finally decided on what combination I am going to go with.
I have decided to just go with the GeForce 6600GT 256mb graphics card.
I had a look at the Asus motherboard that is the next model down from mine the A8N-E, which costs AUD$167.
THis has no firewire and if I was to buy an add in card which would probably cost AUD$30, this would put it above the price of the Asus A8N-SLi (AUD$189) which has firewire onboard.
However people keep on telling me SLi is not worth having so the DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D is only AUD$222 which is only an extra $33 on top of the A8N-SLi.
I have heard good things about the Lanparty series of boards so I think the base specs of my pc will be: DFi Lanparty UT Ultra D AMD Dual Core 3800+ CPU 1024mb DDR-533 Memory 200 gig Western Digital Hard Drive 19'' Widescreen LCD Monitor 16x Liteon Dual Layer DVD-RW GeForce 6600GT 256mb What do you guys reckon of this, Cheers Benny
