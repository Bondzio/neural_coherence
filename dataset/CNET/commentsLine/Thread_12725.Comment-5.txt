i don't really know what that (router firmware) means or how to figure that out... we did just get the router though.
i saw the settings on my router for the wpa enterprise thing that said it uses a radius, but that was not the option we selected.
also how would that explain the reason my desktop connects wirelessly and it doesn't support the certificate settings
