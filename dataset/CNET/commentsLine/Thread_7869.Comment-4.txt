thank you so much for your replies.
the routers gateway abilities should be disabled in my network connections?
i know hardly anything about networking so i wanna make sure that i am doing the steps correctly.
i have been battling with this all weekend.
you said &quot; in addition, dhcp and nat addressing gets turned off as well.
does that automatically happen when i turn off the routers gateway?
or do i have to manually turn that off myself.
i already ran xp home networking but i still dont see how it works, sorry for sounding so clueless but maybe i have the cables in the wrong places.
i dont want to be changing any settings if there is not need because the only problem being i just got it connected wrong.
i need more insight please.
thank you so much for taking the time to help me.
