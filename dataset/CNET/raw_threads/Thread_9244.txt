My DVD player/burner doesn't want to recognize ant disk I put in which includes DVD+R DVD-R DVD-RW DVD+RW and cds. I can burn a DVD in the unit using NERO but after burning it won't open on this player.It will open on another PC's DVD player. I can burn CD's on it but can't run the CD. I can run it on my CD player.I always get the same message. &quot;Please insert a disk into drive H&quot; Is there anything I can do?

Sorry if that sounds awful but anything I can do to get people to test out the machine with another drive sooner rather than later is going to save everyone time. And before you tell us it's junk, remember we asked for low prices and we got them. Bob

It not the HW... ubuntu sees it and functions normally.. so i'm assuming microsoft has somehow disabled these drives... help us fix this.. This drive is not cheap.. back in the day it was over $250 and since sony no longer makes them.. the prices go higher today..

I tried eraseing them anyway.. so now i hve 2 disks that report 0used space 0 free space.. and are now useless =/ Currently searching for software that will allow multisession burns.. mostly for mp3s.. I want them to be on a dvd so i can take it with me, but i also want to be able to erase and re-record if errors are present.
