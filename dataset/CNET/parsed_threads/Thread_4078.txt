<s> I need a new motherboard, I'm falling down on ATX Intel 775 and I need 8 gb ram support, 2x PCIxpress (For future crossfire use) What's a nice cheap one? </s>
<s> I've tried looking for myself, but it's imposible to find anything in the jungle of close to similar names. </s>
<s> I liked the P5KPL, but there are about 20.000 of them and I alwasy end up with a micro atx or 4 gig max or no cf option. </s>
<s> All in all I hope to take advantage of all the ppl in here that know these boards and hopefully you can help. </s>

<s> for crossfire, you'll have to get a mobo based on intel p45 or x48/x58 chipsets. </s>
<s> p45 is the least expensive option. </s>
