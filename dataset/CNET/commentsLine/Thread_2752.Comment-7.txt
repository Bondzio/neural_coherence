now you've uncovered my real agenda.
what will probably occur is, if all the hype around win7 creates a real demand (and supply) of touchscreen monitors, maybe by 2010 there will be a few more players in the market and competition will make larger screens cheaper and give us a few more choices.
hps touchscreen system got mixed reviews -- well, the two that i read anyway.
but, back to your original suggestion --- for right now, a good ol mouse is doing just fine!
