<s> i just bought a asus a8n-sli motherboard for a fresh build. </s>
<s> i have a few very knowlageable friends when it comes to computers but cant seem to get a straight answer as to which ram configuration is better- 4x512MB or 2x1GB. </s>
<s> one friend says i should go for the 4x512 because its faster that way because of duel-channel processing. </s>
<s> my other friend says go with the 2x1G because with 4 sticks my mem gets clocked down from 400 to 333. </s>
<s> Can anyone shed some more light on this subject? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> What happens sometimes is the CPU memory bus with all those parts on it has to take a small speed reduction due to &quot;bus loading&quot;. </s>
<s> I'll let you google.com about bus loading, but you get dual channel with 2 sticks. </s>

<s> your ddr-400 will run at ddr-400 regardless of capacity. </s>
<s> most mobo's have to run 4 sticks *slightly* slower (2T command rate) than 2 sticks (1T command). </s>
<s> however, two fast 1gb sticks may be more expensive than four equally fast 512mb sticks. </s>
<s> unless you plan on doing some *extreme* OC'ing, i'd go with 2 good quality 1gb sticks and tweaking them to lower the CAS and/or boost the speed. </s>
<s> here's a review of your board's memory handling: http://www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx?i=2589&p=6 </s>
<s> Actually, they both ARE right. </s>
<s> 2 x 1GB should run faster than 4 x 512MB in theory. </s>
<s> In reality, cycles on RAM make VERY little difference to the average user. </s>
<s> The largest (and ONLY reason IMHO) to buy performance RAM is to overclock it. </s>
<s> I'm running DDR500 ram at 1:1 3-3-2-7 at 2.6v and can run it up to 270MHz, couldn't even THINK of that with standard RAM at 200MHz. </s>
<s> If you are OC'ing a lot, then u need hi-perf mem sticks and want 2 x 1GB. </s>
<s> If u just want fast and maybe a little OC (like 10% of cpu clock speed) then 4 x 512 saves u money and should work great. </s>
<s> Personally, one of my reasons for spending nearly twice as much on my 2 x 1GB OCZ Platinum sticks of DDR500 was to OC them. </s>
<s> My AMD X2 3800+ cost me 380, the 4400+ cost 960. </s>
<s> I've got my little 2.0GHz running up to 2.68 stable. </s>
<s> That is a 11% OC OVER the base 2.4GHz of the 4400 at a total cost of maybe 240 extra for me. </s>
<s> Plus, DDR500 should have a longer life for me, as RAM speeds always go up, u are not likely to buy another puter that uses 200MHz RAM, but 250MHz wouldn't disappear as quickly. </s>
<s> Things to consider. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> Based on the info (below)...2 @ 1024MBs a looks like the the better, safer bet. </s>
<s> If you find other wise, let us know. </s>
<s> Seem to recall something about this in conjunction with earlier versions of the memory controllers in the Athlon64s. </s>
<s> BTW, didn't have any luck on bus loading ...you ? </s>
