<s> I have recently purchased a new laptop. </s>
<s> It is working fine, running the games and software that I have been using on the old computer just fine. </s>
<s> I then tried to run another game, and it prompted me to update my video driver, stating what version of the driver was needed and it even provided a link. </s>
<s> My video card is a radeon 9000/9100 and I found the driver that was suggested on the ATI website(and some even newer drivers)and downloaded it, then attempted to install. </s>
<s> It opened and installed properly, seemingly, but then it pops up with &quot;video driver.exe&quot; not found. </s>
<s> Then &quot;unable to install updates&quot; etc. </s>
<s> I tried all of the succeeding updates right up to the very latest version, all said the same thing. </s>
<s> I read through the instructions carefully and they suggested deleting all video drivers and starting in VGA mode. </s>
<s> Did that. </s>
<s> Same thing. </s>
<s> Same messages. </s>
<s> So I tried email support. </s>
<s> Told them all this as well as the error messages verbatim. </s>
<s> Their response was to suggest I check and see if the video card is seated and usually the reason there is a problem is because the settings are incorrect. </s>
<s> !!!! </s>
<s> This is obviously no answer or even an attempt to answer the question. </s>
<s> The card works fine, is still working just fine, and has worked fine on other 3d games. </s>
<s> I just need an update that will load and work so that I can play this game(which is one of the reasons I got the new computer anyway). </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> is choking on the updated driver, likely an issue with proprietary drivers from the laptops maker. </s>
<s> Check their website for any newer software. </s>
<s> Hmmm, try to update in the windows itself. </s>
<s> In the monitor settings under driver theres &quot;Update Driver&quot; button. </s>
<s> Click on it and see if it finds any new ones. </s>
