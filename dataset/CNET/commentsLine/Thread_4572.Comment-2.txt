i'm trying to do the sync feature (turned off the automatic setting) & it won't do it.
stays at 0% forever.
when i 1st got it a bit over a year ago, it was fine.
managed to transfer lots of stuff to it.
(though admittedly, i don't do it often) should i uninstall/reinstall or might that screw things up?
