1.1.1	Ok I am having a weird problem .	St
1.1.2	I 've never needed to boot from my cdrom but I have Windows 7 on a boot disk ( I 'm pretty sure it 's burned correctly and it looks to contain everything needed when I browse it ) .	St
1.1.3	When I go into the bios of my mobo to set the boot priority for the cdrom first it does not appear in the list .	St
1.1.4	What is even more odd is that there is a floppy drive on the list although my pc does n't contain one .	St
1.1.5	Is this normal or did I manage to connect something wrong and therefore it thinks its a floppy ?	Ques
1.1.6	The drive works perfectly when in windows vista so I am not sure what the problem could be .	St
1.1.7	Any advice ?	Ques
1.1.8	Disc drive : Lite-On DH-4B1S Motherboard : Biostar something or other I am running Vista x64 SP2 currently and would like to upgrade asap lol ask if any other specs are needed .	St
1.1.9	( I built it myself so I very well could have made a wrong connection when installing the drive but I do n't know )	St
1.2.1	But the model does look like a BD .	St
1.2.2	Since you paid for 7 , ask for the factory made media .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Is the Win 7 an original disc or a copy ?	Ques
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Well , you mentioned you have a & quot ; bootable Win7 disc & quot ; , that suggests it was made by you .	St
1.4.2	if so , then if this is n't a factory or retail supplied disc , there lays your problem .	St
1.4.3	While , i certainly hope you tried the disc elsewhere to prove it works .	St
1.4.4	For Win7 install , you do need at least a DVD capable drive .	St
1.4.5	Yours is BD and should have worked .	St
1.4.6	At the same time , re-verify the boot order and if it does n't see any CD ( any type ) then the bios got hosed .	St
1.4.7	While a FD in the boot order is OK provided it is part of the sequence , it need not be the only access to boot from .	St
1.4.8	Alas , if this Win7 disc is a full or OEM type disc , then again that may well an issue .	St
1.4.9	It either was done wrong or your PC is too picky .	St
1.4.10	Until , you provide the source or the means of how the Win7 was gotten , your support ends in similar matter .	St
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	Some specs : LiteOn 's second generation of Blu-ray burners is the new DH-4B1S .	St
1.5.2	Its manufacturers call it & quot ; Triple Writer & quot ; , meaning that it can burn all types of optical storage media currently available ( except for DVD-RAM ) .	St
1.5.3	BD-R burning speed is set at 4X which is a good speed - although not the best that you can find on the market.The drive can be connected to any PC using a Serial-ATA interface , ensuring that data transfer will never slow down the process of BD reading/playback .	St
1.5.4	The drive can burn BD-RE media at 2X , DVD+/-R media at 12X , DVD+/-R DL at 8X , DVD+RW at 8X , DVD-RW at 6X , CD-R at 40X and CD-RW at 24X .	St
1.5.5	Reading speeds are also set high , with the DH-4B1S being able to read BD-ROM media at 4X , DVD-ROM media at 12X and CD-R/RW media at 40X .	St
1.5.6	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I have worked on PCs with BIOS that had some limit on the number of devices it would show in the boot order .	St
1.6.2	I had to disable the ones I did n't want in order to get others to show up .	St
1.6.3	Go figure ... I could n't .	St
1.6.4	As for the mysterious floppy drive , I suspect your BIOS is n't set up properly .	St
1.6.5	There may be an option to show whether one is present or not .	St
1.6.6	If it shows as present and you do n't have the & quot ; floppy seek on boot & quot ; turned on , you may not get the usually floppy drive error .	St
1.6.7	In any event , see if your BIOS shows the floppy as present or enabled and change to not present/disabled .	St
