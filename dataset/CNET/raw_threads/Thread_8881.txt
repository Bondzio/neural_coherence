Please help me decide! I'm looking to upgrade it probably for gaming purposes. What would you suggest? I'm looking to be fairly frugal as well. It's an Acer Aspire E360 (with windows vista ultimate). I've added 512mg(total 1.5g) of ram and thats the only upgrade I've done so far. CPU is a AMD Athlon 64x2 3800+ The video card is a radeon x600 (I know crappy) Here is a link to a picture of my PSU http://img247.imageshack.us/my.php?image=nashvilleandrandom070lq6.jpg Here is a link to just about the exact same computer. http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/acer-aspire-e360-2/4507-3118_7-31749343.html?tag=sub Thanks very much for the help. Please ask if you need any more info!
