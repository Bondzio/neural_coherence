<s> I already know it makes it more accurate, but before I blow a hundred dollars on a mouse I want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother. </s>
<s> I just bought a new graphics card (GTX 560 TI) and couldn't help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when I slide the mouse. </s>
<s> When I run or aim I can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when I turn. </s>
<s> It also looks a lot smoother with a controller. </s>
<s> So can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher DPI mouse... or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there's no difference? </s>
<s> It should. </s>
<s> A mouse uses &quot;dpi rating&quot; in that it transverses the display it also counts on dpi to makes it movements. </s>
<s> If not capable it will appear jerky or snappy, trying to catch-up. </s>
<s> Also, since you have a better video grade you raise the level as all that follows must also be capable and/or measure-up. </s>
<s> This is not normally a problem, but if you push the bounds, then expect it to push back because everything is suspect to an upgrade. </s>
<s> What makes a $100 mouse, now you know and it may not always appear that way. </s>
<s> At the same time, if the mouse needs extra attention it may suck some cpu cycles when you may need them for game play, then I'm not a gamer. </s>
<s> Though, I fix many a gamer PC, only because they push them to the limits with a mix-match of PC parts, for what was the deal of the day purchase. </s>
<s> No downplay on gamers, but if you want the best from your PC, then install the best into your PC. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yeah, it looks like it does. </s>
<s> I borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out. </s>
<s> Before I used a wireless mouse because I'm using it on a TV and across the room. </s>
<s> It improved the performance about a thousand times. </s>
<s> I've already ordered a Logitech G700 (5700 dpi) and hopefully it won't fail me because it's wireless as well... </s>
