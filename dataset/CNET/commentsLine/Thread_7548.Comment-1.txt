the internal cd-rw/dvd-rom drive (crx810e) in my older (4 years old) sony viao notebook (pcg-grx550) recently started acting up.
if i insert any kind of cd or dvd into the drive it thinks it is an audio cd.
if i try to play the cd (even audio cds) or dvd the drive spins for a while and then fails to read anything.
i looked under the properties for the drive and everything seems to be okay.
i also ran diagnostics and it failed to find anything wrong with the drive.
has anyone seen this kind of problems before?
any comments/suggestions/solutions would be appreciated.
