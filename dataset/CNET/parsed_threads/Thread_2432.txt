<s> Im looking for a midrange card to play Battlefield 2 on. </s>
<s> Im thinking of a card between $100 & $200. </s>
<s> If anybody has any ideas please help? </s>
<s> I have a Ati Radeon 9200 right now so looking to upgrade. </s>

<s> If you only have a pci slot, no better card. </s>
<s> You need at least a 5700 for BF2 and thats the highest possible for pci and isn't very good. </s>
<s> If you have an agp slot, get a 6600gt. </s>
<s> If you have pci-express, also a 6600gt. </s>

<s> ATI x800 XL is about $280 and has the full 16-pipeline and has 256 MB of GDDR3 RAM with a full 256-bit interface: http://www.futurepowerpc.com/scripts/details.asp?PRDCODE=VCAT-100435502&REFID=PW The Leadtek Winfast PX6600 GT TDH Extreme is a good choice, but you will have to live with a 128 bit memory interface and just 8 pixel pipelines, and 128 MB RAM: http://www.atacbsi.com/program/print_html_new.cgi?cart_id=&Pagecode=1|VIDR&Item_code=VIDR_LEAD_66_GT&USER_ID= The Geforce can run in SLI, but I'd pony up for the ATI. </s>
<s> Both will work with BF Buy what you like or you'll be forced to like what you buy. </s>
<s> go for the 6800. usually when its on sale it cost around 200 bucks. </s>
<s> it is better than the 6600gt however junker than the x800xl. </s>
