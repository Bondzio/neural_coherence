a month ago i did three things: -disconnect one of the two optical drives -remove one of the two ram modules (now i have only 256mb on this system) -clean all the dust from the video card, and it was a lot, especially below the cooler near the gpu i then booted it and it worked.
it hasn't frozen once for a month!
today i wanted my 512mb ram back and put in the second module again.
however, when i turned on the pc, the screen was just blank, nothing happened.
so i removed the ram module again and now it works again.
is that ram module broken?
or did i insert it wrongly?
i know that i inserted them in a different order than they were initially (there are 3 slots on the mobo, i used the two on the one side instead of the two on the other side, simply for reasons of easier to reach), does that matter?
so, freezing problem fixed, i don't know which of the 3 actions described above fixed it, and i have only 256mb ram now.
