note: this is similar to iceman854l's problem.
recently i purchased the lacie 1tb disk extreme+.
the problem is that my computer won't really recognize it.
here's what happens when i turn on the hdd.
it's connected to the computer through firewire 800. when i turn it on, the computer (vista os) makes the sound that indicates a device has been plugged in or turned on, but nothing else pops up.
when i go to &quot;computer&quot; (vista's &quot;my computer&quot;) there's no sign of an external hdd.
when i go to the device manager and look under disk drives, the hdd is somehow listed in there, so then i go to its properties and it says it's working properly, that it is online and everything, and it even shows how much space there is on the hdd... but how the hell can i get in it?!
i've tried uninstalling the driver, then reinstalled.
didn't work.
i've tried to unplug any other devices but my keyboard/mouse.
didn't work.
tried to use usb.
didn't make a difference.
can anyone help?
thanks.
