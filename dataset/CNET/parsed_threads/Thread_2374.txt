<s> I own a Buffalo 1TB NAS I use for media network storage and serving on my Vista Media Center system. </s>
<s> The 1TB Buffalo LinkStation Quad has 4 250GB WD Caviar Blue internal drives. </s>
<s> I am looking to upgrade this to a 4TB NAS and have a few questions. </s>
<s> I would appreicate any help from anyone who may have already done this. </s>
<s> 1 - Does anyone know what vendor's drive that Buffalo uses in the 4TB system? </s>
<s> They package the drive as a OP-HD1.0T 1TB model. </s>
<s> Their price is way too expensive. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if they use the WD 1TB Caviar Black configuration? </s>
<s> Does it make any difference? </s>
<s> 2 - Currently the Linkstation Quad is marketed as a 4TB solution. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the Quad will support internal drives greater that 1 TB? </s>
<s> 3- When I do the upgrade I plan on replacing one disk at a time and let the RAID 5 system rebuild the drives. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of any other methods... </s>
<s> Check with Buffalo first to ask if their Linux resides on the hard disk. </s>
<s> For performance reasons, most consumer pre-configured NASs run disk-based OS and it's not easy to expand an Ext2 or Ext3 partition then boot successfully. </s>
<s> With their cost for thier &quot;Branded&quot; disk drives, it woudl be creaper to by a new NAS than to upgrade...HOwever, I will check on where their OS resides... </s>
<s> Keep the 4x250GB as is. </s>
<s> When you get the 4x1TB, spring for a low priced mobo/CPU with GbE and RAID 5 or 10 (eg. </s>
<s> Intel G31 or Nvidia GF7100 with hi-freq Pentium 4) and XPH or XPP, if domain, and build a Win file server. </s>
<s> You'll be happier. </s>
