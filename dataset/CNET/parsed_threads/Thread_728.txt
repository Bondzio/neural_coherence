<s> Hi, I have a HDD of 300 GB. </s>
<s> I installed Windows XP Pro and when I checked the size, I got 195.22 GB usable HD capacity and 192.29 GB HD free space. </s>
<s> Any idea how I recover the rest? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The original, SP1, SP2 or SP3? </s>
<s> Some other questions: - What does Disk Manager C say about the drive? </s>
<s> It should say there's 100 Gb unallocated if it really is a 300 Gb drive - What did you tell the partition during the setup of Windows? </s>
<s> To use the whole disk? </s>
<s> - What does Belarc advisor (free download) say about the disk? </s>

<s> The original SP2. </s>
<s> During installation, I partitioned the disc in half. </s>
<s> Here is what Belarc advisor says: 104.86 GB Usable Hard Drive Capacity 102.00 GB Hard Drive free space Now I'm using the Disk Manager of XP, created a second partition of 90 GB from the unallocated space, formatted, but still have unallocated space which I cannot format to use as a third partition (the only options right-click gives are &quot;New Partition, Properties and Help&quot;. </s>
<s> Here is what I have right now (from Disk Manager) 1- C: 97.66 GB 2- E: 87.89 GB 3- Unallocated space : 93.94 GB. </s>
<s> Still have about 20 GB missing (Windows XP should not take that much). </s>
<s> That's 7% and that's exactly what's expected between the two definitions of Gb. </s>
<s> If there's a &quot;New partition&quot; option in your right click, can't you use that to create a new partition (f:) in the unallocated space. </s>
<s> Then you've got 3 partitions of about 100 Gb each. </s>
<s> The right sequence is first make the partition, then format. </s>
<s> &quot;Formatting to use as a new partition&quot;, as you say, is plainly wrong and impossible. </s>
<s> That might be part of your problem. </s>
<s> It's unclear to me why 'half' of a 300 Gb would become 100 Gb. </s>
<s> Maybe your BIOS doesn't handle such a big drive correctly? </s>
<s> Do you have reasons to partition the disk? </s>
<s> It's not necessary. </s>
<s> Windows XP SP2 can easily handle a 300 Gb partition. </s>
<s> It might save you some troubles if you redo the install, delete all current partitions and use just one. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thanks for your answer. </s>
<s> This is exactly what I was going to do. </s>
<s> I'll just delete all the partitions and redo the install. </s>
<s> The reason why I want to partition the HD, is I want to use XP on one partition (C), Windows Server 2003 on the second and Ubuntu on the third. </s>
<s> I'll do a quick wipe out with DBAN and reinstall XP. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I just partitioned the last unallocated space. </s>
<s> Now I have 3 partitions: C: 97.66 GB E: 87.89 GB F: 93.94 GB I think everything is ok now. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
