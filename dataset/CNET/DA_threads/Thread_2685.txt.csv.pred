1.1.1	After reading and researching several home/small business printers and scanners, I still can't decide what to buy.	St
1.1.2	The scanner I am thinking of is the Epson 1670 Photo (comments?)	St
1.1.3	but the printer I am looking for (please help!)	St
1.1.4	would offer high quality color and text, have an ADF, prefer multiple colors so to only replace colors as necessary.	St
1.1.5	I would be using this for cards, invitations, letters, pictures (next purchase is 1st digital camera) mostly creative personal stuff but some small business things that I want to look professional.	St
1.1.6	Speed is somewhat an issue because I normally do 200 cards, etc.	St
1.1.7	at a time.	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.9	I'm just mind boggled by all the variations.	St
1.2.1	An issue that can catch most people offguard is that you may find that ink will have to be handy at 200 sheet runs.	St
1.2.2	When I do my yearly mailing, I have one spare ink cart before I print and usually have to replace all but one... Today's printer at home is the Epson C80.	St
1.2.3	It's getting a few years old so when it messes up, the C84 or the 6 color with CD printing capability unit is what I'll probably get.	St
