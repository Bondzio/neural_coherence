I put together this assembly - E6600 , P5W DH deluxe, 400 sata2 7200 hdd, Dvd burner, card reader, 900 case, raidmax 580 psu, 2 gb corsair ram at 800 mhz dual channel, all in all a good setup. But now me and my bro where thinking of 2 x1950 pro's, 200 dollars each. I need a second third opinion, i think it will be alright ?

As far as I know you cannot dual up the 2-way cards, but the other poster was correct that the 8800GTS will provide more rendering power (ATI's CrossFire doesn't give a speed advantage (per se), it gives image quality advantages).
