7197	2	112370	1277291	1277024	ozos	7/2/05 6:38 PM	1.12032948E12	Thermalright	anything Thermalright has will be the best aircooling you can buy if not, consider some of Thermaltake's $30 ranged stuff, or Zalman's 92MM based cooler (it's huge, and won't work with some boards) $20 for a HSF is way to cheap
7197	3	112370	1277574	1277024	wahnula	7/2/05 11:25 PM	1.1203467E12	My solution was a ZALMAN	Flower cooler with 120 mm fan that mounts on your pci screwz, ugly, little hassle but worth it. it's QUIET!!! Comes with a speed control for the fan , way cool...and did I say quiet? Use these guys they're local: http://store.yahoo.com/directron/cnps6000.html

However, the thing was too big, to use on the MOBO, that I had in mind, because the power supply gets in the way. So, I may have to put it up on eBay, or save it for another MOBO, I hate to get rid of it. It is sweet!
