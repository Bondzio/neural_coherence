<s> I am having problem w/ my WRK54G Linksys router dropping the connection to my Linksys cable modem. </s>
<s> My cable modem is on a DHCP network. </s>
<s> I have plugged my laptop directly into the modem and can surf fine. </s>
<s> However, once I connect the router back up, it will only stay connected for 5 minutes. </s>
<s> At first I thought it was the connection between my laptop and the router, but when I connected via a cable I had the same issue. </s>
<s> I then tried to log into the router itself via wireless and sure enough I was able to. </s>
<s> I have changed out the cable with a known working one, and that didn't solve the problem. </s>
<s> Any ideas why the router would be dropping the connection after about 5 minutes? </s>

<s> can be resolved with a firmware update. </s>
<s> Look into your Linksys program and then to the website to see if one exists. </s>
