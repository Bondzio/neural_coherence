the techs see a drop from the router on there laptop but not from direct connection to cat5.
what i think is the problem is the auto sensor on the wan port gets confused as to which speed to connect 10 or 100 thus slows down while trying to switch and goes into i do not know state and reboots connection.
reconnects fine for awhile then repeats thus all the disconnects and reconnects over the day another words lots of error code one's
