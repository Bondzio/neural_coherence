<s> I have a 3 port Via 6306 chipped 1394 card, which I am installing under XP Pro. </s>
<s> XP ids the card with its native Via drivers but also adds a 1394 Net Adapter which is disabled in Network Adapters. </s>
<s> It seems XP alone adds this networking functionality because the same card in 98SE and W2K does not. </s>
<s> I thought I read something about a patch which addressed this issue but I have been unable to find it. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> My SB Live firewire had a &quot;driver&quot; to add FW networking to the other OSes, but I think it's outdated now. </s>
