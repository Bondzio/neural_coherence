If you only need B&W output, then seriously consider a laser printer and yeah HP does good in this area.
There are other makes out there and just about all basic laser printers do fine.
If you still need color and an inkjet, then look at Canon models.
I would not recommend Epson or Lexmark as they're expensive to operate and when an Epson pukes, it does so expensively.
HP still makes a good printer look at other simpler models, maybe one that accepts similar ink carts.
As for a true reliable printer then also look into Okidata, more expensive but real workhorses.
