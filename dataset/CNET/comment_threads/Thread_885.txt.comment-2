I just went through the same problem.
No screen, only the fans race when I turn on the computer.
Tech support (internet chat line)had me disconnect the drive, pull out the memory, and listen for beeps but there was no change.
They suggested it was (probably the motherboard) but I'm not one to necessarily believe a first diagnosis, and I'm no technician.
I hope others will chime in on this as we are both in the same boat and changing boards without more definitive proof can get very expensive.
