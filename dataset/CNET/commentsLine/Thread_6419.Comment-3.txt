&quot;installing a parallel port pci card did not work&quot; they work for me on xp just fine.
but many don't know to dive into the cards settings to change the address to the old lp1 standard addresses and claim it fails.
this knowledge is fading so research what those addresses are.
(it's partly because i want you to fish for the answers since it will help you understand the problem in depth.)
here's the card i used last time -&gt;  &quot;configurable for standard isa parallel port addresses (0278 and 0378) for compatibility&quot; that's the ticket.
