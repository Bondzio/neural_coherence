I need help to find an inkjet printer that does borderless on regular documents not only photos, (I am making fliers in CorelDraw 11 that I need to print borderless) can handle heavy cardstock, give me an excellent quality on text as well as photo, preferably envelopes also. I have read a lot of reviews here on cnet.com and no printer stands out that much. I need it for a small office with a farely high volume of printing.
