because of some remodeling, my small business is being forced to move its server.
we are currently running on a wired system, so reconnecting the network will entail lots of time, money, and pulling a great deal of wire.
the question is, should we just go to wireless instead?
with speeds of up to 108mbps, i'm not concerned about throughput.
what i am concerned about, though, is reliability.
our office is about 10 computers.
will the network be dropping connections?
also, just how secure is 128-bit wep or wpa?
