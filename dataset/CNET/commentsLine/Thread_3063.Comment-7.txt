after sitting for and hour, the computer let me boot into safe mode.
it boots up, let me uninstall the drive, and i thought it would work, however, it didn't reinstall the drive when i booted into windows.
here is the answer to you questions: 1. yes.
that is how i knew the drive model, make, etc.
2. i don't remember if it did.
i don't think it did.
i might just wait to get the thing fixed when we get a new computer.
