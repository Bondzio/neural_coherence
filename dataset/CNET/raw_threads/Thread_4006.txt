14390	0	61732	732148	NR	mvandenberk	2/1/05 2:07 PM	1.10726682E12	Worthwhile Upgrade?	Currently, I have an Athlon XP 2000+ CPU and 512MB PC2700 333MHz RAM. I believe the CPU can only operate at the 233 FSB level. The MB is MSI KT333 Ultra. I am looking to upgrade without upgrading the motherboard which can support upto XP 2700+. Would it be worth the money to upgrade to the Athlon 2700+ XP CPU and 1GB RAM?
