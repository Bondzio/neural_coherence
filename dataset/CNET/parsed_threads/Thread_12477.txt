<s> I recently received two, ECS GOAL3+ MOBO w/CPU (AMD Sempron 3000+). </s>
<s> I set them up following step by step procedure for bench checking... </s>
<s> The first MOBO works fine. </s>
<s> The second, the CPU Fan starts but nothing else. </s>
<s> I used the same power supply, memory, keyboard, monitor, and mouse in each mobo. </s>
<s> Why did the second fail to function correctly? </s>
<s> Is it a bad CPU? </s>
<s> or could the CMOS Battery be bad on the second mobo? </s>
<s> This has to be done in order to be nothing is amiss. </s>
<s> Small things can be forgotten or taken for granted. </s>
<s> I would under these circumstances return the bad one and just leave it at that. </s>
<s> The longer you play with it may cause further problem(s), then they can blame you. </s>
<s> use the warranty and state one works and the other doesn't under the same test bed. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> After disassembly, I reassembled and rechecked the second Mobo. </s>
<s> When it still failed, I Then, rechecked the first mobo with same items and it still works... </s>
<s> Thanks, for your help. </s>
<s> I will get it returned... </s>
<s> I'd still like to know why it failed... Do you know? </s>
<s> Or is it more testing required? </s>
<s> (I am not a techie. </s>
<s> I just follow instructions well.) </s>
<s> Thanks for your help... </s>
<s> I can't say for sure as at this level its more of a close inspection type of thing. </s>
<s> I check the solder runs, and shorts or bent points, broken contacts, etc., that could be at fault. </s>
<s> You could swap the bios(if socketed) and see if that helps. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it just so. </s>
<s> Maybe s/h damage or the bios needs an update, etc., Some jumper or setting isn't right. </s>
<s> Poor soldering or similar. </s>
<s> Maybe a blown capacitor already, or even worse an outdated version/rev. </s>
<s> wasn't done from the factory, then look at the stickers/decals and/or silk-screened info. </s>
<s> really, its out of your hands as very possibility you couldn't fix it and would you want to as warranty comes into play. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Your recent input was most helpful... </s>
<s> Thanks a million... </s>
<s> The mobo is on its way back... Have a great day Willy. </s>
