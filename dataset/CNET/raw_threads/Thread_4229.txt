I have an IBM Aptiva 2170-831 it still in good condition, but some of my DLL files I have lost somewhere. What do you guys think. Do I need to do BUY or UPGRADE. H-E-L-P Thank you,

A typical upgrade would be getting a new mobo/cpu, more ram, and maybe a bigger hard drive. if your a gamer a new video card is always a must. www.newegg.com seems to have the best deals on parts.

Better yet, format the drive, then do a clean install. If the machine is satisfactory and the dll issue is the only problem, this can be repaired.
