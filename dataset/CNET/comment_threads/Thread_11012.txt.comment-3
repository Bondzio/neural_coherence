Thanks for responding.
Finally someone who knows what they're talking about Yup tried multiple devices.
PCs, blackberries, iphones, laptops.
The router is out of warranty so I can hack at it all I like.
There's no Jtag port unfortunately.
The antenna is a caltronics internal antenna, connected directly to the PCB.
There doesn't appear to be any break in the circuitry between it and the radio.
