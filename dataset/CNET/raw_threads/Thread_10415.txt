Despite their portability, I find them lacking in power. I will be dabbling in video editing so I need huge hard drives as well as a discrete (dedicated) video card. Also a bit of gaming, but not the high powered, intense kind. I DON'T CARE WHAT BRAND THEY ARE, JUST PLEASE DON'T HAVE ME BUILD IT MYSELF, BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE A WARRANTY WITH THE COMPUTER SHOULD ANYTHING GO WRONG. I ALSO DON'T CARE WHAT TYPE OF PROCESSOR IT HAS (AMD OR INTEL ARE BOTH FINE). -- I already have my monitor and peripherals picked out. Therefore the computer shouldn't include these. I decided on a 22&quot; Asus monitor. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Se...p;sku=A179-2204 Logitech G51 Speakers. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Se...mp;sku=L23-6335 And this wireless mouse/keyboard combo for 35. http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/Se...mp;sku=L23-7048 -- Thanks in advance

If you buy those brand pc make sure you save some money for a better video card and some Rams(if need) Most brand pc sell under $800 are include those onboard intergrate videocard. Once you upgrade the video card your pc will run so good..

There are 3 major companies that still make desktop (HP, IBM, and Dell). The others only do it as away of supplementing their laptop sales. I would stick with on of those 3 or go to your good/trusted local computer dealer (not best but/CompUSA) and tell them you want to spend $750 including tax for a decent box with a large hard drive and a full 1 year warranty. You should get a decent system without the head ache.

If you don't like that, another good one is the Lenovo H520. Either one will do you well, they both come with warranties. The H520 comes with Windows 8, a 3rd generation Intel Core i7-3770 Processor( 3.40GHz 1600MHz 8MB), NVIDIA GeForce GT630 2GB Graphics, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM at 1600MHz, 2TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive. The K430 comes with Windows 7 or 8, 3rd generation Intel&#174; Core&#8482; i7-3770 (3.40 GHz, 8MB Cache), NVIDIA&#174; GeForce&#174; GT620 1GB Graphics, up to 32GB SDRAM, 2TB (7,200 rpm). So in conclusion, the K430 is better in terms of RAM, but for everyday use, both will do you great for a low price.
