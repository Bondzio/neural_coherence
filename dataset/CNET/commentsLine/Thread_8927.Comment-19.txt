having lurked through this entire thread, i've learned quite a lot.
thanks for posting the questions and answers.
i have a much-loved (and amazingly long-lived) 21&quot; crt that has begun to do the almost-imperceptible but eye-frazzling flicker thing.
bummer!
from the threads so far, i'm inclined to wait a while longer...wonder if those new-and-improved (toward flat) crt's are just around the corner?
wouldn't that be nice!
