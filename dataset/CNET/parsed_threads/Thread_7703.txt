<s> My daughter's PC failed on bootup and it appears that the HDD is at fault. </s>
<s> It is a Seagate Barracuda Ultra ATA, Model ST313620A, capacity 13,520Mb. </s>
<s> Yep, I know it's 13.5Gb but that's what the label says. </s>
<s> I tried it in my PC as a slave, just in case it was a power issue, as the PSU in her's had been replaced about 1 year previously, but I was not able to boot at all. </s>
<s> (No OS detected on either drive). </s>
<s> I then tried it with a USB IDE adaptor, which has it's own PSU, but no joy. </s>
<s> I removed the back panel to gain access to the motor connections and tested for open or short circuit but they seem okay. </s>
<s> When connected to the PSU, no power is reaching the motor, so it appears that the PCB is shot. </s>
<s> I am hoping to obtain a similar HDD and swap over the PCB to get the drive spinning and hopefully recover the data to another good drive. </s>
<s> Question: Do I need to get an identical drive with the same Firmware and Addressable Sectors? </s>
<s> I've managed to locate one that has the same Seagate Model # but is labelled as 13.6Gb and the Firmware # is 3.11 instead of 3.10. </s>
<s> It also has slightly more Addressable Sectors. </s>
<s> Any advice regarding this would be most welcome as my daughter is keen to recover pictures of her baby. </s>
<s> Thanks, Gourockian </s>
<s> it up. </s>
<s> Even if you do that ...make sure it's set up as a slave ... not a master or bootable drive Might be worth checking with a data recovery PRO like ONTRACK to see what they'd charge if the data is really realy important and user recovery questionable. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks, VAPCMD for replying. </s>
<s> I take it you mean to back up the data if I can recover it to another drive, in the event of a repeat crash in the future. </s>
<s> If I can just manage to do a recovery, this drive will be getting trashed, as I have no wish to go through all this again, and neither does my daughter. </s>
<s> I will certainly be re-emphasizing to her the need to do regular backups from now on. </s>
<s> As to using a data recovery service, it really would be more expensive than we could afford, even though the data is important to her. </s>
<s> Regards, Gourockian </s>
<s> logic board, it's more likely to be a matter of copyng the data to another HDD once it's up and running. </s>
<s> Make sure you connect it so you're not booting from it. </s>
<s> Re backup..I'm a firm firm believer ... </s>
<s> I always have the data and two copies for backup. </s>
<s> Just too time consuming to reinstall everything on a custom PC (vs store bought PC using restore discs). </s>
<s> I image my C: partition, then my D: partition onto a second HDD and then copy the images to an external. </s>
<s> If drive one becomes corrupt and can't be fixed simply...I can reformat C: and restore a clean working images. </s>
<s> If drive 0 dies, I replace the HDD and restore the images from the 2nd HDD. </s>
<s> Beats the heck out of finding discs, product keys, reinstalling evrything, updating everything ... makes me tired just talking about it. </s>
<s> Good Luck and let us know how it works. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS..Try NTBackup....it's part of XP...may help you avoid getting dragged into this next time. </s>
