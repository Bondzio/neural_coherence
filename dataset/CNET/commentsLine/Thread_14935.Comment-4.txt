since it's a dell or such, that os (windows) is likely to be an oem so factor that into your costs in case it doesn't activate on your new motherboard.
the power supply looks good for all but dual video cards, many hard disks, etc so i'd stop there.
as to sata drives, these feel no faster to me than the old drives.
but be sure you are ready with the needed driver diskettes or ask if your new board emulates ide to ease the install of the windows os.
and no.
windows doesn't like such changes so we usually get to start over.
