guys i have the same problem that windows xp doesn't ask for a driver for it, instead it just adds a usb printing service or something strange so stupid i want to see the virtual lpt port which seem to be almost impossible now.
i installed windows 98 back trying to figure where is the problem and windows 98 worked perfectly.
does anybody has a solution please let me know
