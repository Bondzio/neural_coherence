I currently have a dell studio 1537 laptop with 3gb RAM and a intel core 2 duo t5800 processor and was wondering if upgrading to 8 gb ram will make a significant difference in performance. I sometimes get bogged down but im not sure if its from the ram or the processor.

I keep it lean and it would boot up in about 2 - 2-1/2 minutes with the stock 60 Gig 5200 RPM drive. I wanted a larger drive so I bought a 160 Gig 7200 RPM. Boot time was almost cut in half. And performance is much faster.
