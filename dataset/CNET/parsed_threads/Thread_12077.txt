<s> Is there a stable storage software at a good price point that is VMware 5.0 certified and preferably other than MS? </s>
<s> If there is a lesson that has repeated over the years is that storage is not &quot;storage&quot; but a copy. </s>
<s> I can't guess how long you've been at this but when you wrote &quot;stable storage&quot; it makes me think you are just beginning to see the problem. </s>
<s> Keep at it. </s>
<s> Make more copies and your data may be safe. </s>

<s> I was referring to a storage software product that is cost effective, VMware certified, reliable, and preferably runs on Linux because Linux is the most stable OS. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> You may have to be more detailed since Linux has done storage systems for over a decade. </s>
<s> Yes, its been that long. </s>
<s> Any certification is going to be costly and mean nothing to those that lose data. </s>
<s> Why is that an issue here? </s>
