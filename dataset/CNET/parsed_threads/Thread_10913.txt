<s> Hello, I've just bought a new DELL Dimension 8400 with CD-RW and DVD-RW drives. </s>
<s> I'm having a problem with playing back audio on the CD-drive. </s>
<s> Data recording/playback works well on both drives. </s>
<s> Dell Tech support are not much use so I thought I'd seek other opinions. </s>
<s> I'm an PC amateur, but I think my PC is configured with a single IDE cable from the motherboard which goes to the CD (middle connector) and DVD (end connector). </s>
<s> My CD sound is choppy in this configuration. </s>
<s> I tried swapping the cables round and found that the DVD sound was choppy. </s>
<s> So whichever device is connected to the 'middle' cable connector gives poor sound. </s>
<s> It's identified as '2' on the cable. </s>
<s> My simple brain told me that there's probably a problem with the IDE cable - so I ordered a new one from DELL. </s>
<s> However, when I searched the net I found all sorts of confusing stuff about Slaves/Masters/Cable select - so I'm starting to wonder if it is the cable or whether something is set up incorrectly with my system (bear in mind it's less than a month old - and you'd have thought(!) </s>
<s> that DELL would have set it up correctly). </s>
<s> If anyone has any insights into this problem I'd been very grateful - the DELL tech support guys seem little more qualified than me! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Sounds as if you may have sniffed it out. </s>
<s> Try the new cable, then post back the results. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> hi, i hav the same problem as you, i have just bought a new dell computer, and the sound quality on the dvd drive is very poor. </s>

<s> thanks, mike </s>
<s> This is not Dell's repair center. </s>
<s> Do give it to them to fix it. </s>
