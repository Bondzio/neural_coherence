1.1.1	My Mom is a 90 year old artist and writer and needs a new desktop .	St
1.1.2	She has a monitor , scanner , external storage and printer but needs a new desktop that can help her write and publish her poems and her art books .	St
1.1.3	She uses Microsoft WORD , Microsoft Publisher , BlurbSmart , Picasa and , of course , uses a browser for searching and reading the news .	St
1.1.4	What computer and configuration of CPU , RAM graphics card , disk drive do you recommend ?	Ques
1.1.5	She would like to keep the cost down around $ 500 but preferably below that , if she can get one that handles all the above .	St
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	And you can use most if not all of what you have .	St
1.2.2	What was the old desktop ?	Ques

1.3.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktop-computer-buying-guide/	St
1.4.1	She has now a Dell Dimension 4550 Pentium 4 1 GB RAM Maybe 70 GB Hard Drive .	St
1.4.2	No graphics card .	St
1.4.3	Has very little space in her small one room apartment in Assisted Living .	St
1.5.1	If the old PC provided what she needed , then another newer Dell will do .	St
1.5.2	Right now , sales and deals are being offered more so than any other time of the yr. Visit the Dell online website and view what 's avaialble .	St
1.5.3	Even an entry level desktop system is better than the old PC .	St
1.5.4	As for space saving the newer Vestro 's should do OK , IMHO .	St
1.5.5	However , I do suggest you look at the OptiPlex models because these being business models tend to be more robust and *may* offer better support and look into order from the small business side if possible .	St
1.5.6	Of course other OEM vendors like Gateway , HP , etc. , are selling online too , so it would be good to look them over .	St
1.5.7	Whatever you order if from some OEM vendor , get what you need then , as the warranty will cover all .	St
1.5.8	If eyesight asnd tactical feel for older living is needed , maybe that assisted living outfit can offer clues to what works for its residents or similar organizations ( online ) could provide .	St
1.5.9	I take my cue from say , the hearing impaired , what they offer to those in need .	St
1.5.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	All your comments were appreciated .	Polite
1.6.2	Thank you .	St
1.6.3	Will probably go with a Dell 580 with an i3-550 4GB RAM and 750 GB hard drive or a similar Acer with Athlon II x4 640 at Amazon - with 4GB RAM and 1T of hard drive - both under $ 550 .	St
1.7.1	A nod to the i3 model .	St
1.7.2	I have too many machines to compare and Intel is doing fine here .	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	If you keep your eye on the sales and go with a local merchant .	St
1.8.2	You buy the machine ... .if it does not work ... .you bring it back ... .done .	St
1.8.3	You buy the machine ... .mom does not like it ... you bring it back ... .done .	St
1.8.4	If you go mail order and there is a problem it could be a hernia .	St
1.8.5	I would think that just about any 500 buck machine from wally-mart or the like will do what mom needs .	St
1.9.1	Found an HP Pavilion p6620f Desktop Computer With AMD Phenom ?	Ques
1.9.2	II 820 Quad-Core Processor 6 GB RAM and 1 TB hard drive for $ 530 plus tax .	St
1.9.3	Do you think this will do the job ?	Ques
1.10.1	But I still give the nod to the i3 .	St
1.10.2	The unit you noted is one I ca n't give a nod to .	St
1.10.3	It seems overkill .	St
