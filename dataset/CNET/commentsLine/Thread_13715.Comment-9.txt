people assume that troubleshooters know users' network configurations and desktop configurations.
there are multiple ways you can setup a local area network and access the internet.
if you go to a doctor, he is going to ask you all kinds of questions about what ails you.
troubleshooters aren't any different.
we ask many question and the more details you can provide about your network, hardware and software configuration, the better and quicker we can help people.
also as you might have gathered from reading the various posts, no two troubleshooters are going to prescribe the same remedy.
some like to get into the programing side to fix things while others prefer to reinstall the whole shebang to fix it.
i belong in the latter group.
after a diagnose, i've learned to substitute a suspected hardware with one that i know works.
if it's a setup problem, tear it down to its simple components and then work your way up.
so if we're trying to help you and we seem to be asking questions that you think might not be pertinent to your case, i beg you to be patient.
our work is doubly hard because we can't physically see your setup and most of us who work with networks are hands-on kind of people.
anyway, don't give up too easily
