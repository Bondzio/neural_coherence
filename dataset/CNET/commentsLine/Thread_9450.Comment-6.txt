i have just joined cnet trying to get some clarity on similar weird things happening to now 6 computers bought new all set up and two second hand.
my technical understanding is very limited.
i have given up on getting techs help though.
they usually can't understand what is happening with my gear, and my internet connections, and online services.
for example computers often wont start, pressing the button does nothing.
i took one to a tech and he handed it back a few days later said there was nothing wrong with it, started straight away for him.
he checked it thoroughly and could find nothing wrong and it kept starting for me after that, but other things then happened to that one.
three others have done the same not starting thing, two intermittently.
there may be a simple explanation for your problems, but my conclusion with mine is that the computers are being sabotaged remotely.
i could give many more examples and reasons i have come to this conclusion and also the conclusion that some protection against em beams and pulses is required.
i have had similar experiences with tvs and radios.
only one such device has not had weird things happening with it and that is a small sony radio and guess what it was specifically built by a public speaker who had such a protective device put in it as he was having problems of interference with its use providing translations to members of his audience.
