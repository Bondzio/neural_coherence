<s> I have a Creative Zen Vision M. Every time I plug it into a USB port and the Zen is Identified as docked the PC shuts off completely. </s>
<s> Some PC specs are: Asus K8V-MX motherboard, 1GB RAM, AMD Athlon XP 2500 CPU, 80 GB HD. </s>
<s> I've tried using the Zen on a new Notebook I bought and it works fine on it. </s>
<s> Unfortunately all my music files are on my PC. </s>
<s> Any help or suggestions would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If we skip that driver this is something we see happen. </s>
<s> Here's a recent discussion where we take the long road to getting it updated. </s>

<s> motherboard chipset driver version is 4.46. </s>
<s> I guess we can discuss this at length. </s>
<s> What do you need to know to go get the latest drivers? </s>
<s> It's a very common issue which I solve daily by installing such. </s>
<s> I find many want to discuss why this happens. </s>
<s> Sorry, but I'd rather just fix it and move on. </s>
<s> If the latest doesn't fix it then we drill down to less common issues. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>

<s> I downloaded and installed the VIA Hyperion Pro Driver Package Version 5.10A. </s>
<s> Rebooted the PC after installation, plugged in the Creative Zen to the USB and the PC still powers down after docking. </s>
<s> If it powers down, tell me what wattage rating you had in the power supply. </s>
<s> You are not alone if it's just the front ports. </s>
<s> See http://www.pcclub.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=3&threadid=18841 Bob </s>
<s> The power supply is 300 watts. </s>
<s> The case only has rear USB ports. </s>
<s> The USB cable I am using I also use for an MP3 player and digital camera without issues. </s>
<s> While I wouldn't expect an USB device to push it over the edge that's mightly slim. </s>
<s> What happens if you use a powered USB hub? </s>
<s> And I did run into an issue with my PalmOne TX. </s>
<s> It would garble data when I used an extension cable and cause problems. </s>
<s> Connect it directly to the USB port without a cable or only the cable supplied with the player. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I bought a powered USB Hub and it did the trick. </s>
<s> It works great now. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
