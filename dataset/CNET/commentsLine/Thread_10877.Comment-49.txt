upgrading to a ssd will definitely reduce the heat build up when using your 2007 mbp regardless of what you are doing.
however i'm not a video editor so i can't give you much advice regarding the type of video files you are processing and what effect they have on your mbp as different processing programs require the use of varying resources.
i will suggest that you off load your video files to a secondary drive for processing and store only the finished product on the ssd.
remember ssd's aren't the best choice for heavy video editing.
better still...you can purchase a hd enclosure for your wdc drive and plug it into a usb port on your mbp to continue your video processing which would eliminate having to move a bunch of files to a new drive.
also, if you can get your hands on a copy upgrade the os to snow leopard (on the wdc and ssd) which i believe may be as far as you can go with your model.
finally, even though you claim that the pillow you use is not intrusive i still recommend avoiding the use of anything that may have even a remote possibility of interferring with your mbp's airflow.
there are some lap coolers designed for your model that you might consider if you must use your mbp in your lap.
good luck!
together everyone achieves more
