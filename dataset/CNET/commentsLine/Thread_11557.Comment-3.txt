the &quot;optium&quot; usage of any inks is to be within its &quot;use by&quot; period.
while the degrading levels can differ it's just a warning to use by and prolonged usage of such inks can only lead to a final gasp.
however, since using epson or anyone else's ink brand can cause similar results sooner or later as epson prtheads will clog.
the sad fact is, clearing clogged epson prthead isn't as easy or quickly resolved by replacing the prthead by a user, so &quot;cleaing cycles&quot; are the best approach and repeated cleaning is a must.
that uses alot of ink and the expense can be high.
i suggest you find a vendor that sells a &quot;cleaning cartridge&quot; which contains some cleaner or solvents that can handle stubborn clogs as the cheapest solution, otherwise repair is too costly, just replace the printer.
good luck -----willy
