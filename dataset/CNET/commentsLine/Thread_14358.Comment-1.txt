i just put together a pc and the thing will not boot.
i have refered to the asus manual and several pc guides(since yesterday i've been on this) and the connectors and wires are properly placed.
the only wire that is not connected is the 4pin 'speaker' panel connector which i am not seeing; there is no aud, sp, spk, connector in the case.
this doesn't seem to be the problem though.
when i press the i/o: - the psu and/or cpu makes a power on sound - the psu fan does not move, - the power led light is lit, - the cpu fan moves for one second then stops, - there is no sound coming from the harddrive - the monitor is black and no image displays this leads me to believe there is power coming from the psu but there is just something wrong.
i have tried both psus i own (400/500w) and i get the same result.
i had the cpu installed onto the mobo by a technician at the store and i verified it today and it's properly installed.
i really need some help and hope i can save 50$ for installation/inspection fees thanks for any advice and help in advance.
asus a8v mobo, amd 64 3500+ with hsf 3x 512 ddr400 a-top z-alien case(comes with 500w atx 12v psu) psu 400w atx 12v nvidia fx5700 ultra (bios/drivers etc on hdd)
