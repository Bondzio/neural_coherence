SeaTools Desktop's Full Scan revealed a boatload of bad sectors, and the drive ultimately failed the test.
So, it's confirmed that I have a second broken drive on my hands.
The real question for me now is, what should I change in my hardware setup before putting another disk in there?
I have this nagging feeling its the new power supply I just bought.
RAM dosen't seem to be an issue; SeaTool's System Memory Check passed.
(I'm going to run MemTest86+ later tonight, just to make sure).
I'm also going to switch out the new power supply with an older one I know works well once a new drive shows up in the mail.
If that drive gets fried the same way the first two did despite changing the PSU and the memory checks out okay, well, then I know it was a motherboard problem.
Does this make sense, or am I forgetting about some other possible factor?
