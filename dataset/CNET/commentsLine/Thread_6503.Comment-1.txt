hi, when i try to print pictures and sometimes text, i get thick lines appearing vertically through it.
i have tried to re-align the print heads but it doesn't help.
i didn't have any problems until a few weeks ago and i can't seem to get rid of them.
i'm using windows xp.
any help would be great.
thanks ste
