I have two LAN connections from two different service providers, and obviously with different conncetivity settings. The PC is currently having one ethernet connector. How can I configure my PC to run both LANs at the same time but with different settings?

We do have an in-house LAN sort of a thing but recently our boss decided to get another ISP running in case te first one bogs down. I did installed another NIC in addition to the Built-In Ethernet connector. But how will I configure IE6 with two opposite settings?
