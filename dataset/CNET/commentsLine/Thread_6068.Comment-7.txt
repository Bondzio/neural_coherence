wow, everything you all have said has really given me some things to think about.
.
.maybe making it harder to choose.
that being said, if you took away how &quot;pretty&quot; the macs are, dollar for dollar, which one is better and gives you more value for your money?
also, if i did go with a mac, how easy is it to move information and files from a pc to a mac?
for those who asked what games i play: sims2 and soon to play spore.
thanks to all who have answered so far
