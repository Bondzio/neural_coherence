I've given up, and have been looking on newegg.com But the thing is, some of the stuff they talk about is confusing. What's a good deal for the essentials (M.B., Processor, RAM), and where can I find them? I'm happy with 512 MB of RAM, P3-P4 (or AMD equivalent) processor, and at least four PCI slots. Plus, if it's available, an AGP slot. I already have a case, PSU, optical drives, an HDD, and keyboard & mouse. I just need the essentials. Thanks, bye for now.

ASUS motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131512 AMD Sempron processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819104226 Kingston ValueRAM http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820141424 Total, they'd be about $175. I think the performance will be more than enough... do you think these three are worth it?

4830	4	128752	1459233	1454622	martylk2	10/5/05 6:04 PM	1.12853544E12	That's good stuff but, like Ray said, it's dead end...	though you can go up to 2.4 GH with a Athlon 64 3700 a better bet would be an Intel based socket 775 platform. You could start out with a lowly Celeron for cheap and go all the way up through the dual core procs, which include Extreme Edition versions...basically having a 1066 MH frontside bus.

Do you mean that I won't be able to upgrade the processor, RAM, or both later on? I've lived with mediocre computers for quite a while, and though I know this is far from top of the line, I think I could potentially get many years out of this setup... but then again, I don't know. I don't do a whole lot of photo editing, and I don't do any video editing (though that may change later). I do some audio editing, but even on my current system, it's fine, so it'd be even better with what I've shown. Two things I especially like about the board is it has 5 PCI ports, an AGP slot, and 5 audio jacks (which I take to mean it has built-in surround, correct?). In addition, the board is USB 2.0, so I wouldn't need to /just/ use my PCI card... I could use the board, as well. Someone said I need at least 400W for my PSU... is 300 enough? I guess I'll find out, and if not, I'll upgrade later. Also, with the board I've asked about, does it have a way to have frontal USB ports? Okay, thanks for the help, good day. -Christopher

The motherboard should have USB sockets for this purpose. There is always the alternative in buying a USB hub. Just make sure it's a powered USB hub so you don't have to rely on power from a USB port. Those are generally 1.1 ports. These hubs are always on sale with rebates that make them very inexpensive. Either google it or check CNET's &quot;compare prices&quot; for the deals. Dead-end-path means that the capability for expansion/upgradability is being phased-out because of emerging technology. It's true, that socket is being phased out for the faster and more flexible chip format, but it should still last you for a couple of years. Unless, of course, you get the Jeff Gordon bug. Your 300w psu is no longer supplying a full 300w of power to your motherboard. I'd almost guarantee it. Generally, there would be a loss of 10 to 30 percent. Even new generics don't put out advertised wattage at the motherboard. It's up to you. Just remember, if your motherboard doesn't get enough power it'll run hot and could very well lead to a CPU failure. and life goes on... Jack

AMD will not release newer socket 754's. Also ALL socket 939 CPU's support Dual Channel memory and allow non registered memory for the FX models. Dual Channel memory is the only way to provide the maximum memory bandwidth that the CPU can handle.

But you make a good point; it's not worth risking one of the essentials, just to save money on a power supply. But I am wondering if there is a way to test to see if what I have is enough. Like a heat test, or power test or something, to make sure it gets the proper amount of power and doesn't overheat. I'm not going to be using a LOT of stuff in the case (two optical drives, and an HDD is all, probably, plus whatever's connected), so maybe I don't need all the power of 400. Thanks for the help, and any more you can help with.
4830	9	128752	1460424	1460356	Ck87.JF	10/6/05 12:27 PM	1.12860162E12	AMD socket 939	Well, I think I found one... it's a bit higher, but it IS 939, like you suggested. ASUS A8V Socket 939 VIA K8T800 Pro ATX AMD Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131541 Researching the processors, for a 939 processor, the prices are outrageously higher than the 754 that I had listed... $146, versus $63, or something like that. I don't know... thoughts? Again, thanks for all the help. -Chris
4830	10	128752	1460486	1460424	Ray Harinec	10/6/05 12:58 PM	1.12860348E12	And, unfortunately there is	very little downward move in the prices except for the 754, including Dell, and HP etc with systems using the 754. Thus even waiting for a few months might not help. There a re a lot of other advantages to the socket 939 CPU's using the 90 NM cores. The 130 NM [.013 micron] cores power is in the 86 watt range while the 90 NM are in the mid 60's, a boon to easier cooling. Whether any of this is of interest to you has to be traded off against cost for your situation. Don't misunderstand, the AMD 754 CPU's are still rather good.
4830	11	128752	1461079	1460486	Ck87.JF	10/6/05 6:58 PM	1.12862508E12	754	Okay, Im thinking I am going to just wait on socket 939, and go with a 754 for now. I know that I will not be able to upgrade its processor in the future (unless I use a higher-grade processor thats already present later down the road and itll be cheaper then), but if I need a little more speed, Ill always be able to upgrade RAM to maybe a gig or more, but I do not know if I necessarily want to spend all the money on a 939 right now. Later down the road, the 939s will be cheaper, and so by the time I am ready to upgrade, the 939s will be reasonably priced. And honestly, the 754 will be more than enough for me for a while, as I am not that intense of a user. The computer I am typing this on is an OLD mini Gateway, designed for WinME (though I have XP on it), so I imagine when I go to the new computer, it will be a major jump in performance. The processor that I previously linked to seemed to have disappeared from newegg, so I guess I will just have to substitute that with another: AMD Sempron 64 2600+ Palermo 800MHz FSB 128KB L2 Cache http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819104249 I don't know how they differ, but this one will work with the motherboard. Anyway, considering the fact that I don't want to spend a huge amount of money, and the fact that this stuff /is/ pretty current, do you think this is good for me to get for now, and perhaps upgrade in a few years/ Thanks, -Chris
4830	12	128752	1461115	1461079	Ray Harinec	10/6/05 7:29 PM	1.12862694E12	Certainly, howevr by then the	AMD upgrade will be to the socket M [present planned name for mid 2006]. The 754 and 939 are locked into DDR memory because the memory controller hub is physically in the CPU rather than on the mobo's chipset. In order to use DDR 2 they have to redesign the entire CPU. Tentatively planned for mid 2006, but don't bet that they won't beat that date. However even when that comes out you'll still be happy with your 754, so make the move and get rolling. Let us know when its running and how you like. Good luck, and never look back on a decision intelligently made.

If it is an older product, there is a good chance they will not restock. NewEgg.com is my favorite, but if you really want that processor, try to find it on PriceGrabber.com. You might find it for an even better price. Good luck and have fun with the build!

Later down the road, I may go ahead and get a greater-wattage psu, to better facilitate the PC's power needs, but I think for now, the psu can handle it. Now, if only my dad will send the money (he says he's doing that today). Thanks again for all of your help, and I hope you all have a good day. -Christopher

Been using it regularly since 1997. I find it entirely more reliable then ad sponsored sites like My Simon or shopper.net. Good luck, but if you check this site out, don't be surprised if you can find a 939 motherboard for a 754 price.

I took linkit's advice and checked out pricegrabber.com, and found that pricegrabber had a cheaper alternative to newegg for the motherboard (sure, only a $1.50 difference, but still). I like the fact that pricegrabber finds prices from several different sites, and lists them, with the best one marked, &quot;your best buy!&quot; So, the RAM and processor have been bought on newegg, and the motherboard on pricegrabber. When I get the stuff, I'll tell you more.

I spent the day yesterday hooking everything up, and making sure it was all good, and then I powered it up. Right now, I'm enjoying the 5.1 surround sound on the built-in super sound card on the motherboard, watching Lion King (yes, I know... but since I was young, that's always been my favorite). Anyway, I took a glance at my last motherboard, and I noticed that it has some DDR RAM in it. The pink sticker (this was a built computer, so the various parts have pink stickers labeling them) says it's PC266 32x64 256MB DDR RAM. I was wondering... could I possibly use this in conjunction with my PC3200 512MB DDR RAM? I checked out the slot with the 256 stick, and it'd fit in there if I put it in, but I don't know if it's compatible with the motherboard, or maybe with the other RAM. Two other things about the 512 stick - it's Kingston, and it's 184 pin (the 256 probably is, too, because it fits). Anyway, the PC is GREAT so far, and I love it! One other question: what is a good temperature range for a processor? Mine's running around 90-93 degrees fahrenheit. Thank ya much... -Christopher

There are two good sites to go to. CNET is good for reviews but if you want more technical data and also have the information geared more towards the gamer www.tomshardware.com is an excellent site to find out the latest and greatest about the various computer components. The web site has articles on CPU's, graphic cards, etc. I use it when I want a second opinion or if I am not sure which way to go when I upgrade. They have excellent articles on AMD and Intel CPU's. Which CPU has the most bang for the buck. Which chipset is upgradeable which is obsolete or soon to be. They compare the performance of various graphic cards both ATI and NVidia based chip sets. This website though is geared towards the gamer but it does have insightful info on what is best for a basic or complex home/office system too.

I was looking at two Thermaltakes, but I'm not sure the cheaper one is compatible with my motherboard. On one area of the motherboard, it has a twenty pin connector (10x2), and on another area, a four pin connector (2x2). My current power supply (Antec 350W) has this type cf connection, as does the Thermaltake 420W. The Thermaltake 430W, however, has a 24 pin connector, as well as the other four pin connector. Will the 24 pin connector fit my motherboard (and just hang out with the extra), or can I not use it, or is there maybe an adapter?

If your motherboard matches the 430w then get that one although I doubt it will. I always go with the &quot;best&quot; fit and since your mobo doesn't accommodate the extra 4 pins, I would not get the 430w unit. Personally, I'd recommend a 500w unit which would allow for further upgrades in the future. The choice is yours, of course. and life goes on... Jack
