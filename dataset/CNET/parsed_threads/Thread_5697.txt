<s> Hi, My computer has been infected with a virus for awhile now and it's affecting overall performance. </s>
<s> I'm throwing to much money into anti virus programs that aren't doing the job. </s>
<s> I need to to scrub the hard drive and start over fresh. </s>
<s> Can you recommend a product that can be effective and information on operating system installation? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Most computers either come with a set of disks to recover your computer to out of box condition or has a feature to make a set of recovery disks to correct problems just like yours. </s>
<s> They also have a D partition on the hard drive that has a recovery program. </s>
<s> There are several free programs such as Rkill, Malwarebytes, Superantivirus and others that don't cost anything except the price of a blank CD and the time to run them. </s>
<s> There are free antivirus programs you can download and run, just Google &quot;Free Antivirus programs&quot; and choose one. </s>
<s> Some ISPs will give you free antivirus programs just for subscribing to their service. </s>
<s> In my case I am with Comcast and they supply Norton 360v5 at no charge. </s>
<s> Did you create or order the restore media FIRST!! </s>
<s> And there is no need to toss money at this. </s>
<s> Consider what Grif writes at link -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/7726-6132_102-5098912.html?tag=posts;msg5099421 Bob </s>
<s> No matter what recovery operation that is used won't effect the data that's stored on your saved media *IF* they contain the virus and you return the virus again back to a just recovered PC. </s>
<s> In other words, once you're certain the PC is clean, then run the AV pgm. </s>
<s> against any offloaded stored media to scan and cleanse them as well. </s>
<s> Here's what I do when all else fails and get the go ahead to do a total wipe out or cleaning. </s>
<s> Using DBAN or KILLDISK, totally wipe clean the HD. </s>
<s> Once done, using the recovery discs to return the PC back to day 1 -OR- the day those back-ups were created. </s>
<s> Do a full OS reload, any drivers and then OS updates from service. </s>
<s> Install or run the AV pgm. </s>
<s> after its own update to check and verify the PC. </s>
<s> Finish the PC recovery by installing at that time any pgms. </s>
<s> not reloaded or user supplied. </s>
<s> if you have data, return it to its proper directories. </s>
<s> If all this is from ext. </s>
<s> HD or flash drives these have already been AV scanned, otherwise you may introduce the virus back again. </s>
<s> Don't take anything for granted, scan to check. </s>
<s> Lesser infections may not need a total rebuild as it were but the &quot;time and effort&quot; usually become just as long or intensive. </s>
<s> Sometimes, you're reward for shortcuts is finding out you really didn't remove the virus. </s>
<s> However, if the infection is known and following any online posted help many times allows an user to continue in good health. </s>
<s> Afterwards, be careful of how you possibility got infected in the 1st place, maybe some email, loaned disc, borrowed ext. </s>
<s> media or P2P access like Torrent, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
