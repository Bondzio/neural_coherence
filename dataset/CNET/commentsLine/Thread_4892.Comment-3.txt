thanks very much bob, i'll get in touch with my mate who fitted the board for me.
he should be able to find where in the bios to turn off that power thing.
just noticed that the keyboard lights stay on too - i'll be turning the power off by the wall socket as well tonight, just as a precaution take care, and thanks again!
