...i did not understand what all those abbreviations mean...(i guess you can say i am a 'rookie'.)
what is the cmos?
nvram?
hdd's?
and i didn't understand this entire statement: &quot;when you see the bios or pheonix screen, (usually after the computer finishes its post), try hitting on those keys and before you reset the bios, make sure that the drive configuration for the hdd's are properly selected.&quot; if someone could elaborate, i would appreciate it greatly.
