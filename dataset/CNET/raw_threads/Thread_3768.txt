Emachines and Gateway strongly recommend using an ATI based graphics card stated in their documentation and include a $20 rebate for the ATI Radeon X700 Pro. Do you think putting in a 6600gt board would create a conflict? Thanks......................... Tom

Can you provide? Thanks,

85	5	102764	1179435	1179351	SeaninWa	5/9/05 7:35 PM	1.1156673E12	Hey	Hey, Well I think when he used that word 'conflict' it was not a good representation. I could be wrong though. As they, Nvidia and ATI, are both supported by the PCI-Express slot on both machines. To the best of my knowledge. What I would like to know and I think he would too is would it just be better then to use a ATI card x600,x700,x800,x850 etc than to use Nvidia card. Since the documentation, from what I understand here, supports both but recommends ATI cards. I have read here also though to get the 6600gt over say the x700pro, since it performs better, evidently regardless of the ATI card recommendation in the documentation. Is that a fair statement? I will next week be purchasing one of the two and I am still not sure which. I am leaning toward the 6600gt now after reading some on it. But I don't know if any retailer (only 3 I canthink of are Best Buy, Circuit City and CompUSA) in my area carries a 6600gt PCI-E card and I DON'T want to wait I want it all the same day lol. I have checked online and none of them have them it seems, or are out of stock heh. Plenty of x700pro's though. Can't find x700xt's in retail stores though . Good Luck to us both btw!

It is always recommended even if you don't have a motherboard based on ati graphics to stick with ati if you have it already on your computer and nvidia if you have that. Mostly, ATIs are stuck to intel and Nvidia to AMD, the 2 makers have equal shares in apple. Roger
