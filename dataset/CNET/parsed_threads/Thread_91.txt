<s> I have read here that putting a non-working hard drive in a freezer will make it work again. </s>
<s> I am asking for the specifics on the max temperature the hard drive can sustain in a freezer and how to bag it properly. </s>
<s> I have 2 failed hard drives, a 250GB and a 10 GB, so, i am desperate to try a way to start these drives since a professinal data recovery and a new computer is out of the question due to the prices. </s>

<s> in something absorbent first, then put it in a freezer bag and place in the freezer for 12 hours. </s>
<s> If it spins-up, copy the files quickly before it fails. </s>
<s> This doesn't make it work again. </s>
<s> Just might get it going long enough to copy the files out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The &quot;freezer cure&quot; is a carryover when HDs were in the Mb range. </s>
<s> Plus, it *may* allow the electronics &quot;contract&quot; if an open or burnt component, BUT this is only a temporary fix, not a real fix. </s>
<s> Thus, you need to get any data if that's the sole purpose and do it quickly. </s>
<s> Understand, if it fails further, it maybe corrupt the data even more, so beware. </s>
<s> Even then it may not work at all, just be sure to double wrap the HD in plastic and allow at least a few minutes before use to climatize and then power-UP. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> will the drive spin up and the read/write heads track. </s>
<s> As, if I remember correctly, the freezer trick was for bad sectors. </s>
<s> On drives that do not spin up I use an external enclosure. </s>
<s> This allows me hold the HDD in various position, shocking the drive with the power switch. </s>
<s> When and if the drive spins up I hold that position, cross my fingers and start copying files. </s>
<s> Luck Bill </s>
<s> I tried the freezer trick, doesn't work, i have tried it over and over again, and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> i got a 10Gb hard drive from ebay and it worked for a few minutes before it started clicking and it failed. </s>
<s> i am mad that ebay would allow such people to rip you off of 10 dollars. </s>
<s> hmph, and i am buying yet another hard drive from ebay, this time a 500Gb for 11 dollars. </s>
<s> i hope this drive is not a waste of money.anyway, what shall i do to get my moneys worth out of that 10Gb hard drive? </s>
<s> i would hate to see my money going to some one who rips people off regularlly of their hard earned cash. </s>
<s> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. </s>
<s> Come on, a 500gb HD for $10. </s>
<s> It reeks of a possible failure if only worth is $10 for parts. </s>
<s> To believe it'll work for any length of time is less likely on its own. </s>
<s> Remember, if it sounds to good to be true, then its not. </s>
<s> However, you an play with parts all you want as you can be capable of some repairs, provide you treat this as a learning experience. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Ive heard it all now, freeze your hard drive to make it work. </s>
<s> any proof this works or is this just more fairytales from the noob section. </s>
<s> well after doing some research on the topic, I did find out that it can work for short periods of time. </s>
<s> as in a few min or an hour ect. </s>
<s> wich can be long enough to get the files you need off the hard drive. </s>
<s> but also begs the question, why ask that question here??. </s>
<s> for me to find the info took all of 30seconds. </s>
<s> click on new tab - google - type in -- freezing your hard drive And wala I found a million sites that have tons of info about that topic. </s>
<s> A failing laptop drive. </s>
<s> They thought that spinrite could bring it back but the drive wouldn't stay good long enough to try it. </s>
<s> So the put the entire laptop in the garage that was just above freezing (40F or so). </s>
<s> That did the trick. </s>
<s> Remember we are dealing with abnormal hardware with issues. </s>
<s> All bets are off. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its not a permenant fix. </s>
<s> The files were saved and we got them onto a new hard disk. </s>
<s> Well unless you count that the new hard disk will fail in a few years? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Not sure why, but occasionally it works. </s>
<s> Another trick that sometimes works for drives that don't &quot;spin up&quot; is the &quot;snap spin&quot; trick to start the platters turning. </s>
<s> Understand, these are last resorts that usually don't work, and that may damage the drive, but which are being used in situations in which you are ready to trash the drive anyway. </s>
<s> I wouldn't worry too much about wrapping the drive, you are only going to put it into the freezer for 1-2 hours. </s>
<s> Good luck, it sometimes does work, but don't be surprised if it doesn't. </s>
<s> If your hard drive has a physical error (bearing that's bad, rubber seal that's preventing it from spinning up, etc), it might work. </s>
<s> In any case it won't hurt it as long as you make sure you do not get excessive condensation on the unit. </s>
<s> In my case, IBM Travelstar 18 GB that failed a few years ago, it did not work. </s>
<s> But it did allow the drive to spin up - which it did not do before freezing it. </s>
<s> Hard drive recovery is still pricey, and any &quot;no-destructive&quot; method that you can try at home really does not do any damage. </s>
<s> It might start up the drive, and as other already have posted, be ready to copy the files. </s>
<s> This is an article I have ad for a while on the subject: 200 ways to revive a hard drive We based one of our most popular pop quiz challenges on a situation every tech support person has faced or will face at least once: a failed hard drive. </s>
<s> In that particular case, a Compaq Prolinea 4/66 user was getting errors like &quot;disk 0 error&quot; and &quot;invalid drive specification.&quot; Here were the other facts in the case: </s>
<s> I have successfully revived 5 hard drives using the following technique. </s>
<s> I found that the problem was not the drive assembly but the controller board attached on the drive. </s>
<s> My Process: 1. </s>
<s> Buy an identical hard drive. </s>
<s> My experience tells me it must be exactly the same, right down to the manufacturer, part number, size, speed, etc. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Remove the controller board from the good drive and swap with the controller from the bad drive. </s>
<s> The screw head type varies - Torx, Allen, Phillips, etc. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Install and boot or read from the old hard drive with the new controller on the drive installed. </s>
<s> Transfer the data to a known good drive. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> You can continue to use the old drive with the new board, or swap back and use the new drive with the new board. </s>
<s> This beats the many dollars data recovery companies charge to recover data for the price of a new drive. </s>
<s> Hey, if it doesn't work, at least you have a new hard drive you can use. </s>
<s> Wrap well, let it come up to temp and I still think your chances are about 10%. </s>
<s> Condensation will usually kill it and if you warm it up slowly itwill lock again but hey, if you can't afford restoration, you have nothing to lose. </s>
<s> Let us know what happened. </s>
<s> Place the failed Drive in an USB External Enclosure, wrapped tightly in a Ziploc Bag or plastic wrap. </s>
<s> Then KEEP it in the Freezer, with the USB Cable trailing out to the Computer. </s>
<s> Computer too far away ? </s>
<s> Place the frozen Drive in a Cooler with Sealed Gel Ice Packs. </s>
<s> I have not tried this, but it would keep the Drive cold far longer, and would minimize condensation issues. </s>
<s> This is a last ditch effort to try to get the drive spinning to copy the data. </s>
<s> The reason behind this is the principle of heat contracts and cold expands. </s>
<s> If the mechanism inside the dirve is jammed this could unjam it. </s>
<s> It won't work if you have a fry circuit or crash heads on the platter or the mechanism is to far gone for this to work. </s>
<s> I read all the stuff before it and couldn't figure out how a hard drive can be kept cold enough during reinstallation to be worth the time in the freezer! </s>
<s> I can just imagine some poor sod freezing it, rushing to install it, try it but it's warm and fails, remove it, freeze it... </s>
<s> FOREVER! </s>
<s> But somehow, putting a drive anywhere moisture is bound to be while keeping it attached to an electrical source is bound to make you very, very unhappy sooner or later. </s>
<s> I had a Gateway drive that was bad and failed in 2 months. </s>
<s> It also made The Click Of Death before it was removed. </s>
<s> I would have tried the freezer trick with that 16 MB beauty but Gateway replaced it with an upgrade - a whopping 21MB!!!! </s>
<s> - and would have voided that replacement if I'd removed the drive myself. </s>
<s> (By the way, that &quot;garbage&quot; Gateway lasted 3 years after that and then only the sound card failed. </s>
<s> Go figure.) </s>
<s> Regarding an eBay hard drive AT ANY PRICE tho, remember that a hard drive is delicate and may have been working before the shipper dropped it, post office punted it onto a convayer belt that dropped it, and the mail carrier dropped it trying to put it in your mailbox before handing it to a neighbour (who shook it out of curiousity) to give you. </s>
<s> But you're annoyed that you spend (GASP!) </s>
<s> $10??? </s>
<s> I suggest you skip the mail order altogether and go to a used computer parts store, test the drive there, and bring it home yourself. </s>
<s> No space in the freezer needed... :-D </s>
<s> I have tried this several times as a last resort. </s>
<s> Once it allowed me to read the drive long enough to retrieve data. </s>
<s> Another time the drive actually kept working reliably after the freezer treatment (I have no idea why). </s>
<s> Most times it doesn't work at all. </s>
<s> But if the next step is to toss the drive, why not try it. </s>
<s> Take a look at this webpage. </s>
<s> Very interesting. </s>
<s> http://geeksaresexy.blogspot.com/2006/01/freeze-your-hard-drive-to-recover-data.html </s>
<s> ereal2000 I think you got it a bit backwards - heat expands and cold contracts - but you were on the right track. </s>
<s> This idea sounds bizarre, but desperate times call for desperate measures. </s>
<s> Next time I think we'll find a way to double maybe even triple ghost the files to keep a crisis from happening again. </s>
