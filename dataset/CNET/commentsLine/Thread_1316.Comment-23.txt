currently, no.
back in the old days, in this case 1997, yes.
when wireless networks needed to be manually configured and most people didn't have them.
big tall tower, room for 4 harddrives, cd player, dvd players for pc's were just becoming available so were expensive.
the cabling from some of the entertainment system components had to go directly to the sound card or video card.
upgraded it a couple of times, cd-rw, dvd player, larger drives.
but it very awesome to be sitting in front of a 37&quot; sony tv switching between the internet, the cd player, and a movie or tv.
highly recommend hooking the pc, internet access, and entertainment center together.
