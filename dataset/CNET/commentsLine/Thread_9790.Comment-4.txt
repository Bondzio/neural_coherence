thanks everyone for help, it looks like edo memory.
i found the datasheet on the chip used (424400) and tracked the pinout with a tester.
each of the modules seem to have 32-bit wide data bus, 4 cas signals to strobe the column address for each individual byte, and 1 ras.
so it is pretty much like 72pin simm, though with only one ras signal.
by the way i checked through jedec jesd-21c standard.
it lists a lot of wierd memory configs but none with 60 pins on it.
so the memory does not conform to jedec.
on both memory slots cas signals different, as well as rases.
all other signals are common to both slots.
i just wonder if a bit of soldering will enable me to use a regular 72 pin simm in here.
am i understanding correctly, that wiring just one ras signal to the simm will simply allow me to use just half of memory?
