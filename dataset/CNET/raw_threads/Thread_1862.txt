Linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base ID 358. I am using the same system with no problems...essentially you &quot;cascade&quot; the routers...change the router IP to 192.168.15.2...disable DHCP...from your modem you connect to Internet port of the RT31P2...connect &quot;ethernet (1) on the RT31P2 to your router (I connected to &quot;4&quot;) All this may sound confusing, at least it does to me, so your best bet is to check out the Linksys Knowledge base...even ask their tech help via e-mail...that's what I did and they were most helpful. This system works great with no problems - good luck

I don't think anything would be THAT much different...you still &quot;cascade&quot; as I describe...I would contact Netgear and get their input. Incidently, my RT31P2 Vonage router is the &quot;first&quot; one in line from the modem. sorry if I confused you with the Linksys info
