1.1.4	i am a die hard AMD fan but hey... i gotta go with what performs.	St
1.1.5	so what do yall think?	St
1.1.6	i dont game alot but i do occasionally play flight simulator x and a few others.	St
1.1.7	i mainly encode and edit pics, vids, music.	St
1.1.8	i want something that has the power when i need it.	St

1.1.10	im just looking for suggestions.	St
1.1.11	any help appreciated.	St
1.1.12	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	which was a good processor.	St
1.2.2	I also have the ASUS A8N-Sli.	St
1.2.3	But when I upgraded about 6 months ago, AMD was clearly not the processor to buy.	St
1.2.4	Based on what I've read recently about Phenom, believe it's same today.	St
1.2.5	My advice, try the link below and go from there.	Sug
1.2.6	Armed with the CPU names, you should be able to find other reviews and articles that should be hitting the stores soon.	St
1.2.7	http://www.anandtech.com/GalleryImage.aspx?id=19 Regards, VAPCMD PS...What kind of problems are you having with the current rig ?	Ques
1.3.1	thanks for the reply and the link.	Polite
1.3.2	not sure exactly whats wrong.	Res
1.3.3	i had 3 hard drives go out in a months time.	St
1.3.4	a 2 and a half year old sata Maxtor 300gb was first to go.	St
1.3.5	then a 100gb Seagate ide hard drive, then my 500gb Seagate ide hard drive.	St
1.3.6	the 500gb was just a few months old.	St
1.3.7	thats all in a little under a month.	St
1.3.8	that cant be a coincidence.	St
1.3.9	my guess is somethings up with the mobo but i dont know what would cause that.	St
1.3.10	any idea?	St
1.3.11	thanks, John	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	its the one that came in the case i got so its probably not a very good one.	St

1.5.3	i was planning on changing it when i built it but i never got around to it.	St
1.5.4	it seemed to be working fine.	St
