1.1.2	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; Do these replacement antennas ( D-link ) that extend the height of the existing antennas , do they just increase range or will they also boost the signal or improve the signal ? & quot ; 1 .	St
1.2.2	Increase range .	St
1.2.3	Yes .	St
1.2.4	But not as far as people may want .	St
1.2.5	Certainly not 2X ... 2 .	St
1.2.6	Boost the signal .	St
1.2.7	No .	St
1.2.8	It 's an antenna .	St
1.2.9	The amount of energy is the same in the amplifier so that 's not it .	St
1.2.10	The antenna has less loss so that will give it more efficient output .	St
1.2.11	But the reception is better , so that helps on the recieve side .	St
1.2.12	3. improve the signal ?	Ques
1.2.13	Doubtful .	St
1.2.14	For transmission , the signal & quot ; quality & quot ; is more about the good design of the transmitter and how well the antenna and complete system is matched .	St
1.2.15	So my answer is no .	St
1.2.16	For reception , a real problem of a more sensitive antenna is you also amplify any other signals in the area .	St
1.2.17	If you have interfering signals , then a better move is to change the RF channels and try again .	St
1.2.18	For reception , my answer is & quot ; doubtful & quot ; to this factor .	St
1.2.19	Bottom line ?	Ques
1.2.20	Try it .	St
1.2.21	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'm going to have to disagree with the other response here on several points .	St
1.3.2	Yes , dependent on the type of antenna you use , an antenna can boost the signal ( by giving it gain ) as well as increase the range .	St
1.3.3	There are several points to consider here .	St
1.3.4	You 're not going to increase the actual number of watts of power coming out of your wireless card , but by choosing the antenna to suit your purpose , you can increase your effective radiating power depending on the antenna you use .	St
1.3.5	If you 're only looking to boost the range within say an office or your home , then a small & quot ; stubby & quot ; omnidirectional antenna will do the trick just fine .	St
1.3.6	If you have something more elaborate in mind , say sharing your wireless connection with a neighbor or over longer distances , you 're going to need a more directional antenna that you will essentially point at the location you 're trying to hit .	St
1.3.7	This type of antenna can take on several forms either as a & quot ; waveguide & quot ; or & quot ; yagi & quot ; ... ..you can build one very inexpensively .	St
1.3.8	Check out the following article for a simple tincan waveguide antenna : http : //www.turnpoint.net/wireless/has.html Also , check out Hyperlink Technologies .	St
1.3.9	They offer a number of inexpensive solutions and also sell the pigtail wire you will need to connect your wireless card to whatever antenna you end up using .	St
1.3.10	Good Luck	St
1.4.1	How can your antenna boost the signal ?	Ques
1.4.2	I did indeed note that antenna would have less loss , but since it 's a passive device , where did the gain of energy come from ?	Ques
1.4.3	Bob ( being picky about this or that . )	St
1.5.1	Any transmitting antenna can provide gain on a transmitted signal over a standard groundplane antenna .	St
1.5.2	Gain antennas such as a Yagi Beam most certainly will offer the advantage of increasing the strength of a transmission .	St
1.5.3	This is the reason why TV and Radio stations use a variety of antennas to increase the effective radiaion power of their stations .	St
1.5.4	It 's not a thermodynamic principle it 's a basic principle of radio transmissions .	St
1.5.5	If you study radio theory , I think you 'll find that what I 'm saying is true .	St
1.5.6	RadioActive1	St
1.6.1	There are principles in RF transmission that most people are n't aware of , or taught .	St
1.6.2	I will try and put it in simpler terms .	St
1.6.3	When people or companies talk about higher gain antennas , you have to realize antenna 's do NOT generate GAIN at all .	St
1.6.4	You have different types of antennas - omni-directional , and directional ( Yagi 's , inverted vees , dishes ) antennas .	St
1.6.5	When you have someone say their antenna has more gain , it is because it 's a directional antenna .	St
1.6.6	They compare it to a standard omni-directional that radiates RF energy in a 360 degree pattern .	St
1.6.7	So if you have a directional antenna that concentrates received/transmitted RF from/to an area within a 30-45 degree span , it will show a stronger signal strength ( therefore a higher gain ) .	St
1.6.8	Just because an antenna is bigger , that does n't mean it 's better .	St
1.6.9	All antennas are built to a 1/4 wavelength of the frequencies it uses .	St
1.6.10	So the antennas are built where they can be used in the VHF , UHF frequencies ( sort of broadbanded ) VHF and UHF are line-of-sight frequencies , so the less obstructions the better .	St
1.6.11	I hope this explained things a little better .	St
1.7.1	To get a gain , one must introduce energy .	St
1.7.2	Where does this energy come from ?	Ques
1.7.3	If you just write it 's less loss , then we are done .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	I think , radioactive1 is right .	St
1.8.2	Every antenna , whatever shape and design , has a gain coefficeient that characterzes it .	St
1.8.3	The energy that all antennae use is picked/catched from the surrounding environment .	St
1.8.4	There are antennas that pick the signal from air , from water ( incl .	St
1.8.5	see water ) and the ground as well .	St
1.8.6	The application of antennae signal input/output could be used in common radiotransmmition and communication ( all means ) as we perceive it in a plain understanding and/or for a large variety of professional/technical applications such as medicine , geology/geophysics , cosmonautics and so on ... The signal could be of a natural field or a provoked ( articially induced ) field .	St
1.8.7	Whatever the environment there is a signal ( say in the air ) radiated ( an artificially induced case ) by a transmmiter ( in mV/m ) .	St
1.8.8	An antenna catches it and focuses and/or concentrates it , so that on antenna output the signal is more powerful then corresponding its input .	St
1.8.9	The 10 fold log .	St
1.8.10	ratio of output over input of a signal ( in principal , whatever the nature of the signal ) is called & quot ; Antenna 's Gain & quot ; and is measured in dB ( deciBells ) .	St
1.8.11	Again all that an antenna does is that it concentrates the energy in a specific direction and consequently there is a signal gain that it introduces to next stage/link of an equipment .	St
1.9.1	I think , radioactive1 is right .	St
1.9.2	Every antenna , whatever shape and design , has a gain coefficeient that characterze it .	St
1.9.3	The energy that all antennae use is picked/catched from the surrounding environment .	St
1.9.4	There are antennas that pick the signal from air , from water ( incl .	St
1.9.5	see water ) and the ground as well .	St
1.9.6	The application of antennae signal input/output could be used in common radiotransmmition and communication ( all means ) as we perceive it in a plain understanding and/or for a large variety of professional/technical application such as medicine , geology/geophysics , cosmonautics and so on ... The signal could be of a natural field or a provoced ( articially induced ) field .	St
1.9.7	Whatever the environment there is a signal there ( say in the air ) radiated ( by a artificial/induced ) by a transmmiter ( in mV/m ) .	St
1.9.8	An antenna catches it and focuses and/or concentrates it , so that in antenna output the signal is more powerful then corresponding its input .	St
1.9.9	The 10 fold log .	St
1.9.10	ratio of output over input of a signal ( in principal , whatever nature of the signal ) is called Antenna 's Gain and is measured in dB ( deciBells ) .	St
1.10.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7589-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=93399 & messageID=1055590 As you can see in the nice pictures , the gain is directional and you lose field strength in the other directory .	St
1.10.2	Total Watts remain the same .	St
1.10.3	Bob	St
1.11.1	Again , it 's not about thermodynamics .	St
1.11.2	It 's about making the most effective use of the energy you have .	St
1.11.3	An omnidirectional antenna radiates energy equally in all directions , or as some would say & quot ; radiates equally poorly in all directions & quot ; .	St
1.11.4	This is true of groundplane antennas in particular , but also of simple dipoles which radiate energy to the sides with the primary radiation lobes being perpendicular to the orientation of the antenna ( i.e .	St
1.11.5	if your dipole is oriented North/South , then you 're best trasmit/receive pattern will be East/West ) .	St
1.11.6	A dipole antenna is the type of antenna that comes packaged with most stereos/receivers and looks like a flat piece of wire in the shape of a & quot ; T & quot ; .	St
1.11.7	A Yagi antenna is basically a dipole with a reflector ( being slightly longer than the element that the coax or antenna wire is connected to ) and one or more directors .	St
1.11.8	In this way the reflector and director elements focus the energy in one direction .	St
1.11.9	When you see a T.V .	St
1.11.10	antenna , this is in effect a type of Yagi or & quot ; beam & quot ; antenna .	St
1.11.11	This is why when you install a T.V .	St
1.11.12	antenna you have to point it in the same general direction as the television stations you are trying to receive .	St
1.11.13	The type of antenna used in your car is a basic omnidirectional groundplane with the groundplane that the antenna works off of being the car body itself .	St
1.11.14	So , bottom line - it 's not about generating more energy , but about making the most effective use of the energy you have .	St
1.11.15	It 's also true that & quot ; size matters & quot ; to a degree , i.e .	St
1.11.16	- a 1/4 wave ( an antenna that is 1/4 of a wavelength of the design frequency ) will be less effective for transmission and receive than a full wave antenna .	St
1.11.17	All of this is just basic antenna theory , nothing more .	St
1.11.18	For more information on antennas , designing antennas ( which is very easy to do in many cases ) , try the ARRL web site : http : //www.arrl.org/tis/info/antheory.html Hope this helps .	St
1.11.19	Radioactive1	St
1.12.1	You 're right , regardless of the antenna type , additional energy ( i.e .	St
1.12.2	more than is generated from the transmitter ) is not generated .	St
1.12.3	However , the person that started this conversation aske if wireless antennas were worth it .	St
1.12.4	You replied that while they increase range , they do n't provide as much as most people want .	St
1.12.5	Not sure what you mean by that , but it has been proven that with the right type of antenna that a WIFI signal can be effectively transmitted for a number of miles - yes , you read that right , miles .	St
1.12.6	You also said that an antenna does not boost a signal .	St
1.12.7	This is simply not true .	Res
1.12.8	While the total power out does not change based on an antenna , ERP or Effective Radiated Power is impacted by the antenna .	St
1.12.9	This is why antennas are rated in terms of gain ( in decibels ) that they provide .	St
1.12.10	If antennas do n't improve signal than why do television and radio stations spend millions putting very elaborate antennas - it 's all in an effort to radiate a signal ( given the power that the FCC limits them to ) as far as possible .	St
1.12.11	To the gentleman that asked the question - If your objective is to radiate your WIFI signal equally in all directions , than try any number of simple groundplane antennas on the market - several of which provide 5db or better & quot ; gain & quot ; ( the unit of measure used to designate the effective signal boost the antenna provides ) .	St
1.12.12	If you are trying to direct your signal in a specific direction , try the Cantenna ( actually a type of waveguide vs. a true antenna ) .	St
1.12.13	Do a google search on WIFI antennas or Cantenna ( an antenna which is very easy to build yourself ) .	St
1.12.14	Hope this helps .	St
1.12.15	RadioActive1	St
1.13.1	You are correct on many of your points here , however , I wanted to comment on a couple of things you said .	St
1.13.2	True antennas do not & quot ; generate & quot ; anything .	St
1.13.3	They are passive devices from a power-generating perspective , but they do provide gain based on how effectively they radiate the power of the transmitting devices .	St
1.13.4	All antennas are ( or can be ) rated in terms of Gain , measured in Decibels ( or db ) .	St
1.13.5	To say that only directional antennas have gain is not true .	St
1.13.6	And to say that all antennas are 1/4 wave is also not true .	St
1.13.7	I have a full-wave HF antenna strung around my backyard .	St
1.13.8	Compared to a simple 1/2 wave dipole it provides somewhere on the order of 3-5db gain over the dipole .	St
1.13.9	Vertical antennas can be 1/4 , 3/8 wave or even full wave ( although for some frequencies this would most certainly be impractical ) .	St
1.13.10	The reason a full-wave antenna has more gain than say a 1/4 antenna is simple - more energy is effectively being radiated off the end of the antenna .	St
1.13.11	Good information presented here - just a few minor & quot ; tweaks & quot ; .	St
1.13.12	RadioActive1	St
1.14.1	radioactive1 is right .	Res
1.14.2	antennas dont generate power but they certainly transfert power .	St
1.14.3	one antenna could be so weak and lot of loss in the signal power , whereas one antenna so be so high quality and good to transfer most of the power with minimal loss .	St
1.14.4	that is why antennas are measured in gain ... remember cheap small antennas only peak a few beams therefore low signal and low gain , bigger antennas would pick up lots os signal so it would have the best coverage and best performance and receive signal with higher gain ... put it this way , put your pc in a corner with desk and lots of things around it , wires , cables etc etc ... maybe a blanket ... .if you notice your reception is so poor and your internet is a bit slower ... because you blocking the signals and very less and minimus signal is received by the antenna ... . more signal the antenna receives , more gain and more performance , quicker internet connection or shall I say wifi connection ...
