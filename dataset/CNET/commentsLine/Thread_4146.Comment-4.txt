frank, fyi, i have a perly's road map cd which normally requires the cd to be in the cd-rom drive when searching for the road maps.
i didn't have to create another partition to do what you did.
i simply copy the contents to the perly's folder on the c drive and there after it works without the need for the cd.
cheers.
