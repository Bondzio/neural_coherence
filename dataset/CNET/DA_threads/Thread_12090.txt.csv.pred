1.1.1	Hey guys, I need help deciding on a new video card for my computer.	St
1.1.2	I have a P4 2.8 gh, 1 gb RAM, and a FX 5700 LE 128MB video card.	St
1.1.3	I might need to upgrade my power supply to accomidate the new card.	St
1.1.4	I do not know the wattage rating of it.	St
1.1.5	I have a AGP slot.	St
1.1.6	My current choices are: A Diablotek GeForce 6600 LE/256MB DDR for $95 from Tiger Direct, a Diamond Radeon X1300 / 512MB DDR2 for $130 also from Tiger Direct, and these Newegg cards: An Apollo 6800 Geforce 6800 128MB 256-bit DDR for $130, an ASUS 512MB Geforce 6800 128-bit GDDR2 for $180, A BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $200, A DIAMOND Radeon X1300 512MB 128-bit GDDR2 for $114, A eVGA Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $100, eVGA Geforce 7800GS CO 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $270, and a PNY Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $112.	St
1.1.7	I would prefer to stay below $200, around $150ish.	St
1.1.8	I want to be able to play Oblivion at decent settings on a 17&quot; moniter, and some other games like it.	St
1.1.9	Any other video cards that I have not listed here that you recomend would be fine as well.	St
1.1.10	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	If I had the funds to upgrade my (motherboard, CPU, Memory, Vidoe card PCI Xpress) I would have but I plan to do that the end off the year.	St
1.2.2	I got the BFG 256 6800 GT AGP in January, which replaced the XFX 256 5700 LE.	St
1.2.3	A week or two latter the 7800 AGP cards came out.	St
1.2.4	I am not planning to upgrade the video card any more.	St
1.2.5	as far as my mobo is concerned it is maxed with the bigest Socket A CPU AMD XP 3200 you can put in it & 2 gigs of PC3200 memory duel channel.	St
1.2.6	Power Supply Thermaltake 680.	St
1.2.7	Get a bigger power supply.	St
1.2.8	I would say get one of the 7800 AGP cards.	St
1.2.9	the specs on them are realy nice.	St
1.2.10	(That is just my opion) Good Luck: Wendell H	St
1.3.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131010 7800GS is a ripoff because AGP is dead.	St
1.4.1	I do not know much about ATI, so can you clear something up?	St
1.4.2	What is the difference between the ATI cards: the X 800, the X 1300, and the X 1600?	St
1.4.3	Hope you can help me with this.	St
1.4.4	Thanks!	St
1.5.1	watch out for tigerdirect.com rebates.	St
1.5.2	you will NOT get you money.	St
1.6.1	I know that most people with newer computers have the ability to use the PCI-e cards, but for those of us with older, can't afford either new computer or new mobo/chip and have the AGP slot, there is still a market.	St
1.6.2	It may be smaller, but it exists.	St
1.6.3	My older Althon XP 1800+ uses AGP.	St
1.6.4	Do I want to upgrade my mobo, etc.?	St
1.6.5	You bet.	St
1.6.6	Can I afford to upgrade?	St
1.6.7	No way, not this year at least.	St
1.6.8	I recently bought from newegg an eVGA FX5500 256mb 128-bit AGP card for under $50.	St
1.6.9	Notwithstanding that I am having weird problems with errors and freezes (could be the driver?	St
1.6.10	), I'm getting a beautiful clear screen for general use.	St
1.7.1	I have the same FX5500 video card, and I like it.	St
1.7.2	(I'm not a gamer.)	St
1.7.3	In general, it's not that one shouln't get an AGP card for an older system.	St
1.7.4	It's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800GS) on an AGP video card is not advisable.	St
1.7.5	If you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's PCI-Express X16 slot.	St
1.7.6	IMO, a big waste of money.	St
1.8.1	I understand your point about upgrading AGP is a waste of money.	St
1.8.2	My system has been glitching a lot, and I am thinking of getting a new one.	St
1.8.3	That way, I won't have to waste that money that would go toword a new system.	St
1.8.4	Thanks for the advice!	St
1.9.1	...you can get a new PCIe motherboard and a pretty decent PCIe card.	St
