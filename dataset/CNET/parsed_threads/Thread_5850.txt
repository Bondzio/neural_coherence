<s> system: intel p-4, 1.4ghz, 256mb rdram, 80gb hdd I replaced a blown power supply in my computer and am unable to get any display whatsoever. </s>
<s> Upon looking at the graphics card I noticed that one of the capacitors was &quot;expanded&quot; (the top seemed to be growing up out of the body of the cap), I'm pretty sure it's blown so I temporarily installed a radeon 9250 from another computer that I know is good and connected to a differant monitor as well to eliminate these 2 as potiential causes of the problem...all I get upon booting up is a blank screen! </s>
<s> Could I have fried the mobo when the old power supply blew? </s>
<s> I am unsure as to how to determine if the mobo is faulty or not. </s>
<s> Any help would be muchly appreciated... </s>
<s> Is anything starting up/spinning up ? </s>
<s> Hard drives, CPU fans, case fans ?? </s>
