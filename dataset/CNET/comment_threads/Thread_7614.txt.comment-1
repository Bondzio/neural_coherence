Hi I have a new (to me) 6 months old computer.
It was built by a friend of a friend.
It has a Asus mainboard and as I say the main drive shows as removable hardware.
It works fine I'm just worried I accidentally hit remove device!
Would I then be in loads of trouble trying to start my PC.Also I would like to know why it shows like this.
Many Thanks J J
