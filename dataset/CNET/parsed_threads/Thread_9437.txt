<s> Hello, Ironically, the HD on my Dell Inspiron failed this week, a day after I started a massive backup effort. </s>
<s> My fault for not doing so more often (a recovery service is currently trying to retrieve portions of my PhD dissertation....). </s>
<s> I want to avoid this headache should (actually, when) I have another failure. </s>
<s> I do have an external drive that is several years old, but it was quite a pain to use and was limited by the size of the files I could transfer. </s>
<s> This leads me to several questions: - Are most external drives formatted the same, or is there a specific feature I should look for in purchasing a new drive? </s>
<s> I remember someone telling me that my file transfer issue was related to the format of the drive. </s>
<s> - What is the most user-friendly method or software to perform regular backups? </s>
<s> For example, I have a new HD coming from Dell. </s>
<s> *IF* I had been backing up my data, is there a way that I could simply install my new HD, plug in the external backup, and it could create an identical replicate of my old HD(files, applications, settings..the works)? </s>
<s> -Related to my last question, I'm looking for a drive that I could simply plug in once a day and execute a backup with little effort on my part. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Can it be scheduled to create a &quot;new&quot; back-up file daily and replace the previous one? </s>
<s> - Can the external drive be organized to both create a daily backup and to have long-term storage for files I don't want taking up space on my laptop? </s>
<s> Or do I need two drives, one devoted to backup and one for long-term storage? </s>
<s> - I read a suggestion in another thread that you should purchase a drive 3-4x the size of the files you want to backup. </s>
<s> Is this accurate? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for your help. </s>
<s> (FYI - I tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what I needed. </s>
<s> I apologize if this has been discussed recently and I missed it.) </s>
<s> Forgot to add - my system runs Vista, if that makes any difference (several older posts referred to software for XP). </s>
<s> In the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'. </s>
<s> I would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas. </s>
<s> The one thing I recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes . </s>
