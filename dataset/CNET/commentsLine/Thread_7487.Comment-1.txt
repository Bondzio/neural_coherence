hey fellas !
i have a new inspiron e1505 notebook with a dvd burner but when i try to copy a dvd i get an error which tell me the blank dvd i've inserted in the drive doesn't has the same format what the driver accept... so i need to insert a right blank dvd.
the dvd driver is suppose to accept dvd-rw (i can read it on the drive) and i've inserted a blank maxell dvd-rw (i can read it on its case)... driver and blank dvd are suposse to be compatibles, but for some reason the system is saying they are from diferent formats.
i am confused... what kind of dvds have i to use !!
i am running roxyo creator 9 in vista home premium.
thanx
