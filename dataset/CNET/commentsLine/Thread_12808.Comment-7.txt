i build my own pc's for a number of reasons: 1. a new pc with the features i build in would cost considerably more.
2. i use ubuntu linux.
most new pc's come with vista or xp pre-installed.
i have no need of these so have no desire to pay royalties to microsoft.
3. in my experience hardware problems are very rare.
most issues that i had problems with back in my windows days related to software weaknesses.
these are also not a problem, and any questions are quickly answered by a very active forum.
i am running a 64bit 6400+ amd dual core processor with a radeon 2600 video.
