1.1.1	I know how stupid this sounds, but I need help with my Epson WorkForce 600.	St
1.1.2	I got a paper jam, which I cleared.	St
1.1.3	I also canceled the printing job.	St
1.1.4	The printer tells me to turn it off after I cleared it.	St
1.1.5	But there is no power button, just a button to stop/clear settings.	St
1.1.6	I pressed that, I pressed the start button, but all I get is flashing green lights.	St
1.1.7	I've look carefully at the booklet, but there is no diagram showing all the parts of the printer.	St
1.1.8	There has to be a power button somewhere.	St
1.1.9	I checked the Epson troubleshooting page, but it's no help.	St
1.1.10	I think I'm going crazy!!!	St
1.1.11	Please help me.	St
1.2.1	But let's talk about clearing those print jobs.	St
1.2.2	It's slightly technical but it is one of the annoying things that I deal with every month.	St
1.2.3	Here's a few articles about it.	St
1.2.4	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=Stop+and+Delete+Print+Jobs+Windows+Vista%2FXP Pick the one you like.	St

1.3.1	Interesting note via the specs as its ENERGY complaint and that means it goes to &quot;sleep&quot; thus it may not have a switch.	Sug
1.3.2	Honestly, you have to look over the unit and go from that.	St
1.3.3	Otherwise, place on a power strip and shutdown 100% that way AFTER you allow it to go to sleep(idle).	St
1.3.4	Basically, the ptr.	St
1.3.5	is using a logic circuit to keep it ON/OFF as I suspect very much like a PC.	St
1.3.6	If that's the case, check for any s/w feature to control that action.	St
1.3.7	That's my best guess as so many printers out there.	St
1.3.8	AND yes, IMHO that's not a good thing.	St
1.3.9	Of course, you can pull the AC plug.	St
1.3.10	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	The power ON/OFF is that button on the frt.	St
1.4.2	top of printer.	St
1.4.3	Press it once to power OFF.	St
1.4.4	If it blinks, etc.	St
1.4.5	for some time allow it to do so, it should finally go OFF.	St
1.4.6	However going OFF maybe more of going to sleep.	St
1.4.7	The manual I quickly reviewed offers that up-to 5min.	St
1.4.8	may pass before it shuts down or sleeps.	St
1.4.9	That could also be related to any error condition as the blinking could refer to an error status(verify).	St
1.4.10	FYI - Power button/switch have the universal symbol of a arched circle with a line and dot in it.	St
1.4.11	Make notice of that on other PC devices, maybe the PC.	St
1.4.12	tada -----Willy	St
