<s> Hi, my computer is getting old so I'm gonna be getting a new one as a birthday/graduation present. </s>
<s> Well anyways I know a fair amount about computers so I have decided to build my own. </s>
<s> These are some of the parts I wanna use for my comp. </s>
<s> But there is still somethings I have not figured out yet. </s>
<s> CPU AMD Athlon 64-bit 90nm 3800+ CPU with &quot;Venice&quot; core MOBO Asus A8V Deluxe Mobo ATHLON64 S939 K8T800PRO DUAL DDR AGP 5PCI SATA 1394 SOUND 1000LAN Video Card eVGA E-GEFORCE 6600GT 128M DDR3 AGP8X VGA DVI HD OUT VIDEO CARD Memory CORSAIR VALUE SELECT DUAL CHANNEL 1024MB KIT PC3200 DDR CAS2.5 2X512MB That's what I've pickeed out so far, I still need a psu(prolly 450-500W would be good), cooling stuff and a case. </s>
<s> BTW, I'll have about $1200 cdn to spend and I allready have mouse/keyboard and a monitor. </s>
<s> So if any one could comment on the choices and reconmend a psu, case and cooling stuff that would be great. </s>
<s> Also tell me if I forgot something that I will also need (Not cd/dvd/floopy tho). </s>
<s> Incase this matters I will probably get this stuff around the end of may so tell me if something good will be coming out by then, that I should consider getting. </s>
<s> TW driver chipset hassle. </s>
<s> SP2 will cause a loop reboot headache. </s>
<s> Safe mode and uninstall SP2. </s>
<s> Same set up here, just slightly diff video card. </s>
<s> Get the Hyperion driver 4.55..... Nvidia 3 or 4 chipset or Intel may be a better &quot;out of the box&quot; solution. </s>
<s> Took several starts before the false temp warnings quit. </s>
<s> --------------------------------- On the other hand, some video operations that took 30 minutes are now reduced to 3 minutes. </s>
<s> Is very fast board using dual channel corsair. </s>
<s> --------------------------------- Since Im using a 2wire modem/router, the worse I ever get is a few cookies. </s>
<s> Hardware firewall. </s>
<s> Yes I use the 3 main tools, spybot, adaware and spyblaster. </s>
<s> So for now no SP2. </s>
<s> --------------------------------- Originally I did a repair install of XP with the new board. </s>
<s> No satisfaction. </s>
<s> Slow boot. </s>
<s> is to get one that has two separate plus 12 volt rails. </s>
<s> One feeds the 4 pin CPU power connector, the other feeds the mobo and drives. </s>
<s> This provides cleaner power to the CPU during high transient conditions. </s>
<s> Don't get confused by seeing the minus 12 volt rail on the supply list [normally 2 amps or less, and no longer used]. </s>
<s> You want two Plus 12 volt outputs listed for the supply, each with substantial current capability. </s>
<s> alright what you need to know is that with dual 12v rail PSU's the 12v rails aren't loaded as much meaning that 15A or 16A on each is perfectly fine that system will run perfectly fine on a good OCZ or Antec PSU providing 24A on the 12v (there-abouts) dual 12v and quad 12v are only good if your going to load a lot of stuff into the machine a 6600GT isn't a high power item things you should consider: A) afaik a Venice 3800 DOES NOT EXIST, so if you could link to what your talking about B) i'd get a 6800nU for PCIE C) Intel does not make Athlon64 support chipsets, and you want the nForce4, not the nForce3, nForce3 has all sorts of problems (it's the first gen for Athlon64, it has various things that cause issues...better than VIA but not by much) D) don't get Intel E) get a HIGH END PSU from Antec, Enermax, OCZ, Fortron Source Power, Sparkle Power or PC Power & Cooling F) make sure that CPU is cooled by a good HSF, Thermaltake anything DOES NOT COUNT AS THAT! </s>
<s> get an XP-90 and 92MM Panaflo High Speed fan...will let that chip run ice cold, meaning it runs more efficiently (does not require higher voltage, i know it sounds weird that higher temp wants more voltage which makes more heat...but if it's running hot it'll need more voltage to stabalize (Why do you think sub-zero allows such nice OC's on any CPU?) </s>
<s> aside from that it's looking nice </s>
<s> Here is where I found it Here is where I found it............... http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=14418&vpn=ADA3800BPBOX&manufacture=AMD </s>
<s> canada gets a new piece of hardware before the US that is a new one...not meant anti-canadian and by out of stock i'm guessing it's on a more of a pre-order status (just a guess) </s>

<s> Hi Kirby, With that powerful and up to date Athlon 64 + 3800 (Venice) CPU, why don't you also go modern and not be outdated soon by switching motherboards to the Asus A8V-E Deluxe with the PCI-Express Technology. </s>
<s> It only costs (NewEgg) $29 more than the Asus A8V Deluxe (AGP). </s>
<s> PCI Express Architecture &quot;PCI Express is the latest I/O interconnect technology that will replace the existing PCI. </s>
<s> With a bus bandwidth 4 times higher than that of AGP 8X interface, PCI Express x16 bus performs much better than AGP 8X in applications such as 3D gaming. </s>
<s> PCI Express x1 also outperforms PCI interface with its exceptional high bandwidth up to 500MB/s. </s>
<s> The high speed PCI Express interface creates new usages on desktop PCs e.g., Gigabit LAN, 1394b, and high-speed RAID systems.&quot; http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-e-d/overview.htm For the video card: The Nvidia GeForce 6600GT PCI-E card is the same price as the AGP (NewEgg low $175). </s>
<s> If you can afford it the 6800GT PCI-E ($379) would be much better. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
