1788	0	262475	2574596	NR	j0hnnyboy	8/31/07 6:18 PM	1.18858428E12	no VGA out?	i bought an ASUS P5GD-1 from here: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=P5GD1-FM2-BULK and, apparently, it doesn't have a VGA out. ??? ??? i already had an old nvidia PCI video card, so i put that into the top PCI slot. so here's the issue i knew i was going to face: how can i change the BIOS settings without a monitor? any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Jon.
