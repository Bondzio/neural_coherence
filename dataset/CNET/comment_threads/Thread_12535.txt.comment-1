Ok, I live in a house with 4 other people each have their own computer.
We have cable internet coming into the house and I was wondering how we would split that connection to all 5 computers.
There are 3 people with desktops that dont need a wireless connection but there are 2 people that have notebooks that want a wireless connection.
What type or router(s) would I need to get so that the computers would split the connection almost evenly?
Or would it just be easier and faster for everyone just to direct connect to a router?
Also what type of speed can we expect for each computer?
Any help would be very much appreciated.
Thanks.
