11261	0	295887	2780154	NR	rapheek	5/24/08 12:20 PM	1.2116316E12	HDD size	Hi, I have a HDD of 300 GB. I installed Windows XP Pro and when I checked the size, I got 195.22 GB usable HD capacity and 192.29 GB HD free space. Any idea how I recover the rest? Thanks

It should say there's 100 Gb unallocated if it really is a 300 Gb drive - What did you tell the partition during the setup of Windows? To use the whole disk? - What does Belarc advisor (free download) say about the disk? Kees

Here is what Belarc advisor says: 104.86 GB Usable Hard Drive Capacity 102.00 GB Hard Drive free space Now I'm using the Disk Manager of XP, created a second partition of 90 GB from the unallocated space, formatted, but still have unallocated space which I cannot format to use as a third partition (the only options right-click gives are &quot;New Partition, Properties and Help&quot;. Here is what I have right now (from Disk Manager) 1- C: 97.66 GB 2- E: 87.89 GB 3- Unallocated space : 93.94 GB. Still have about 20 GB missing (Windows XP should not take that much).

If there's a &quot;New partition&quot; option in your right click, can't you use that to create a new partition (f:) in the unallocated space. Then you've got 3 partitions of about 100 Gb each. The right sequence is first make the partition, then format. &quot;Formatting to use as a new partition&quot;, as you say, is plainly wrong and impossible. That might be part of your problem. It's unclear to me why 'half' of a 300 Gb would become 100 Gb. Maybe your BIOS doesn't handle such a big drive correctly? Do you have reasons to partition the disk? It's not necessary. Windows XP SP2 can easily handle a 300 Gb partition. It might save you some troubles if you redo the install, delete all current partitions and use just one. Kees

I'll just delete all the partitions and redo the install. The reason why I want to partition the HD, is I want to use XP on one partition (C), Windows Server 2003 on the second and Ubuntu on the third. I'll do a quick wipe out with DBAN and reinstall XP. Thanks again.
