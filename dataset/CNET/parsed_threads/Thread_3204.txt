<s> I am installing Windows XP Pro on a two year old laptop that had Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> I have found out that I bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive, one is primary, one is logical. </s>
<s> I want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive. </s>
<s> I am staring from scratch, so none of the files are sacred. </s>
<s> My XP disk does not give the option of merging and I can't afford the $100.00 for Partition Magic. </s>
<s> Are there other options for me out there? </s>
<s> Sony Vio, 36 GB HD, 768 RAM </s>
<s> allow you to remove the partitions and reformat as one partition. </s>
<s> Are you certain that the other partition is not a partition used by the Laptop mfr to store the op sys and all the drivers, and that your CD is actually a restore CD? </s>
<s> Proprietary Systems normally do this, i.e. </s>
<s> Dell, Compaq, Gateway, etc. </s>
<s> Since this is laltop, you should have the orginal restore/recovcery CD if only for the &quot;drivers&quot; needed to make the OS install more complete. </s>
<s> If none or problematic, then going to the laptop makers support website for that model's drivers will be required. </s>
<s> This process takes place after loading the OS. </s>
<s> Ray, pretty covered the OS install process, just load your XP Pro CD and &quot;make sure the CD is 1st boot device in bios&quot;. </s>
<s> Once done, when prompted upon the HD format, make all space available for a &quot;C&quot; drive option or 1 partition. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
