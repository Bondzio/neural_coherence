<s> The nForce 590 SLI Intel chipset from nVidia is the last piece of hardware that I'm waiting on so that I can finally build a core 2 duo system. </s>
<s> Does anyone here have any clue as to its release date? </s>
<s> I heard it had a parallel release with the Conroe line (released to manufacturers Thurs July 27th). </s>
<s> The retail release for the Conroe E6600 and above is August 7th, I believe. </s>
<s> But I have yet to see a definitive release date on the nForce 590 Intel board. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I can't help, at least not now. </s>
<s> I am hoping to build MAximum PC's Dream Machine 2006 and will need an nForce 590 SLI Intel Edition motherboard that can accommodate the Intel Core 2 Extreme X6800 CPU. </s>
<s> If I hear anything I will try to post. </s>
<s> The Maximum PC Dream Machine 2006 looks really nice this year -- you should check out the overclocking on the E6400... http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2802 Hopefully the nForce 590 Intel Edition will come out soon so I can start enjoying conroe! </s>
