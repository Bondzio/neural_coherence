1.1.1	I was wondering how much effect raises your ram does for your pc.	St
1.1.2	Right now i have a 1 gb of PC2100 DDR.	St
1.1.3	My question is if i bought 2 sticks of dual channel ram at PC3200 DDR.	St
1.1.4	would it increase my speed by a large amount.	St
1.1.5	My Specs 2.53 pentuim 1 gb ram 80 gb hard drive 480 power supply radeon 9800 pro	St
1.2.1	You need to verify under your manual or latest info from the vendor/mtrbd.	St
1.2.2	support website what memory can be installed.	St
1.2.3	Then, proceed to get some benefit from faster ram, however it also ties in with the cpu as well as a good match with FSB/speed.	St
1.2.4	Even, if the cpu won't help, the benefit will be there but don't expect a &quot;gee whiz effect&quot;, in other words, &quot;wow&quot;.	St
1.2.5	good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.3.1	ok I read that but friend i want to ask that BY HOW MUCH AMOUNT A DUAL CHANNAL MEMORY INCREASES THE PERFORMENCE AS COMPEARED TO SINGLE CHANNAL, AS I AM PLANNING TO |^ THE MEMORY FROM 256 TO 768 BY ADDING SINGLE STICK OF 512 MB ?	Ques
1.3.2	SHOULD I DO THAT OR PROCEED FOR DUAL CHANNAL MAMRY BY APPLYING 256 +2X128+ 256?	St
