<s> I currently have a Dell Dimension 8250. </s>
<s> My current specs are as follow... </s>
<s> Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.40GHz Memory (RAM): 256 MB Hard drive: 80 GB (in reality, 74.49...) Video card: 128 DDR ATI Radeon 9700 TX w/TV-Out Interestingly, I had no problem playing Splinter Cell 3 on this machine. </s>
<s> However, when I tried to play Far Cry, the game loaded fine (slowly albeit) but the colors and shapes were...well, crazy; hard to explain. </s>
<s> The colors were fine, but it was like looking through a kaleidoscope. </s>
<s> Am I making any sense? </s>
<s> I think I am going to up my memory to 512 MB. </s>
<s> Can I upgrade my graphics card? </s>
<s> Will either of these upgrades void my warranty? </s>
<s> When I purchased the computer, I settled on the extended warranty, and I still have 280 some days left before it runs out. </s>
<s> Any insight is greatly appreciated, Thank you in advance! </s>
<s> Yes it will void your warranty. </s>
<s> Yes the upgrades will void your warranty, but only to a point. </s>
<s> The new hardware will not be covered, but if you have a problem, you can restore the original configuration to have the unit serviced. </s>
<s> (Put the old video card back in & remove the new memory.) </s>
<s> As for upgrading the memory, I hope you have deep pockets because the Dimension 8250 used RDRAM which is very expensive. </s>
<s> RDRAM memory sticks must be installed in matching pairs and 2 sticks of 256MB is currently running between $200 and $250. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
<s> Well, it seems that I have come to a dead end...thanks to both of you for your insight. </s>
<s> It looks as though I might just hold off on upgrading and go ahead with building my own system after all. </s>
<s> Again, many thanks for your help! </s>
<s> Rather than pour money down the drain with an obselete system </s>
