<s> hi i tried installin a cd drive into my computer and after i did my computer cant find the harddrive for bootup... also my new and old cd drives no longer open... i know its not the power supply because i tried a new one... did i fry my motherboard? </s>
<s> Tell me the jumper settings for the hard disk, CDROM and what cable type you used. </s>
<s> Don't know the cable type? </s>
<s> See this link http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html Page down for pictures. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i am using cable select cables for everything... and all jumpers are set to cable select... even if the jumper was set wrong shouldnt the drive still open? </s>
<s> Remove the ide cable and with just the power connected (and power on) does it eject and such? </s>
<s> Sorry for baby steps but the details are not always told... Bob </s>
<s> after i unplugged the ide cable it did open </s>
<s> A bum cable or having a 40 conductor cable is on the suspect list... Bob </s>
<s> thanks you are the man! </s>
<s> replaced cables for hard drive and cd drives and both work now... </s>
<s> Thank you so much i really appreciate it </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Now at startup it is saying secondary drive 1 not found... strike the f1 key to continue, f2 to run the setup utility... when i press f1 it boots up but how do i get ride of that? </s>
