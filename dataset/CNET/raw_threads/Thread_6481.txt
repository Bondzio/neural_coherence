I successfully did it for several PCs. But only in one PC when I try to install windows XP home edition it took lot of time to install OS and installation screen shows it is try to install network drivers. In bottom left hand corner it shows approximately 32 minutes remaining to complete installation. But installation is not proceeding from this point onwards after two hours time also. Then I try to install OS changing default BIOS settings. I disabled onboard LAN and try to install OS. In that case above problem doesnt occur. After installing OS I enabled onboard LAN and try to connect to network but onboard LAN unable to send or receive packets. It takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC and gives message status- Limited or No Connectivity. Then I tried to Repair it, but in that case also I got error mentioning problem in repair IP. I dont think there is problem a with network cable or default gateway, because other computers in network which has same configuration can access internet without any problem. I dont know how to solve this problem. Can you please help me to fix this problem?

That's quite a long post to write and not supply the make/models. If I were to guess I would guess you install Windows but not the motherboard driver package. Bob

It takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC. Then gives message status- Limited or No Connectivity. Then I tried to Repair it, but in that case also I got error mentioning cant repair IP. Also I tried to update network driver using motherboard CD which provided with motherboard. Then I tried to assign IP, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS manually. In that case also it takes lot of time to assign IP address to PC. After I restart PC, IP and other information taken as what I manually set. Then I can ping to 127.0.0.1, machine IP and localhost successfully, but cannot ping to default gateway. I think there is no problem in with network cable or default gateway, because other computers in network which has same configuration can access internet without any problem.

I can share that most drivers on CD are outdated. I've seen the repair fail on the driver from CD and work when we use the fixed driver from the motherboard maker's web site. A complete post could help narrow it down but my guess here is a bum Windows install. Microsoft does not fetch proper drivers. That's for us to do. It's also possible there is some wiring issue to the router or other device. But that's easy to test by using this wiring with a known good machine. Bob
8565	6	163441	1811101	1810838	R. Proffitt	3/16/06 4:40 AM	1.142484E12	That helped. Definitely ....	1. Latest BIOS from ASROCK. 2. Latest Drivers from ASROCK. 3. Test your wiring with another machine. And I don't recall you telling about your network. Bob

Is it possible to work onboard LAN without any problem in one machine and giving problem in other machine which has same software and hardware configurations? That is BIOS version, Driver versions, installed software, RAM, HD, VGA, etc same in both machines. I used same wiring and connect other machine which has same configuration. Then it works without any problem. Therefore I think there is no problem in wiring.
8565	8	163441	1813176	1812894	R. Proffitt	3/17/06 4:00 AM	1.142568E12	Yup. Unlikely to be wiring.	But it almost sounds as if you cloned the hard disk? How odd. Did you not tell something here? And how are those driver updates going? Bob

Just assemble machine using parts. Switch on the machine. Load default BIOS settings. Insert windows XP CD to CDROM and install OS. After finishing OS installation I install drivers for devices which are not correctly installed from OS CD. Then I register and activate windows using internet. Every machine I used auto configure for IP settings.

Beside, Not every MB sold out there are in good condition. Try external Network adaptor... and see if that works... then you know what is the problem..

If you were able to activate then the internet was working at that step. Next time, a firewall, antivirus BEFORE connecting to the internet. Your install method is common, but flawed. You are relying on Microsoft for drivers. Bob
