<s> My problem is such---I want to connect to the internet and have access to a broadband connection. </s>
<s> My neighbor has broadband with two computers, in different rooms, hooked up to it. </s>
<s> My house is around 500 foot from theirs. </s>
<s> I have to be able to get the signal through their wood house, some trees, then through my metal house (travel trailer). </s>
<s> Cat-5 cable and the likes is not an option. </s>
<s> I don't have anything else, other than a computer. </s>
<s> What other equipment might be needed, i.e. </s>
<s> wireless routers, 'weatherproof' (do they make those) wireless routers, etc. </s>
<s> Trying to keep the cost low, but that might be unavoidable. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> So that's dead. </s>
<s> Time to rethink wires. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Okay, sorry. </s>
<s> Need to clarify. </s>
<s> We will run a wire out the window to the outside. </s>
<s> We just have to get past the distance dilemma from my house to their's (plus trees). </s>
<s> Sorry for the lack of clarity. </s>
<s> Poor wireless. </s>
<s> Seems you need to think wired again. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> We managed to catch the neighbor's broadband signal. </s>
<s> Had to install the software. </s>
<s> We are able to get on the net, but the signal is pretty low. </s>
<s> Right now, I'm at 11 Mbps. </s>
<s> My husband says the closer he gets to the neighbor's house, the better it gets (of course.) </s>
<s> Keep in mind, we're in a metal house. </s>
<s> Is it possible to amplify this signal, in an affordable way? </s>
<s> The metal wall. </s>
<s> Here's some other ideas. </s>
<s> http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/ Bob </s>
<s> You are needing a High Gain Directional Antenna. </s>
<s> You would probably be best going with the same brand as the router, but any one should do. </s>
<s> The D-Link I've linked to below is about $150, but says it will go about 2.5 miles! </s>
<s> I know you don't need that distance, but that should be strong enough to punch through some trees. </s>
<s> http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=55 </s>
<s> I'm going to rig up one of the wifi 'devices' that Bob showed me on the page he sent. </s>
<s> The question, now, is, which USB adapter should we go with? </s>
<s> On the Dell website, under wireless network USB adapters (search), I've got these three I'm looking at Wireless G Plus MIMO USB Network Adapter by Belkin Wireless-G USB Network Adapter with Wi-Fi Finder by Linksys WUSB54GSC Wireless-G USB Adapter with SpeedBooster Technology also by Linksys I didn't get a lot of reviews on any of them, but the Belkin one comes in on top because of the 1000 foot range. </s>
<s> Didn't really come up with much else. </s>
<s> Any user reviews, comments, etc on any of these? </s>
<s> They range from $64-$80. </s>
<s> I'd like to try and get a good one the first time around. </s>
<s> You know how some company's get kinda touchy about returns. </s>
<s> Any input will be greatly appreciated!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> www.geeks.com Why? </s>
<s> It was going outside and since it will age fast and possible die I decided to go cheap. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was wondering if all these were going to be expensive. </s>
<s> Only thing is, will a cheaper one travel the 400 ft to the router as good as a pricey one? </s>
<s> I sure don't want to screw up a good one. </s>
<s> We're actually planning to bring it in when we're not using it. </s>
<s> How long has yours lasted? </s>
<s> I don't want to keep getting $10 ones that die. </s>
<s> Also, what's the name of the one you got form geeks? </s>
<s> I search for usb wifi adapters and I still get $65+ price range. </s>
<s> Those come and go. </s>
<s> Since I'm done and I had no reason to perform benchmarks, tests or build a web site about it all I can share is it does work. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob PS&gt; geeks.com is a clearance item sort of place. </s>
<s> It would do no good for me to share what I used since it will never be found there again. </s>
