You'll see a huge difference once you upgrade it to a more modern processor. Also, note that the type of RAM you get matters. DDR2 is a bit faster than the older DDR; dual-channel is better than shared. The speed of the RAM will make a difference as well. -Jason

3480	5	117586	1335656	1335085	Willy	8/2/05 8:26 AM	1.12297116E12	Try looking at...	Get rid of the old HD, once you transfer any data, etc. to the new HD(suggest you partition the new HD into at least 2). Come on, you got 160gb new HD and you're keeping a 6gb around. The old HD probably is slowing down the old channel ways and the HD can't show its full potential or at least be its best. Added ram really does help but don't expect leaps and bounds of improvement it can just flex it muscles abit more. The cpu if possible should be considered for a replacement upgrade as that's the last area to look into. The combo of cpu and ram should make a notricable improvement but again, its not leaps and bounds. tada -----Willy

I know that DELL Techs told me that not all brands of memory will work on DELL MB's cos DELL doesnt support all brands. For example from DELL tech. If your MB supports DDR 3200, doesnt mean that you can get DDR 3200 from any company out there cos that company may not made that memory for DELL. Dont know if that is really true but that is what DELL Techs told me more than once. Well dont know if thats help, just wanted 2 say what was on my mind.

Perform the procedure at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx You can't look at this and know it's in the best DMA mode. You must perform the procedure.

The system has to slow down to accomodate that old hard drive, and no matter how much ram you add, or how fast the CPU is, it can't run any faster than that drive can handle the data I/O. Check your system manual. If you can upgrade your CPU at least two steps then do so. If you can upgrade RAM to let you utilize faster ram, do so, and max it out. Replace that old drive with a 7200 or 10,000 rpm drive that has the largest buffer you can find. You may need to flash the BIOS to enable the system to handle such changes. If you are unable to flash the BIOS, and your system can't handle at least a two step increase at the CPU level, chances are that no matter what you do to it is not going to help much overall. If that's the case, time to buy a new system (better yet, build it yourself).

Go to the Viking Memory website and use their memory finder to see what is correct for that Dell. They have excellent product at a fair price, and its guaranteed to work.

My first question involves the fact of your computer being older. Was your XP an upgrade? If you're still running FAT32, I suggest a full reinstall, using the upgrade disc. I did exactly that to a client's box, and made a HUGE difference. Upgrading over 98 or ME is not recommended anywhere I've been. Upgrade or not, there are all sorts of slowdowns you need to look at. Spyware first, run Ad-aware, and Spybot S&D after updating them. I would also install Spywareblaster for future nasties. Next is registry. Download RegSeeker, make a folder on C:, and unzip it there. Click on the .exe, then &quot;Scan the Registry&quot;, and watch the magic. I'm really surprized at the lack of recommendations for a good registry cleaner everywhere I go. I couldn't live without it. I use it on all the computers I service, and it ALWAYS finds 500 to over 1000 bad entries and keys. I run it almost daily on my own boxes, and it never fails to find 5 to 50. Anyway, your older computer should still serve you well, modern games aside. Especially with XP. Your memory upgrade should have provided a small boost, not extremely noticeable. No offense to others, but you are probably running PC133, and can't run PC3200 or any other DDR without a major hardware change. If the memory you installed is recognized in the BIOS and &quot;System Properties&quot;, you are fine. Now, WinXP has all kinds of bloated crap I always shut down. Windows Messenger, Balloon Tips, Auto Update, &quot;Scan for network drives&quot;, Remote desktop and assistance, Show newly installed programs, Shared folders, Recycle bin, all unnecessary background runners, and many other things go flying out the &quot;Window&quot;! Try these things and see how much faster your &quot;Good 'ole computer&quot; runs.

Compaq tells me I can upgrade using any combination of ram and since I have 3 slots, I can add 3-512mb rams, which I will be doing one at a time. my ram is a PC133 SDRAM, my chip is a P4-1.5GZ Intel 845 and bus architecture of PCI.

I have XP Home Edition and 512 MB of RAM. It seemed like things wasn't happening fast enough for what I wanted. I worked with Dell, whom I purchased my puter from, and they had me check this and that and to no avail. So I upgraded my hard drive from 18.6 gigs to 40. STILL did not help. I have a friend who is a tech for Microsoft and after working with him, determined that possibly my ISP was the problem. After doing the &quot;speed test&quot; from Verizon, ( www.infospeed.verizon.net ), I found out that Verizon had not upgraded my speed. I contacted them and my speed was doubled!!! Hope this helps.

Spyware??? Your new hard drive is ATA133 but your PC could be ATA64 or even ATA32. There is a Bible verse that goes &quot;don't put new wine into old wine skins&quot; I feel that this can apply to PC as well. New PCs are 5 to 6 times faster than your curent PC. John

I added a 256mb card from Crucial and that helped some. I then decided to get a newer video card and another stick of 256mb (again from crucial) I'll tell you what, that made quite a difference. Your optiplex is much the same as my dimension so i imagine this would be good for you. If that Optiplex is anything like my Dimension, then you have a nVidia tnt2 video card, i upgraded to a nVidia GeForce 4 440mx card with 64mb onboard ram. and i did loose the 128mb ram card (i had a snaileron pc that i was using to tinker with linux on and it, too, needed more ram;-))

But when I had my Dell 550MHz computer, Dell told me I had to have it match. If I put in a 256 in one slot the other slot had to have 256. My New Dell 3.05GHz can be mixed and right now are mixed. And that is how it was installed from the Factor.

It's your old hard drive that slowing things, besides the fact, the PC is too old to do the things you are expecting. Kind of like, welding a microwave to a cast iron stove. One can't do anything for the other.

Your old architecture can only improve a bit adding memory, faster drive, and newer OS is much more dependent on chip, bus and I/O spends to perform. Eliminate all unnecessary services, configure one fixed page file of 3 or 4 times your RAM for best web page cache; no step, XP wants to check and recalculate the used cache... and keep the reg clean, spyware checked and defraged as everyone mentioned. If you really want life out of the machine, try Linux - Eudora or other flavor... I liked Red-Hat on my old system - manage as dns, dhcp & printer server just fine. Cough up 499 for a new DELL!

You 've installed good stuff , but have you have cleared out the cache, properly reformatted your HD and thrown away old files? You might try a clean reinstall of your OS. Also clear out your Pram. How do you this things? I have no idea on a Wintel. I'm a Mac guy and I'm laughing my ass off! Tell me, do you also paint walls in your house without washing or prepping them first? mac or windows, you must prep your CPU BEFORE installing the upgrade! Putting upgrades on a computer not ready for them is like putting lipstick on a Pig.....nice try, but a wasted effort and strange behavior at best.
