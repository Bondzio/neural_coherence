1.1.1	I 'm a novice computer building and I 'm trying to update my old Dell Dimension 4600 ( circa 2003 ) .	St
1.1.2	The original system had the following : 2.66 GHz Pent 4 512 MB RAM 40GB HDD I had added the following during the course of its life span : eGeForce 6600 AGP , 256 MB 300GB Hard Disk To help improve its sluggish speed , I recently upgraded the ram from 512MB ( 2 sticks of 256MB DDR , PC2700 ) to 2GBS ( 2 sticks of 1GB DDR , PC2700 ) .	St
1.1.3	After installing the RAM , I 've been encountering numerous problems .	St
1.1.4	These problems include the BSOD , numerous crashing , tons of Win32 errors , and just about all programs closing to due to fatal errors .	St
1.1.5	I 've run memtest on both sticks of RAM together as well as each stick independently for about 2 hours each .	St
1.1.6	All the scans revealed indicated the memory was fine .	St
1.1.7	I attempted to reinstall windows xp , but it locked up about 3/4 of the way through ( after it got to & quot ; installing devices & quot ; ) .	St
1.1.8	I eventually replaced the old original RAM and was able to finish the windows install , but I 'm hesitant to add the new RAM back .	St
1.1.9	Does anyone have any insights ito what may be causing all these problems ?	Ques
1.1.10	One idea I got from perusing these boards is a lack of power ?	Ques
1.1.11	The power supply in the tower has an output of 250W .	St
1.1.12	Would this new RAM ( 4x the original ) be too much for the supply ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thank you so much for your help !	St
1.2.1	Does the motherboard support two Gig of RAM ?	Ques
1.2.2	All things considered , two Gig is major overkill .	St
1.2.3	Have you tried with one stick of the new RAM ?	Ques
1.2.4	If things are normal , swap the sticks .	St
1.2.5	If it fails , you have a bad stick .	St
1.2.6	If it works , the motherboard may not support two Gig .	St
1.2.7	Have you looked at the BIOS ?	Ques
1.2.8	There may be settings for that much RAM if it is supported .	St
1.3.1	It runs smoother with just one stick in at a time .	St
1.3.2	The BIOS indicates that it can run the two gigs , but I 'm not certain if I 'm checking the correct area .	St
1.3.3	In looking around at my system specs , it appears that this model dell can run up to 2gigs .	St
1.4.1	Suspect the system is not designed to run reliably with two 1GB DIMMs ( need mfg , series and model # to verify ) or RAM settings in BIOS need to be tweaked .	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	The System is a DELL Dimension 4600 .	St
1.5.2	The system specs state that the motherboard is designed to handle up to 2 GBs of RAM .	St
1.5.3	I recieved this information from Dell 's Website .	St
1.5.4	Also , when i have the RAM installed , it registers as 2GBs .	St
1.5.5	Where would I need to double check to make sure this is correct ?	Ques
1.6.1	http : //www.crucial.com/ Use the finder and input your PC 's specs .	St
1.6.2	Crucial will tell you what you need .	St
1.6.3	As another/repeat thought , two Gig is still waaaaaayyy overkill .	St
1.6.4	Unless you 're mapping the human genome you 'll never use or need two Gig .	St
1.6.5	If it works with one Gig , return the other stick .	St
1.6.6	I really forsee problems in trying to make this work .	St
1.6.7	If the PC was happy with two Gig , we would n't be having this conversation .	St
1.7.1	This RAM was recommended by their advisor .	St
1.7.2	The amount was also recommended .	St
1.7.3	Do you have any opinion regarding the potential power source problem ?	Ques
1.8.1	it runs better with one stick than two .	St
1.8.2	Have you tried each individual stick to make sure one is n't bad ?	Ques
1.8.3	No , just because it 's new does n't mean it 's GOOD .	St
1.8.4	Are you sure you handled them with care , or that you were properly grounded when you installed the ram , or touched other components ?	Ques
1.8.5	Did you make sure the RAM slots are clean of dirt and dust and the Ram connectors are clean as well ?	Ques
1.8.6	Are you sure it is n't the graphics card ?	Ques
1.8.7	You said it was running sluggish before .	St
1.8.8	While 512 is n't top end , I have't seen too many computers run THAT sluggish on 512 unless it had other issues.Are you sure your cpu fan\heat sink are clear of dust and dirt as well ?	Ques
1.8.9	I may not have caught what Power supply you have , what wattage is it ?	Ques
1.8.10	Paul	St
1.9.1	Your 250w psu is getting a little light .	St
1.9.2	I ca n't think of a good reason why 2 sticks of 1GB would consume more power than 2 sticks of 256MB but keep the psu in mind .	St
1.9.3	Memtest for 2 hrs on 2GB of memory might not tell you much ... .let it run for 24hrs+ .	St
1.9.4	Since your working with an old clunker check the maker for any bios/mobo updates that might address this issue .	St
1.9.5	Consider the possibility that 3/4 yrs ago no normal person put 2GB into a machine , so the maker did n't spend a lot of time making that work .	St
1.9.6	Crucial is talking about installing in pairs so I 'll assume dual channel .	St
1.9.7	What happens if you install in single channel mode ?	Ques
1.10.1	I 'm 99 % sure the ram is good .	St
1.10.2	I ran memtest on both sticks , indpendently , for 2 hours .	St
1.10.3	The RAM appears to be fine .	St
1.10.4	I 'm using a 250 Watt source , which may be the problem .	St
1.11.1	OK on the quantitiy of RAM ( 2GB ) what about the BIOS . ?	Ques
1.11.2	Is BIOS the current version ? ?	Ques
1.11.3	VAPCMD	St
1.12.1	Thanks for the tip about memtest .	St
1.12.2	I 've run the RAM in single channel mode and I get less errors , still not error free unfortunately .	St
1.12.3	The reason I suspect the power supply is that I recently ( within the last 6 months ) added a few power draining components .	St
1.12.4	A 256MB video card ( which specifies needing a PSU of at least 300 ) and a 300GB hard drive .	St
1.12.5	I was unaware of the strenght of the power supply and adding 4x 's the RAM may have been enough to drain all the power .	St
1.12.6	Is that a fair assumption ?	Ques
1.12.7	Thanks for your help !	St
1.13.1	Yup , the BIOS is the most recent .	St
1.13.2	The motherboard is a Dell 02Y832 .	St
1.13.3	250 Watt PSU	St
1.14.1	The symptoms you are describing sound more like a result of a partition failure in you hard drive .	St
1.14.2	This is usually caused by a virus .	St
1.14.3	I would download a heavy virus scanner like Panda True Prevent , run it , and see what manifests itself .	St
1.14.4	People get complacent with Virus protection .	St
1.14.5	If you do n't have a problem with that , go to Crucial Technologies and run the Memory scanner .	St
1.14.6	Crucial 's stuff works .	St
1.14.7	I 'd almost bet that a virus has slipped in the back door of your current AVP and screwed up your hard drive .	St
