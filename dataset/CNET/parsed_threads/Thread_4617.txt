<s> With so many years-old 35 mm slides I want to scan them and create .jpegs using my new Canon PIXMA 610 multi function printer/scanner/copier. </s>
<s> Does anyone reading this have any idea whether this is possible? </s>
<s> I tried raising the resolution to the maximum of 600 and scanned the slides as color photos. </s>
<s> THAT definitely did not work. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance to anybody who may have knowledge about this. </s>
<s> Some scanners have an adapter for scanning slides and even negatives. </s>
<s> They have to capture light passing through and not reflected from an image. </s>
<s> They also need software to accommodate this kind of scanning feature. </s>
<s> I have used such and my old HP 5470 has a slide/negative adapter. </s>
<s> I can tell you that the quality is only so-so but it does work. </s>
<s> Yes, I have discovered that my very new Canon PIXMA will NOT acommodate my need....(sigh). </s>
<s> I am going to take the slides to a professional, who will make prints and also digitize them on a CD, so I can at least be able to manipulate them! </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
