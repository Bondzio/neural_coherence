<s> I've set up the following DC's on virtual machines: On DC1 you set the IPv4 settings are: IP: BLANK Gateway: BLANK Primary DNS: 127.0.0.1 Secondary DNS: 192.168.0.1 (Broadband Router) What IPv4 settings settings do I enter on DC2 so as it points at DC1? </s>
<s> IP: Gateway: Primary DNS: Secondary DNS: Any help would be greatly appreciated? </s>
<s> That seems odd unless the host is also running some DNS (server) It's also odd to have a router do the DNS work. </s>
<s> Didn't you discover that had other issues. </s>
<s> I won't list them all but here's an old favorite. </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.michaelhanscbsi.com/eclecticism/2003/11/07/belkin-routers-hijacking-websurfing/ The industry seems to have fixed that but other issues we bumped into had me use the real DNS instead of the routers. </s>

<s> Just figured out that the IP settings above may be for my laptop, if so what IP settings should I use on DC1? </s>
<s> BTW, I hope you avoid using acronyms since my guess might be wrong as I look over http://www.acronymfinder.com/DC.html Running a domain controller in a VM is interesting but there is no one correct answer as what we are trying to do can change the answer. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes I mean Domain Controller in a virtual test environment. </s>
<s> What about my IP settings. </s>
<s> Could do with an answer on that as its driving me nuts. </s>
<s> Was without known why we are putting a domain controller in a VM we can't know what to do with it. </s>
<s> Since it would not be to fielded as a DC then you can use the host's IP assignments. </s>
<s> That is, I installed W2008 in Virtual Box and never changed from what the host DHCP'd. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Change known to knowing. </s>
<s> -&gt; There is no single correct answer here. </s>
<s> The staffer gets to design and implement this according to the client's desire. </s>
