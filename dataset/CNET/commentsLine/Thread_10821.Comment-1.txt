i am planning to buy a bluetooth donlge for my laptop, but then wondered: would it be possible to connect my phone to my laptop (via the cable or infra-red) and then use the bluetooth on the phone, making my phone itself the bluetooth dongle.
unleashing it's power to my laptop.
i have a nokia 6230, a toshiba equium laptop (with usb and infra red), a nokia connectivity cable and windows xp home sp2 any tech-wizard up for the challenge?
