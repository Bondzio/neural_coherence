the graphics card is not the long pole when editing video.
the cpu is - either when importing or rendering a dvd.
yes, video functionality is needed - and to answer the original post question directly, the cheapest mac to edit video on is the macmini, and when importing standard definition, everything would be fine - and the video card is hardly used... even the video in the imovie window would hardly get it breathing hard (even if it is highdef) but rendering the edited video out to a dvd or whatever flavor quicktime movie or avi or mpeg4 or other format goes frame-by-frame and *that* needs cpu cycles (and ram) big time.
you are correct, upgrading the video card in an imac is not a field mod most folks want to do (or can do and continue to have the mac under warranty).
you are correct that the larger imac has a better video card.
you are also correct that the macpro tower has available slots for video cards (among other things), but the macpro tower is not the &quot;cheapest mac that will edit video&quot;.
