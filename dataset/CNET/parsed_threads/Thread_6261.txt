<s> Ribbon got broken almost immediate after printer mechanism gets moving. </s>
<s> It doesn't even require to actually print anything to get ribbon broken. </s>
<s> It's just enough to pull the paper towards and when both media and ribbon mechanism starts to rolling ribbon will rub off just above head starting from left to right. </s>
<s> Problem does not occur when I manually turn ribbon spindle (instead of paper) which also automatically makes paper spindle to move. </s>
<s> In that scenario ribbon doesn't got broke. </s>
<s> It must be some mechanical damage but I can't figure out what kind of. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> What no details other than Zebra printer, MODEL# ??? </s>
<s> Sometimes you have to observe operation and with a printer its easier than most. </s>
<s> It probably has a cover sw. that won't allow operation if open. </s>
<s> If so, then tape or somehow jam the sw. down as if it were closed -or- if applicable put into service position. </s>
<s> You can remove cover if not enough space to view operation. </s>
<s> If you have a ribbon as you state then it's suppose to advance during operation to use new area of ribbon in order best print. </s>
<s> Either than sw. or toggle is broken, loose, jammed or the logic that drives it is hosed. </s>
<s> You have to figure out which. </s>
<s> Since this happens immediately during your power-ON, that suggests its trying to take slack out of ribbon in order to be tight against printhd. </s>
<s> or similar. </s>
<s> Again, one of the above conditions applies. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks, I've solved the problem. </s>
<s> It was preety simple, I'm just to noob to figure it out. </s>
<s> Ribbon was pressed to the far end on the roller and was rubbed by some parts of printer body. </s>
<s> Taking it back out on roller for about 3-5mm solved it. </s>
<s> However if you put it back to far it will be missing ribbon sensor, so that't not gonna work either. </s>
<s> Printer is Zebra 170Xiii Plus. </s>
<s> I hope that the ribbon was indeed intended for that model# use. </s>
<s> -OR- the roller/spindle isn't too worn or it's &quot;key&quot; to handle the roll is crisp and not worn. </s>
<s> If this has been used for some extended time, the wear&tear could allow some slop as it were. </s>
<s> These are pretty robust printers but users do tend to wear them out. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
