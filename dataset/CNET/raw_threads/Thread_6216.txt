I have an old IBM NetVista which I purchased in 2002 - it's worked well, until the last month. Only thing different was changing to an optical mouse. Then the PC started freezing and shutting down. So I took it to a local repair shop. I have been running Norton 360 and thought that it did a disk clean up and defrag automatically - it doesn't- They clean up the hard drive and I saw it there booting up fine. Now I got it at home, re-hooked up everything - and it's the same exact periperals it came with - except for the optical wireless mouse. When I turn the pc on - it works - the fan runs and I can hear it start up and beep (2 beeps) - but nothing works - not the monitor, the mouse, the speakers, the printer, nothing. I know it's getting power because the internet connector lights up. Can anyone help? Thank you
