the hp seems to have a better processor and much larger hard drive.
i plan on playing some games such as cod4 and using photoshop cs3.
i would also like to have the option to have the tv tuner thing which the hp has and the dell charges extra for.
seem like a better buy with the hp but the dell may let me expand more down the road easily.
any experience or ideas are appreciated?
