I run Windows 7 Pro. My Problem: The CDs I burn on this player will not play on my car CD player (Subaru 2001 Forrester.) The burned CD will play on my daughters' cars (2003 and 2008 Ford models) and all other players around the house. Could it be that my Subaru player is just to old? Are there any types of adjustments I can make while burning the disc to solve this problem?? Help! and Thanks...........
