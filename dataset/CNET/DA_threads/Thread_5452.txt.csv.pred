1.1.1	My desktop , running XP Pro , has the above mentioned video card .	St
1.1.2	I 've had it for about a year without any problems , everything updated fine from the installation CD and from Windows Update there after .	St
1.1.3	A week ago however , I decided to reformat my PC , something I 've done a few times , again without any big problems .	St
1.1.4	This time however , the video drivers ( and monitor drivers as well as a result of this ) fail to install .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried using the CD again , but after installation and restart , my pc will freeze during Windows loading screen ( at the agp40 or similar loadup command ) .	St
1.1.6	I went online to get the latest drivers , but installation fails as it does not recognize any valid hardware .	St
1.1.7	There 's a hotfix on AMD 's website for this series , which I 've tried , but it 's the same result as the CD .	St
1.1.8	I 've also tried using generic VGA drivers as some troubleshooting guides recommend , but this again will only lead to my screen freezing at loadup .	St
1.1.9	Finally , Windows Update itself does not recognize the hardware either , so I 'm not getting any updates for it , nor is the Automatic Driver search working on it .	St
1.1.10	Any help on is appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	and it went OK the previous time you did exactly the same , I 'm thinking of a hardware failure .	St
1.2.2	Try once more from the start .	St
1.2.3	If no luck again , see if you still can find another AGP card .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	Yes , the only difference I can think of was that I had an older ATI card before , with its drivers and catalyst .	St
1.3.2	But even then , I had to install the drivers from the CD .	St
1.3.3	I tried it again , this time using the ATI driver found on this site , but the same thing happens .	St
1.3.4	Windows freezes at the same command line .	St
1.3.5	I just went through some boxes and I found my old ATI , so I 'll load it up again and see if I can get those drivers to work .	St
1.3.6	Would there be any issues if I then try to load the HD2400 again as an upgrade to see if it 'll be recognized then ?	Ques
1.4.1	prior to the reformat , there were n't any apparent problems with my video .	St
1.4.2	The main reason for doing it was that my system performance was being slowed down by a number of programs that I did n't use any more and I prefer full cleanup when there are a lot of these programs rather than just uninstalling them and encountering errors later on .	St
1.5.1	install the mobo chipset driver first BEFORE installing the VGA driver ?	Ques
1.5.2	If you have the mfr provided driver CD , they usually have it autostart and then you follow the installation sequence from top to bottom .	St
1.6.1	I did a clean windows install when I reformatted , do n't have a chipset driver .	St
1.6.2	I did check for available bios updates , but the only one available was for the pc series I have , but not for the model itself ( it mentioned 'specific for ... ' .	St
1.6.3	I 've never had to reinstall those particular drivers before , so I might be missing something there .	St
1.6.4	How would I go about finding this information ?	Ques
1.7.1	I read your post twice and missed the make , model of the machine so I ca n't offer a link to that driver .	St
1.7.2	But that message also happens if you download the ATI drivers .	St
1.7.3	For AGP you have to find the AGP HOTFIX drivers from ATI .	St
1.7.4	The ones you find are only for PCIE so be sure you get the AGP HOTFIX and absolutely get that motherboard package installed first .	St
1.8.1	It 's a Compaq 7000 7RPM11 .	St
1.8.2	As for the AGP hotfix , yea found those and they cause the freeze at startup , same with any older or generic drivers .	St
1.8.3	The PCIe were the ones that failed to recongnize the hardware ( as mentioned in the hotfix ) and would not install at all .	St
1.9.1	http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList ? os=228 & lc=en & dlc=en & cc=us & product=240442 & lang=en I see this used the Intel chipset .	St
1.9.2	If so , this is a link to a Compaq driver required .	St
1.9.3	http : //download.cnet.com/sp25336-exe/3000-2122_4-111586.html Sorry but the model DID NOT tell what I needed to know to find the Intel.com drivers I would install .	St
1.9.4	Let me ask this .	St
1.9.5	- & gt ; Which Intel chipset did this machine use ?	Ques
1.9.6	Bob	St
1.10.1	has nVidia UMA onboard http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList ? os=228 & lc=en & dlc=en & cc=us & product=240442 so your ATI is an upgrade .	St
1.10.2	Do a clean XP install without the ATI inserted , then insert the ATI to let PnP detect it , then install the ATI driver .	St
1.11.1	Sorry , have n't dealt with chipset info , I think it 's the firmware that you are asking for , but just in case I listed the rest of the info : Intel 82801BA LPC Interface Controller -2440 82801BA/BAM SMBus Controller -2443 82801BA/CA PCI Bridge -244E 82802 Firmware Hub Device 82850 Processor to I/O Controller -2530 82850/82860 Processor to AGP Controller -2532 Even if I have to reinstall without the HDcard , I 'd appreciate this info , as I 'm thinking it 'll be a good idea to update whatever 's outdated anyways .	St
1.11.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.12.1	http : //www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/cs-009238.htm Go get em .	St
