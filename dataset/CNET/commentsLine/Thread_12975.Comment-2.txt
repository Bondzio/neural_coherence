i have a two year old hp media center computer.
i ran out and purchaed the windows vista home upgrade the day it came out.
so far, the only issues that i've had are compatibility issues (drivers, software, etc).
i've not had any blue screen events, no error messages, nothing like that.
i've restored media center a couple of times, but i always go back to vista.
i like the way it looks, and my computer seems to boot up faster.
sounds like your issues could be the computer itself, out of the box.
