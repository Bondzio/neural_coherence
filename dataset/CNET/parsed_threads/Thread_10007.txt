<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> I have a desktop that is having internet connection problems, and I'd like to connect it to my laptop so I can download some anti-spyware software and scan that machine. </s>
<s> I guess I'm saying I'd like to use the desktop as an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I think it will make the whole process easier. </s>
<s> I'd preferably like to do this through a usb cable (because that is what I own). </s>
<s> In my mind this should work... but I don't want to try it and end up messing up one of the machines. </s>
<s> Thanks, Java Trish </s>
<s> Are you trying to fix the desktop machine or just use it as a file server? </s>
<s> Certainly you can network the two and use the connection to transfer software and bypass the need to connect the ailing machine to the internet. </s>
<s> Is there strong reason to suspect spyware is the major cause of it's problems and are you attempting to repair and return it to active duty?...or just leave it as a server. </s>
<s> This could affect the responses you will get. </s>
<s> Sorry that I wasn't too clear. </s>
<s> I am trying to fix the internet connection on the desktop. </s>
<s> I plan to download some items (anti-spyware software and winsockfix.exe) and run them on that machine. </s>
<s> I guess I'm just trying to skip the middleman of putting the apps from my laptop to a jump drive or cd, and just transferring it straight from my laptop to the desktop. </s>
<s> I do not intend this to be a permanent thing (ie I'm not going to use it as a file server). </s>
<s> As I mentioned before, I'd like to do this via USB, if possible. </s>
<s> I suspect it is spyware, or possibly a break in the TCP/IP chain because this machine had previously communicated online, and now cannot, even with a new modem. </s>
<s> For more info on that, you can check out my other post at: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7584-0.html?forumID=63&threadID=61372&messageID=728204 Anyway, I had done some research on this problem, and would like to try some things out. </s>
<s> The irony in this is that not having an internet connection makes it all that more difficult. </s>
<s> I hope that information helps. </s>
<s> Thanks, Java Trish </s>
<s> from the message link provided, you have quite a task. </s>
<s> Yes, a USB cable should work if the ports are configured on both. </s>
<s> And, if both are XP, there are wizards to assist. </s>
<s> You will be creating a network. </s>
<s> You will need to, not only connect them, but get them to agree to communicate. </s>
<s> You do not need to transfer AV and spyware programs but can install them right from the other machine if the installation executable is available. </s>
<s> As for the problem getting on line, this is another issue. </s>
<s> I am guessing that the &quot;data&quot; you see coming across is just the communication overhead and not really useful bytes of information. </s>
<s> Good luck and post your progress. </s>
<s> Great! </s>
<s> Thanks for the information! </s>
<s> I will be connectiong the two machines (yes, both are XP), this evening, and will hopefully be able to fix the problem. </s>
<s> I spent 8 hours working on it last weekend, with no success. </s>
<s> I have a few more battle plans this time around, so hopefully things will work out. </s>
<s> I will update my progress. </s>
<s> Thanks, Java Trish </s>
<s> by banging my head against a problem until it's resolved, or so messed up that no one can fix it. </s>
<s> :) That relentlessness alone has plenty of value. </s>
<s> Even if I give up, I have probably learned something I can use later. </s>
<s> Keep at it and good luck. </s>
<s> Please post back any further needs as there are plenty of folks here willing to take a shot at about anything. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> It turns out after all of that, I didn't even have the cable with me to connect the two machines. </s>
<s> So... </s>
<s> I just ended up transferring things via my jump drive. </s>
<s> Thank you for the information, though, because it was something I had been wondering about, anyway. </s>
<s> It ended up taking me another 4 hours to get it up and running, but that is mostly because I had to download things over a dial-up connection. </s>
<s> Anyway, if you want to hear all the gory details about it, you can read about it on my other post: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7584-0.html?forumID=63&threadID=61372&messageID=742320 Thanks again! </s>
