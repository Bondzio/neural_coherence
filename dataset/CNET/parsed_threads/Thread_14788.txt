<s> Hello, I have recently installed Windows 98 SE on my computer and don't have any sound. </s>
<s> It showed my sound card in the device manager, but there were no playback devices listed under Multimedia in the Control Panel. </s>
<s> Now, after trying to uninstall and reinstall the sound card driver many times, I do not show the sound card listed in the device manager, and I have not been able to get a playback device to show in Multimedia no matter what I have tried: changing Bios configuration under Audio from Auto to Enabled to Disabled to Auto uninstalling and reinstalling driver and updated drivers reinstalling Multimedia in Windows 98 I am contemplating reformatting my hard disk drive and reinstalling Windows &quot;from scratch&quot;, but I'm not sure what to do differently this time from the last time I did this. </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> &quot;HP Pavilion computer converted from Windows XP to Windows 98 SE&quot; Some HP computers that came with XP have NO WINDOWS 98 driver. </s>
<s> You would use one from hp.com (click on the drivers link), but a few and even moreso now will never see a Windows 98 driver. </s>
<s> The fix is to disable the onboard audio and install a sound card with 98 drivers. </s>
