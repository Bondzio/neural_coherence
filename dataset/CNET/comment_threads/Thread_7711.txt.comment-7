wow, can we say someone got a little spend happy?
6GB is far and beyond what any application can realistically use, but hey, here's to being set for the next 2 years RAM-wise I'd still say go with the 8800GT, if you want a little more oomph look at the G92 based 8800GTS, its a tad faster, tad more expensive, not a bad card at all (its around $330, so about $40-$60 more than the GT, and its worth that $40-$60 more, vs the GTX which is around $200 more, and is worth about $55-$70 more)
