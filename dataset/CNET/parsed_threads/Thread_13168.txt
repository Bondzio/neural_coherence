<s> I am an avid gamer in my spare time, as most of you likely know latency(ping) is a major factor in online gaming. </s>
<s> Recently I noticed my ping has doubled and tripled to some gaming servers including ones located only about 150 miles away. </s>
<s> I also noticed the most change in servers that were very close by. </s>
<s> A ping test to a server not 30 miles away had shown my ping had jumped from the normal 20-30ms to 90-110ms overnight. </s>
<s> So I did all the basics, reset and reconfigured my router, made sure I didn't have an EMI issue. </s>
<s> Nothing worked, so I did a tracert. </s>
<s> The results are weird, my ISP is using a route clear on the other side of the states from me starting at hop 4. </s>
<s> I live in north Florida, iptrace shows this to be in Minnesota. </s>
<s> Ideas on the cause and how I might fix this? </s>
<s> Haven't had the chance to contact my ISP yet and I get a sneaking feeling that contacting them won't be much help anyway. </s>
<s> Tracert results below. </s>

<s> I just realized I posted this in the wrong section I think, sorry about that. </s>
<s> Pretty tired, I just got home from work and am rather new to this board. </s>
<s> If a mod could move it to the appropriate forum I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> Sorry but when I talk to gamers we get them wired, turn off the WiFi and never share the connection. </s>
<s> We may even remove a router. </s>
<s> And in parting with Netflix hitting an all time high in use, lags are hitting new highs too. </s>

<s> In reply to your answer, I did try running a hard wire straight to the modem and got the same result. </s>
<s> My home network is not shared and is secure. </s>
<s> And I still don't understand why my provider routes me from Florida clear to Minnesota at hop 4. </s>
<s> I should mention their home office is like 15 miles from where I live...? </s>
<s> It way out of your control except to talk to the ISP or switch ISPs as routing past that is, again, out of our control except to call in. </s>
<s> I'm hearing this a lot now that Netflix and other video streaming is saturating the pipes. </s>
