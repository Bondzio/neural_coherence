<s> I need to know which processor is better for gaming and overclocking because they are almost the same price and speed. </s>
<s> I also would like to know what the best fan/heat sink under $50.00 for this AM2 setup is. </s>
<s> the 7850 will be a bit faster, but when compared to current core2duo/quad and phenom IIs, it's still a low-end CPU. </s>
<s> the 7000 series is just a dual-core k10 and the phenom (k10) architecture isn't that much faster when compared to the original x2 (k8). </s>
<s> http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=16614&page=7 as for a heatsink/fan, get a boxed cpu and stick with the stock cooler. </s>
<s> if you want to send another $40 or $50, don't waste it on a cooler... get a faster CPU like a phenom ii x3 710. </s>
