<s> I have three printers and not a one works properly. </s>
<s> One is an HP Photosmart C4480 (all-in-one) which prints for my Mac OS X, 10.6.3. </s>
<s> It was working OK for a while and now it only prints blacke. </s>
<s> Even pictures come out black. </s>
<s> I have bought new cartridges and downloaded the latest software. </s>
<s> The next PC. </s>
<s> is a Dell Dimension 2400 using WINXP I pretty much rebuilt after hurricane Charlie got through with it. </s>
<s> Anyway, I have a Kodak, Easyshare (all in-one) printer with that and it won't do anything with black. </s>
<s> It will print in colour but looks very much like a negative. </s>
<s> New cartridges installed and the latest software downloaded. </s>
<s> I bought a used printer to help me get by while I tried to solve my problems. </s>
<s> It's an H.P deskjet 5650. </s>
<s> I invested in two new cartridges and plugged it into my IBM Laptop Thinkpad. </s>
<s> Strange thing is, it will print a beautiful HP in blue at thebottom of the page and hp deskjet 5600 , www.hp.com at the top. </s>
<s> I should mention that a while ago I had them all wirelessed and could print on one printer from all three. </s>
<s> Trouble stared when we bought the Mac which I hate! </s>
<s> I'm quite good with windows although both of my othe PC's are running WinXP&gt; Apart from being frustrating, it's getting expensive and my computer illiterate husband is sure that I am the problem. </s>
<s> If have always thought that most of you moderators are geniuses and hope someone can advise me. </s>
<s> Thanks, hopefully, Val Fasig </s>
<s> It has no color. </s>
<s> Just a few minutes to install and do the alignment. </s>
<s> And now it prints color again. </s>
<s> This model sure eats ink. </s>
<s> But your issue sounds like something else. </s>
<s> I don't see what it is unless someone has been tinkering with printer settings. </s>
<s> Sorry I think we need Karnac. </s>

<s> Assuming that you uninstalled and re installed the software(s) and still have/had the same issues? </s>
<s> Of course the Mac is going to USE different software (usually a separate CD). </s>
<s> Also, what are the operating systems on the PC'S? </s>
<s> Two have windows XP and one has the Mac Safari. </s>
<s> I did download the the latest software for the Mac version. </s>
<s> Still not having luck. </s>
<s> I can print letters and other data on the H.P C4480 but pictures ae still printing black! </s>
<s> Thank you for your suggestions. </s>
<s> The HPP 4480 is fixed. </s>
<s> I, again, uninstalled and reinstalled the software and that did it. </s>
<s> It won't, however, do it for my other two. </s>
<s> I'll keep trying. </s>
<s> My husband's accusing me of being obsessed. </s>
<s> Well, at least the one he uses is better! </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> Valerie </s>
