1.1.1	Here 's the situation : One plugs in a USB key into a slot that 's on the side of the computer .	St
1.1.2	The slot is badly designed and does not allow the key to go all the way through .	St
1.1.3	The user mistakenly believes that the computer does not recognize the key and turns off the computer , the key still half plugged-in .	St
1.1.4	The computer never turns on again and the hard disk 's memory is gone .	St
1.1.5	Can it be that this is due to the USB key ?	Ques
1.2.1	The USB design is such that you can short out all 4 pins and it will not fry the PC .	St
1.2.2	However there are always exceptions such as a board that ignored the USB design guide or those USB memory keys that contained a virus/trojan .	St
1.2.3	For some owners that USB virus/trojan does destroy the computer since the costs of reloading the OS exceed the price of a new PC ( for some out there . )	St

1.3.1	Anything is possible , however its stretching abit for the USB port to crash or even fry the system .	St
1.3.2	One thing can lead to another and if all the ducks line-up the USB port could cause the PSU to lose that power leg and thus bring the system down , however that suggests the true use of the port was n't proper or manufacturing boo-boo was done .	St
1.3.3	The USB port is the low-voltage and ampage variety .	St
1.3.4	If the system as you reported it has happened , then only physical exam and testing must be done to find the true cause .	St
1.3.5	Maybe a faulty USB was the tipping point and it went downhill from there , IMHO .	St
