i can't remember the model # but it was called the compac presario ultimate multimedia machine.
i had very limited computing experience through my job but i didn't know much at all.
this was in feb 1997. the computer had 24 megs ram and a 2 gig hd.
it wasn't the fastest even then.
but then, i didn't really know enough to need anything faster.
