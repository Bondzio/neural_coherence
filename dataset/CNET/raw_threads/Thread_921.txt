So I went into device manager/ hard drive/ properties, etc., and there is no listing or option of anything re: DMA mode. does this mean it's automatically enabled and I don't need to worry about it? I did not install any outside software or drivers on the hard drive. THANKS fj

Next, look in the drive item for DMA as well as the IDE controller itself. Remember that if you load ANY real mode CDROM driver, you have to disable that (it's in config.sys) first. Bob
