1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? q=Error+691	Ques
1.3.1	Anytime you have an & quot ; error message & quot ; copy & paste or write down then enter in your search engine in order to hints & tips on what 's up .	St
1.3.2	I suspect , that upon your system boot-up it automatically tries to log-on onto the www or network .	St
1.3.3	It gets a hit ( OK ) or miss ( failed ) try and thus the error , especially if it tries to re-enter right were you left out during the freeze .	St
1.3.4	See , if you can edit you boot-up or start-up process NOT to automatically enter into the network , do this manually or from the icon required .	St
1.3.5	The system has so much to do during start-up anything can go wrong and having the network link is just another item to start .	St
1.3.6	I do suspect as well , you can & quot ; activate & quot ; the network s/w from hi-speed and forgo the actual link-up and do that part manually as stated above .	St
