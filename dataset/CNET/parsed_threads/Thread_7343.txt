<s> I've been a console gamer for about 12 years, and this summer I've decided to build a gaming rig to suit my computer and gaming needs. </s>
<s> As far as accessories, I was just wondering if getting a programmable gaming controller would be better for shooting games or just using an affordable gaming mouse and keyboard (Saitek Cyborg & RAT 7 for example)? </s>
<s> I used to pc game and I found almost every year I had to shell out another $200 + to keep the video card performance up. </s>
<s> On top of that I like to play fair for fun and it just ruins the fun when anyone ( with lil effort ) can either but parts that give advantages to them and/or modify pc files to flat out cheat ! </s>
<s> Another thing I hate about pc gaming is when i want to play and instead of playing im remote connecting to other players to get their divers working or the headsets going , network issues blah blah etc with computers and so many unique configs i was getting tired of it and i just wanted to play Alas, along came the ps3 with hd graphics, so simple, put the disk in and turn on your headset on and away you gooooo. </s>
<s> the graphics before were way better on the computer but now that's evened out quite a bit and with $$ I save I can buy a ps3 every year. </s>
<s> Ps we have the xbox also and they can be modified to cheat too, but the ps3 is still better locked up ! </s>
<s> Sorry for the rant but I'll never go back to pc gaming bc it's too open , not as many players and too much money and configuration. </s>
