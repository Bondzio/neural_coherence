1.1.1	First, I hope that I am posting this in the right area.	St
1.1.2	I &quot;work&quot; for a non-profit therapeutic riding program and we have begun to grow and now need a database to keep up with our horses and kids.	St
1.1.3	I found one that I think will fit our needs EquineMax (I believe it is Access-based), the only problem is that it is not web-based.	St
1.1.4	We all use our laptops and do a lot of work out of our homes.	St
1.1.5	There are about 4 of us that need to access a database and input/delete data from different locations.	St
1.1.6	We work in a remote area that has basically no internet access other than air-cards that we bring.	St
1.1.7	I originally thought that online storage would be a good solution but several people have told me that you cannot &quot;host&quot; a database program on those.	St
1.1.8	I thought about building a simple network but have not done that in 10 years--but I am willing to learn.	St
1.1.9	I agreed to take over this project since I am the most computer savvy--which is not saying much.	St
1.1.10	I have talked to several computer friends but none seem to have a good idea on where to start.	St
1.1.11	We do not have a budget to allow us to hire a company to work it out for us--so any help or direction you could point me in would be VERY appreciated!!	St
1.1.12	!	St
1.2.1	I looked around and http://www.horselogs.com/FAQ.asp looks basic and the single digit dollars may help.	St
