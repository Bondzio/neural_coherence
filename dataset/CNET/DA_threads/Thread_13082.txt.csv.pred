1.1.1	Dell Dimension 2400 ( XP ) Host Dell Inspiron 1521 ( Vista ) Zyxel P-300W router I set this network up last month with the Zyxel CD , and out of the box , the network worked fine .	St
1.1.2	However , I 've managed to somehow mess up the system so that now it will not share printer or files - no problem with web connection .	St
1.1.3	Much of my confusion centers on terminology , namely the difference between & quot ; network name & quot ; , & quot ; ssid name & quot ; , & quot ; local area connection & quot ; , and & quot ; router name & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Currently , it looks like the same name is being applied to each depending on where you 're looking - is this problematic ?	Ques
1.1.5	Frankly , I 'm not sure where one sets or changes these names , especially with the two different OS .	St
1.1.6	If I look at & quot ; My Network Places & quot ; on the host Dell D-2400 , all I see is the router and something named , & quot ; My Web Sites on MSN ?	Ques
1.1.7	( ? ? ? )	Ques
1.1.8	- No mention of any computers or printer .	St
1.1.9	And if I look at & quot ; Network and Sharing & quot ; on the laptop , the map of my network shows both computers and the router , but no printer .	St
1.1.10	I 've done and redone network and wireless setups on both computers multiple times ( this may be compounding the problem !	St
1.1.11	) , and always must try to make manual settings , since my & quot ; host & quot ; computer will only allow me to make a network system disk on a floopy , and the laptop has no floopy drive .	St
1.1.12	And when I try to use the XP Install disk , it simply deposits some files on the laptop , and thats it !	St
1.1.13	So I try to do manual setups , but something 's not right .	St
1.1.14	I suspect that I 've simply changed a setting somewhere , but after 3 days of changing and re-changing everything , I 'm at my wits end .	St
1.1.15	I 've spent a good deal of time looking at the archives here , but am not finding anything that helps .	St
1.1.16	Thanks for any advice or suggestion on how to resolve this .	Ques
1.1.17	john	St
1.2.1	For the most part , if both computers are able to access the internet , then you can pretty much forget about the router and wireless settings having anything to do with your problems .	St
1.2.2	If you were able to see each computer , share files and printers when you first set up the network , then the most likely cause or your initial problems ( at that time ) would probably be related to an issue with your Internet Security software .	St
1.2.3	Norton , McAfee or other firewall software are famous for blocking the network interaction between computers .	St
1.2.4	Try disabling all Firewall software on both computers .	St
1.2.5	If that works , then you will have to go into and change the settings in each firewall until you find the problem .	St
1.2.6	Unfortunately , since you have been playing with the system you may have created a whole new set of problems .	St
1.2.7	So , in general you need to check all of the following to allow the computers to talk to each other on the network .	Sug
1.2.8	1 .	St
1.2.9	Each computer must have a uniquely DIFFERENT computer name .	St
1.2.10	2 .	St
1.2.11	Each computer must be assigned to the SAME Workgroup name .	St
1.2.12	3 .	St
1.2.13	Firewall software must be configured correctly .	St
1.2.14	4 .	St
1.2.15	File and Print Sharing must be turned on in the Windows Firewall , if using it .	St
1.2.16	5 .	St
1.2.17	A file , folder and printer must be actually shared ( as indicated by a hand under the file or printer name ) .	St
1.2.18	Dana Wayland Computer	St
1.3.1	Appreciate your response - spent the morning trying your suggestions - here 's my results : * Computers have unique names - ca n't see any conflicts .	St
1.3.2	* Firewalls settings look OK on both ( BTW , the laptop has a McAfee and a Window 's FW - should I disable one ? )	Ques
1.3.3	* I think there 's a problem with the way the laptop ( Vista ) is handling the workgroup - in Control Panel/Network , it shows the correctly named workgroup ( with only the two correctly named computers and no other devices ) , and another workgroup named & quot ; unspecified & quot ; that shows an & quot ; internet gateway device & quot ; , and the logos of & quot ; Media Player & quot ; for two of the users on the laptop .	St
1.3.4	I do n't know how to merge the two workgroups or delete one .	St
1.3.5	Although I 've tried to add my printer ( Canon S750 ) to my correct workgroup , it wo n't show here .	St
1.3.6	And when I try to add a & quot ; wireless device & quot ; , Vista says it ca n't find any .	St
1.3.7	Under CP/Network and Sharing , it correctly shows the laptop , the correctly named network ( private ) , and the internet .	St
1.3.8	On Network Map , it shows , correct network name , both computers , switch , and internet .	St
1.3.9	No printer here either .	St
1.3.10	I 'm also noticing something strange in the laptop 's Control Panel/Network Connections - it shows two connections : a Local Area Connection ( using Broadcom Integrated Controller ) that is X'ed out , and a Wireless Network Connection ( using a Dell Wireless WLAN minicard ) that is active .	St
1.3.11	I have n't touched these as yet .	St
1.3.12	That 's enough for now - I suspect you 'll find some issues in all that , at least I hope you do .	St
1.3.13	Thanks , Dana , for helping with this .	St

1.4.1	post 10 http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2584349 Please remember to install the drivers for the printer in your laptop Rick	St
1.5.1	Yes , I saw your tip , and I went to Canon 's site and looked for an updated driver for Vista .	St
1.5.2	However , only the XP driver was available .	St
1.5.3	So I dl'ed that one and installed on Vista laptop .	St
1.5.4	Do you think that 'll cause problems ?	Ques
1.5.5	john	St
1.6.1	with printer sharing .	St
1.6.2	There was a whole post on this .	St
1.6.3	Your answer lies in this post .	St
1.6.4	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=232132 & messageID=2395292 # 2395292 Udating the drivers for the printer does help , but if you look at how kaufmanmoore gave the instructions on how he solved this problem and everyone else responded to him about how it worked , you 'll understand what I 'm trying to tell you .	St
1.6.5	Read the post entirely and I think you 'll have a better understanding on what is going on .	St
1.6.6	Rick	St
1.7.1	Even though McAfee firewall my look fine , you should still disable it just to make sure .	St
1.7.2	You never want 2 firewalls or 2 antivirus programs running at the same time so disable 1 firewall .	St
1.7.3	Please Review this document on Print and files sharing with Vista .	St
1.7.4	http : //technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx Network Connections should show 2 types of connections .	St
1.7.5	One is your wireless and the other Local Connection is for a hard wired ethernet connection .	St
1.7.6	The hardware local connection should show that it is disconnected at this point unless you plug your laptop directly into your network .	St
1.7.7	Some people may even disable the local connection if they want .	St
1.8.1	I read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore - at first I could n't get the host desktop to create a new local port , but then , being a basically paranoid guy , I uninstalled both instances of Network Magic ( came with the Zyxel router ) from each machine , and backed up each to a date prior to NM 's initial install .	St
1.8.2	Worked like a charm !	St
1.8.3	Now I 'd hate to be left thinking that the folks at Network Magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution , but , ...	St
1.8.4	I do anyway .	St
1.8.5	Only problem left is I 'm still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating - However , I did dl the new needed driver , but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop , I had to manually install the driver , and it installed into the same folder in dl'ed into .	St
1.8.6	I suspect that 's incorrect .	St
1.8.7	Any final suggestion on how I can get it into a better location ?	Ques
1.8.8	Thanks Rick - I appreciate your invaluable assistance .	Polite
1.8.9	john	St
1.9.1	this is really a Vista glitch .	St
1.9.2	Most drivers are in the system32 folder .	St
1.9.3	c : //windows/system32 Printer drivers need to be installed in each computer .	St
1.9.4	My home printer setup is Dell wireless printer adapter 3300 plugged into my Dell Photo AIO Printer 964 .	St
1.9.5	I installed the printer drivers in all three laptops ( Windows XP ) .	St
1.9.6	I do NOT have to leave a host computer on to print .	St
1.9.7	Daughter can print from her room , son can also , aand I can print from the back patio , when it 's nice out .	St
1.9.8	We use a Netgear router that has the firmware updated Broadcast SSID Use WPA security ( WEP can be hacked ) Use nothing else .	St
1.9.9	Never loose a connection and we can always print , scan , copy or fax when we want to .	St
1.9.10	Rick	St
1.10.1	All is well - I can print from the laptop , and share files from the host computer as well .	St
1.10.2	But there are two remaining nags , both of which are not killers , but I 'd like to solve them anyway .	St
1.10.3	Each time I print from the laptop , I get a popup message that says there is something wrong with the print monitor , and it suggests that printer drivers be installed at all locations in the network ( just as you said ) .	St
1.10.4	But I have done that , as best as I know how - I dl'ed the only available drivers from the Canon site ( a Win XP driver , and a Vista patch ) , manually installed them ( god only knows where they installed - no indication of where during the process ) and it ends by telling me that they were successfully installed .	St
1.10.5	But , ...	St
1.10.6	? ? ? ?	Ques
1.10.7	However , as I 'm getting that pop-up message , the printing process is going on sucessfully !	St
1.10.8	The other nag is that if I go into & quot ; Network and Sharing Center & quot ; on the laptop ( Vista ) , under & quot ; Sharing and Discovery & quot ; , it says , & quot ; There are no printers attached to this computer & quot ; .	St
1.10.9	Is that OK ?	Ques
1.10.10	Seems to me it should be telling me if there is a printer attached to this network , right ?	Ques
1.10.11	And there is a printer on the network .	St
1.10.12	But , as I said , I can live with both of these , but of course , I 'd like them both to be correct .	St
1.10.13	Thanks again , Rick , for all your help .	St
1.10.14	john	St
1.11.1	I ca n't answer your question .	St
1.11.2	I do n't have Vista so you may be able to find the answer wating for someone to post or you may want to post the question in the Windows Vista forum .	St
1.11.3	If you have to , post the url for this post and maybe this will also help someone steer you in the right direction .	St
1.11.4	Rick	St
1.12.1	You 've already helped quite a bit .	St
1.12.2	I 'll take your advice again and begin hanging out on the Vista forum - Lord knows , there 's a lot to learn !	St
1.12.3	Thanks again , Rick	St
