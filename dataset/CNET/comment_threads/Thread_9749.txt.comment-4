Analog capture is full of bad things waiting for us to discuss.
I can't tell from your first post how bad it was.
Maybe you can put in the full details and a youtube of the results?
Some folk are easily upset at discussion forums so if that's you, we might not get along.
I have analog capture experience to before the Amiga days, even on the IBM 8088 days so I'm ready when you tell more.
In the meantime if you want to know what I use for the capture step it's a DVD RECORDER.
That's my secret.
