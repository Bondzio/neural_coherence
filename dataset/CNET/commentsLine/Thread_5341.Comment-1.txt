i bought myself a 1 gb stick of ram for an old tower i had been using, but it has since died (i'm hoping the ram stick didn't have anything to do with it...).
i believe the ram is ddr 1. so i'm wondering, if i go and buy myself a new 3 gb equipped computer that uses ddr3 and i put the old stick in one of it's spare slots... will that helpmate computer in any way?
or would it just hinder it?
