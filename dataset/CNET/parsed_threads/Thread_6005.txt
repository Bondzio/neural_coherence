<s> I about fell off my chair when I came across this review this morning: http://tinyurl.com/mvn5e We ordered a pc from Alienware amost 8 weeks ago. </s>
<s> It was supposed to arrive 8/28. </s>
<s> We finally got fed up and cancelled the order yesterday, 10/6. </s>
<s> The number of excuses Alieware can come up with as to why they haven't built and shipped your pc is mind boggling. </s>
<s> I can only hope we don't have to contact the Florida State Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commision to get the $3400 charge removed from our credit card. </s>
<s> CNET, STOP STOP STOP STOP promoting Alienware!!! </s>
<s> They are turning your store ratings into a joke. </s>
<s> 4 stars for Alienware, gimme a break. </s>
<s> http://tinyurl.com/jrndd </s>
<s> You might even find Micahel Dell's information and e-mail him directly... </s>
<s> The acquisition was announced in March, to be complete after regulatory approval; there's no PR at the Alienware site to say the deal has been sommuated, however, so it may still be in process. </s>
<s> -- Dave K. </s>
<s> I knew that Dell bought Alienware. </s>
<s> My problem is with Cnet continuing to give Alienware a 4 star rating. </s>
<s> You don't show reviews that people post for STORES, only PRODUCTS. </s>
<s> You check any other reseller rating site and you will find dozens of bad reviews for this company yet CNET continues to give them 4 starts. </s>
<s> Here on CNET you don't see what an awful time people are having with this company unless you read the reviews for Alienware products. </s>
<s> It's turning your own store ratings into a joke. </s>
<s> Look at: http://tinyurl.com/n4dnx http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1650.html yet here they are on Cnet with 4 out of 5 stars. </s>
<s> I was in exactly the same boat, but I decided not to allow Alienware to drag me along that long. </s>
<s> When they started giving me delivery dates that were a month longer than they said when I placed the purchase, I immediately cancelled and built the system myself. </s>
<s> My dollars speak for themselves, I build the same system for about $1500 less and used the difference to buy a nice Dell for my niece. </s>
<s> I'll never buy again now that I've built a system on my own. </s>
<s> cookiebun, I am sorry to hear about the trouble you have had with your order. </s>
<s> Just out of curiosity, which system did you order? </s>
<s> Was it the same one from the review? </s>
<s> What was the reason they gave you for taking so long to ship? </s>
<s> I built the pc I'm using now. </s>
<s> We cancelled our order with Alienware and decided to build my husband's new gaming rig ourselves. </s>
<s> We spent about $3000 at newegg.com. </s>
<s> Most of the stuff will be here Thursday. </s>
<s> If all goes well he'll be gaming again by Sat. </s>
<s> I think I'll build all my own P.C.s in the future. </s>
<s> This was total B.S. </s>
<s> It was a core 2 duo Area 51 system. </s>
<s> Since placing the order in August they managed to be out of: The case The motherboard. </s>
<s> The dvd Drive. </s>
<s> The power supply. </s>
<s> Machine sat at stage 5 for 3 weeks until I filed a complaint with the Floridia BBB. </s>
<s> Jumped to stage 8 and sat there for 4 days. </s>
<s> Called Alienware, they said stage 8 usually takes 24 hours unless there is a problem. </s>
<s> Obviously there was a problem so we decided to cancel. </s>
<s> See my review (and others) here: http://www.resellerratings.com/seller_info.pl?seller_id=1650 Glad I'm not the guy who waited for them the actually ship. </s>
<s> He's had 2 mobos and the machine still doesn't work. </s>
<s> i configured my area 51 7500 9/4/06 3 weeks later i reconfigured it as of 10/12/06 they tell me i,ll be at stage 5 by 9/16/06 other than the check status site still showing my old price and sitting on stage 3 forever i haven,t had to many problems with them i.m exited about my new system but getting nervous reading this negative stuff </s>
<s> i meant 10/16/06 </s>
<s> i went to check on the status of my pc today but decided to check my email first and there it was to my suprise a tracking # from fedex my pc is on its way i hope everything is ok updates to follow </s>
<s> let us know if it boots up ok. We finished builing my husband's pc this past weekend. </s>
<s> Still haven't got our refund from Alienware. </s>
