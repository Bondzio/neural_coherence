<s> I am building a new system. </s>
<s> My question is can i copy EVERYTHING from my old harddrive to a newone. </s>
<s> I want to do this so i wouldnt have to buy a full version of xp. </s>
<s> Will this work? </s>
<s> Will my old computer be left unharmed? </s>
<s> your new pc will have different hardware and need different low-level drivers, so windows probably won't even start. </s>
<s> even if it does, the os will detect that your hardware has changed and require re-activation. </s>
<s> The XP license is only good for one computer. </s>
<s> A full REATIL XP license allows you to install XP on a different computer, but it must be removed from the old one. </s>
<s> ASIDE: Copying files or a disk image from an old computer doesn't damage the old computer. </s>
