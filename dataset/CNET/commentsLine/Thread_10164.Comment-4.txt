automatically.
just set the mobo up with cpu with hsf, memory, video, and monitor.
front panel connections, nothing else.
turn power on and get the first video screen.
get that, shutdown and hook up a keyboard and turn on again and go into bios, it will show the cpu frequency et al.
don't bother installing anything else until you get this far.
if the speeds are incoreect, the mobo should default to the lowest to protect the cpu.
the voltage sttings are probably for overclockers use.
doesn't the mob manual show a default setting for the voltage???
with that the mobo sets it automatically for the cpu.
