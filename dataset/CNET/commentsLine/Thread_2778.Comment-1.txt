i need to take a hdd out of a hp pavilion machine to use in another machine?
i opened the side panel & unscrewed the screw.
on the other side i can't access the screw coz there's this metal plate that covers the entire side.
the motherboard and everthing is attached to it.
how do i get the hdd out of that machine?
