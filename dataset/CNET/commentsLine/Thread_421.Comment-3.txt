thanks for the suggestion, but i already tried the calibration.
when i go to the &quot;hp battery optimizer&quot; in the &quot;power options&quot; menu, i get an initial message that &quot;the selected battery is not supported or is not working properly&quot;.
if i click &quot;ok&quot; and then click on &quot;battery details&quot;, the resulting table says that the &quot;static data&quot; are &quot;not available&quot;, the &quot;historic data&quot; are &quot;cycle count=9; max error=100;full charge capacity=4000 mah&quot; and the &quot;dynamic data&quot; are &quot;current = 0 ma; voltage = 11264 mv; remaining capacity = 250 mah&quot;.
it won't let me test or calibrate the battery, i presume since it's &quot;not supported&quot;.
since the system is apparently reading a voltage on the battery, i took the battery out of the computer and checked with a small-probe dvom.
sure enough, there is about 11.4 v between what i assume is the ground pin (separated on the right from the others) and the fourth pin to the left of the separation (logically, these might be pins 1 and 5??).
i guess i'll now try to find if i can draw some current from the battery through a suitable resistor.
the strange thing is that the computer has not worked using this remaining battery for several months, so i had just assumed that the battery is bad - as indicated by the red light on the charging circuit.
maybe it is just a bad battery/charger connector - either on the computer or on the battery, or maybe just the connection between them, though i cleaned them pretty carefully, which usually would solve such a problem at least enough to give some intermittent indication of an improvement - and that hasn't happened.
sure would help to have a schematic of the charging/monitoring circuit including a pinout of the connector!
thanks again for the help!
still seeking!
aloha!
