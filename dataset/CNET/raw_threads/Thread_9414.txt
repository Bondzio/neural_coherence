In the display settings, the max 16:10 widescreen resolution is 1680x1050, with 1440x900 being the next step down. When I set the resolution to 1440x900, the display fits on the entire screen and is not distorted, but I want better resolution. When I switch to 1680x1050, the display fits vertically, but I lose some off the right edge of the monitor (the clock plus 1 tray icon). When I move the cursor over there, it slides into view, but pushes the left side of the display off the screen (so I can't see the &quot;start&quot; button). I've messed with the display settings in both the Windows interface and the NVIDIA controls, but I can't get it to fit. Why would two resolutions with the same aspect ratio (16:10) produce different results? Is there anything I haven't tried to adjust it?

I'm using a Dell Vostro 1500 laptop running XP Pro with a NVIDiA GeForce 8600M GT graphics card. Trying to use the Acer V223w monitor for a dual display setup. Any ideas on what I can try? I've tweaked every setting I can find, using the monitor's button controls, Windows settings, and the included software, and nothing fixes the issue. Any help would be *greatly* appreciated!

Since the laptop's running at 1680x1050, which is the native resolution of the auxiliary monitor, there shouldn't be a conflict, right? And the issue persists whether I am extending the desktop or using only the auxiliary monitor: The full frame of the screen is still partially lost.

Premise1: Your laptop has a WSXGA+ (1680x1050) native display. Not just Windows setting at 1680x1050 but the panel itself has that native res. Premise2: &quot;using only the auxiliary monitor&quot; - means you toggled the display output to only the Acer so that laptop display is extinguished. Not just closing the laptop lid. Premise3: You set the Windows res of laptop at 1680x1050 @ 60 Hz and you set the Windows external res at 1680x1050 @ 60 Hz. Not different refresh rates. Premise4: Acer is hooked up to laptop's VGA port directly. Not thru some KVM. And you still have the problem?

Premise 2: Also correct - the laptop is set to display *only* on the Acer - totally blank screen on the laptop's display. Premise 3: Also correct - Windows res is set to 1680x1050 @60 Hz, external display res also set to those numbers. Premise 4: Correct. Acer is hooked up directly to laptop's VGA port. No intermediary devices. And yes, I'm still losing about 1/8 of the screen (i.e. what should be displayed) on the Acer. Other steps I have taken: 1) Used the Acer's &quot;auto&quot; function to sync with laptop. Result: Still missing 1/8 of the screen. 2) Installed and updated monitor management software (Acer Desktop Management) that came with the Acer. I did not do this initially because I wanted to the use the monitor as a simple plug-n-play. Result: Still missing 1/8 of the screen. 3) Manually adjusted the horizontal position of the screen so that it is as far to the right on the display as possible. Result: gains a small portion of the &quot;missing&quot; part of the screen, but still missing a significant part. Hope this gives you a better idea of what's going on. I'll post a photo, if that would help...

One has to assume these stds exist in all modern monitors, but you should verify with Acer. Ensure nVidia (Dell) drivers are up-to-date. Lastly, take your laptop to a store and hook up to other monitors of same res.

Apparently systems with some ATI cards have the same problem that I had. I just returned the Acer and tested, then purchased, a Viewsonic instead. Thanks for your input, Samkh.
