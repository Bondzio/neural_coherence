in regards to the vcaccess manager, i did have that installed at one time but i deinstalled the application.
verizon tech support messed me up on that initially - when i first called them (i stopped after my 5th call) they had me download that.
that software actually is meant to enable you to use your cell phone as an access point for the internet for your pc.
not at all what i wanted.
my fear is even though i have deleted the app, it still recognizes the device as a modem i have tried the auto sync and also going to music, then sync.
it really is an issue with the driver i think.
when i am in the device manager and then hit sync on the phone you can see the list of devices refresh itself, and i get the yellow ?
mark next to the device if i click on that fast enough, i get the window about the device, and it says it has no driver.
i think the issue is when it tries to go into sync mode after reading tons of posts from the link robert gave me above i really think i need to load or point it to the wpdusb.sys driver but for the life of me i have no idea how to do that.
if i try to do in manually in the device manager it searches for drivers for the modem and won't do it.
i think i need to make it think it is looking for drivers for a windows portable device
