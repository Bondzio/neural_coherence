1.2.1	Some larger HD 's wo n't work with older computers and operating systems , but there are solutions available .	St
1.2.2	What is the model name of the HD ?	Ques
1.2.3	What is your operating system ( and service pack ) ?	Ques
1.2.4	Click : Start & gt ; Control Panel & gt ; Administrative Tools & gt ; Computer Management Double-Click : Storage & gt ; Disk Management From there you can rt-click any HD and initialize , partition , and format it .	St
1.3.1	Like 'Linkit ' suggested ... get to 'Disk Management ' do a right click on one of the CDs ... .and change the drive letter to say & quot ; R & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Then do the same to the other CD ... make it & quot ; S & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	Shut down the PC and disconnect the new HDD .	St
1.3.4	Then reboot the PC to to see how the drive letters show up ... .you should have a & quot ; C & quot ; , & quot ; D & quot ; plus an & quot ; R & quot ; and & quot ; S & quot ; .	St
1.3.5	If this is the drive line up ... .open explorer and right click on & quot ; C & quot ; on type in a name for & quot ; C & quot ; in the label box .	St
1.3.6	Do the same for & quot ; D & quot ; .	St
1.3.7	Now shut down again and reconnect the new HDD..and see what shows up as other than & quot ; C & quot ; , & quot ; D & quot ; or & quot ; R & quot ; and & quot ; S & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	Then you should be able to identify the new HDD and prepare ( partition and format ) it for use with your system .	St
1.3.9	Keep us posted VAPCMD Note : The reason I suggest changing the CD-ROM drive letters to R and S is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system ... HDD takes precedence over the CDs in drive letter assignments ... leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive ( s ) and the CD-ROM eliminates the CD-ROM drive letters from being bumped/changed in the future .	St
1.4.1	I didnt really understand any of your suggestions-lol-because my real problem is that i put in a new hard drive and can not figure out which one it is , let alone use it !	St
1.4.2	( and yes i have looked all thru disk mang .	St
1.4.3	but dont understand it ) .	St
1.4.4	thanks again , Lizzie	Polite

St
