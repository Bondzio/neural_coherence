1.1.1	what is the smallest posible antenna size for a satellite reciver	St
1.2.1	You wo n't get a good answer since such can vary by what satellite you are receiving from ( power of , what frequency and other factors . )	St
1.2.2	In short , 1/2 the diameter gets you 1/4 the receive sensitivity , so you ca n't arbitrarily change this .	St
1.2.3	You 've been here before and know that you should reveal all about what you are trying to do , otherwise we spiral into some odd ( to you ) response that just gets you upset .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	To recive a signal from an XM radio sattilite & quot ; Rock n Roll & quot ; transmitter	St
1.4.1	Anything else or not following their guidelines and you get to sort out why it did n't work .	St
1.4.2	But you may have not revealed what your true setup is or what you are trying to accomplish .	St
1.4.3	This is typical of your posts .	St
1.4.4	Image if you were not receiving from the satellite , but wanted to use the FM mod 'd XM radio or an external FM transmitter like http : //www.ccrane.com/fm-transmitter.asp In that case , the antenna is n't a satellite antenna , but a stock chunk of wire of the right length .	St

1.5.1	Is there any way in the world with a budjet of a $ 1,000,000 whould there be away to creat a tiny antena to recive the XM satilites signal .	St
1.5.2	When i mean small im talking about it would be able to hock up to an ipod mini small , Thanks Shimi	St
1.6.1	You are dealing with the physics of radio signals .	St
1.6.2	An RF signal at some frequency only is received by a proper sized antenna that has the matching resonant frequency .	St
1.6.3	There are electronics courses on the subject , but in a nutshell , some want no antennas at all .	St
1.6.4	There is a way to move the bigger antenna to another device , then rebroadcast on another freqency that does n't require a big antenna .	St
1.6.5	I supplied just such an solution with that FM transmitter .	St
1.6.6	In closing , I ca n't teach physics or electronic design in this small space .	St
1.6.7	You might have to take some courses .	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
