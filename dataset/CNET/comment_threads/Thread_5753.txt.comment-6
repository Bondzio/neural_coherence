The key method is known to you and the risks.
It matters not in the grand scheme if the whole file or block of access unless that's your &quot;specification&quot; in which case, we need to rewind this to the top and really grind through what products you know about and what I know about.
Then see which fits your spec.
An example USB key product is http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=THESAINT But you don't get two keys and if you buy a second key, it won't let you access the files.
They and others don't offer data recovery services.
You must be aware of the risks.
