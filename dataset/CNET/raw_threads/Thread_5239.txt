I plan on staying with Windows XP Pro. I have a very small business and I use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations.

Copy the drive with something like G4U's COPYDISK (see google for items like this in my post) and then look up XP REPAIR INSTALL to repair the OS. 2. Use AlohaBob.

You could simply pull out the old hard drive and put it in the new machine and boot from that. This will work but it's not a good idea because your installation of XP is set up for your old machine. XP is actually smart enough to cope with this (barely), it's pretty good at installing all the new drivers for your motherboard, etc, but the old drivers and stuff tend to hang around. Basically you'll end up with a wounded operating system and may have more serious problems too. You're really better off rebuilding the whole lot as you'll have a more stable setup in the long run.
