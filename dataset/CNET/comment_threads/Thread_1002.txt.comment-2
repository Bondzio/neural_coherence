Well it looks like your hard drive was malfunctioning doing a good hard wipe and reinstalling the operating system will probably fix it you might want to buy a new hard drive because bad sectors are probably plaguing the drive.
Usually when a hard drive failure occurs a file gets corrupted (usually system files) in your case it was Norton Security it happened to me once but I wasn't able to boot into windows.
In this case it corrupted Norton Security which is most likely tied into Windows hence you were not able to cleanly access Windows.
Well to stop this or at least prevent this from happening in the future get a 350 watt power supply and get a better fan to cool down your hard drive and other components since you are running mid-level components on a weak powersupply which is a major no-no.
Also every once in a while manually run scandisk or the utility inside norton so a hard drive problem can be averted also like changing the oil in your car actually run the utilities that came with norton.
These things usually happen even if you are vigilante but taking these steps may help you avert a crisis from usually happening in the first place.
Defragmenting your hard drive would be a good thing to do as well because all your files will be organized efficiently and major problems like hard drive failure could be averted.
