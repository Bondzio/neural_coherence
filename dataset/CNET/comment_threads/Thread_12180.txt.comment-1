I have a Dell Dimension V350 (win95) that is run occasionally and complained about lost date and time settings - so I replaced the CMOS battery.
Now it won't boot On power up fans and hd starts spinning and display lits up saying: PhoenixBIOS 4.0 Release 6.0 Copyright 1985-1998 Phoenix Technologies Ltd. All Rights Reserved Copyright 1985-1998 Intel Corporation.
4A4RB0X0.10A.0018.P06 Dell Dimension V350 BIOS Version A05 Pentium II processor 350 MHz 64 MB System RAM Press &lt;DEL&gt; to enter SETUP then nothing happens and it doesn't respond to &lt;DEL&gt;.
&lt;Ctrl-Alt-Del&gt; restarts the process but it ends up in the same spot.
If I hit &lt;Del&gt; while it is counting memory up to 64 MB it instead ends up with Entering SETUP ... on the bottom of the screen and nothing happens.
Only response I get is a beep when hitting &lt;any key&gt; after that I have hit it several times before.
I'm a little puzzled over that it only counts up to 64 MB as it is equipped with two memory chips labelled &quot;PC100-322-620&quot; which I belive are of 128 MB each.
Removing one or the other of them stops the counting at 32 MB.
I'd be much obliged for any help on this, CT
