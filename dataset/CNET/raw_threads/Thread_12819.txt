We plan to have wireless as part of it. However, we want a system whereby we can give them accounts with passwords that, when the subscription ends, we can disable. Ive used vpns that had this functionality in a corporation I worked at, but Im at a loss as to what would work best for a small business. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Mark

Most so called security systems that allow dynamic access protect only at a ip level. They really can't prevent sharing of ip's or even everyone sharing a userid/password. A hotel system that intercepts and asks for a password is a example. A VPN you know every machine is who they say they are. These are fairly standard now days and if you use SSL VPN rather than IPSEC you have to set nothing up on the user machine. SSL VPN routers do cost more though. If you want to go the other method you need some system to intercept and another to authenticate the users. Most systems need a radius server but if you already have AD servers it can do radius too and share. The interception part is not as standard as vpn but if you want to do it cheap any old cisco router can do this. It is a feature cisco calls &quot;lock and key&quot; and has been around for many years. It is a little tricky to get setup ... mostly if you want to load dynamic rules from the radius server. In either case since I suspect you are going to run a mix of wired and wireless networks I would setup a outside network that everyone it attached to and place whatever solution you choose between this network and your servers.
