Hi, I'm totally new to wireless networking so please bear with me.
I installed a SMC Barricade wireless router, with an Epson Stylus Photo 870 hooked up using a USB cable plugged directly into the router.
I followed the instruction manual on how to set up a print server, but it keeps on saying on the router setup page that the printer is not ready.
I also installed both the Epson and the SMC Barricade print drivers.
Please help!!
