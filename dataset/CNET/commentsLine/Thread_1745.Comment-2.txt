i use a backup ups so that i can finish what i'm working on (mine lasts for about 45 minutes), save my data, and shut down normally.
however, i don't think it has much impact on the overall life of my computer.
while a 'normal' shutdown is best, any damage that may occur from an instantaneous loss of power would be so slight i doubt it would cause any noticable damage down the road.
(provided such isn't a common occurrance where you live.)
now, a surge protector capable of handling your pc's load is very important, as the ~$50 product will sacrafice itself to save your $500+ computer.
that translates to a very good investment.
just make sure that the one you get has ethernet and/or coaxal protection, as a power surge isn't limited to power cords.
also, make sure that everything connected to your computer physically is also protected by the surge protector, as once again, electricity isn't picky about how it fries your computer as long as it gets the job done.
hope this helps, john
