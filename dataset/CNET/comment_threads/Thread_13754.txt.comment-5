Umm.. just re-read your first answer and I have no clue what is a powerline bridge.
I was thinking you meant relocate the router like for me to use a 100ft Ethernet cord from the modem to the router, placing the router in the middle of the house (which would mean staying downstairs still but just in the middle) to receive better wifi signal around the house.
