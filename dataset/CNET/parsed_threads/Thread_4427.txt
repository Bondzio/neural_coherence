<s> My 533mhz P3 (windows 98) has been freezing up intermittently ever since I had the processor cooling fans replaced (old ones were making noise). </s>
<s> I have taken it back to the shop twice, and they cannot duplicate the problem. </s>
<s> It works fine for them, and they say the processor is NOT overheating. </s>
<s> But when I get it back home, it locks up. </s>
<s> I've tried plugging it into a different electrical outlet, to no avail. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> They could be right. </s>
<s> Many shops are cooler than where the machine is at home. </s>
<s> Try this: 1. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Point a fan at the innards. </s>
<s> Any difference? </s>

<s> No difference, I'm afraid. </s>
<s> Beginning to suspect shop incompetence/deception. </s>
<s> Unless it has to do with electrical service? </s>
<s> Or my peripherals? </s>
<s> &quot;Or my peripherals?&quot; &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; This tip is put up with every post. </s>
<s> While it may or may not help, I wish you the best in finding the cause and a cure, but let's just state that old machines can go unstable even with the best of care. </s>
<s> A prime example is this GOOGLE -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?&q=BAD+MOTHERBOARD+CAPACITORS Also worth noting are the PESTS that we find on too many machines. </s>
<s> I wrote up a short list about this at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 Not many shops will alert people to this issue because it would run up a bill and inflict too much time educating the users. </s>
<s> (NO OFFENSE INTENDED HERE!) </s>
<s> Now that we've got a good idea it's not heat related, we move to &quot;other items.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I have exactly the same problem with 3 pcs. </s>
<s> 2 of them are brand new celeron-D machines. </s>
<s> They work in my shop but not at my customers site. </s>
<s> I have tried putting in a new power circuit and using surge protectors. </s>
<s> The cpu and power fans work perfectly. </s>
<s> I get lockups while in the bios or when windows starts or has been running for 20-30 min. </s>
<s> I think it may be related to the wireless G communications card (Dlink). </s>
<s> It works on some networks but not on others. </s>
<s> Do you have a wireless card in the pc? </s>
