<s> i got an idea for a budget system... if u get the 300mb or 640 mb and OC will it be as fast as the gtx? </s>
<s> OCing my 7900gtx improoved the performance ALOT </s>
<s> the lower end had a 500mhz core, 1400mhz mem clock and didnt metion shader clock the high end had 575 mhz core, 1800mhz mem, and 1350 mhz shader clock if they both have a shader clock i believe u could buy an 8800 gts instead of gtx and OC and get the same results.i really dont think that 200 some odd mb memory is gonna make a diffirence. </s>
<s> No, not really, this is cuz some hardware specs cannot be changed e.g uni. </s>
<s> shader, gtx has128, gts has 96. that aint really poss. </s>
<s> to OC, although you do realize there is a limit how far you can actuallt OC. </s>
<s> You will get improved performance but i REALLLy dont thing youll match the GTX by just OCing! </s>
<s> ! </s>
