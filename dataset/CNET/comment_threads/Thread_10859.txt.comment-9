No, with WEP security there's little chance your neighbour will be tapping into your internet.
You don't need (or want) to start changing the wiring.
As you don't currently need wireless the only thing you need to do to reduce any risk is to have a look at the manual for the router (download a copy from the maker's site) and address the router's user interface via the browser in your desktop machine and in the router settings turn off wireless.
You might as well familiarise yourself with these procedures as, when you get the new laptop, you'll probably have to mess around in the router's settings to get it to work with the laptop's wireless.
