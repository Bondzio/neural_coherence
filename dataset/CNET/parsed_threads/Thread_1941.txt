<s> I currently have a linksys wireless b router (BEFW11S4) and I find that it's is becoming a bit slow, especially for file sharing. </s>
<s> I have found a good deal on a linksys Wireless N router (WRT300N) router ( 50$ off, new). </s>
<s> At home I currently have 2 laptops (macbook,acer) running on wifi, one desktop pc that is wired, and my ps3 that is also running on wifi. </s>
<s> I just looking for someones extra opinion and if the router is good for me. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Yep. </s>
<s> The difference between 11 Mb/s and around a hundred (depending on who you talk to). </s>
<s> If you upgrade, go for it, that price is good. </s>
<s> But the caveat here is that (and all) advertised speed is in perfect laboratory conditions. </s>
<s> Expect around 20-30 Mb/s actual. </s>
<s> If you want to really smoke, get a Gigabit router. </s>
<s> I have a D-link DIR-655 Gigabit/wireless N router. </s>
<s> Wired speeds are a sight to behold. </s>
<s> You can add a Gigabit PCI card to a desktop and PCMCIA card for laptops. </s>
<s> My server has built in 10/100 but I added a Gb PCI card. </s>
<s> I then added a PCMCIA card to my IBM (has wireless G) laptop. </s>
