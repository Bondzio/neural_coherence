ok, fixing this in windows appears to be not possible since the instructions and cd are lost.
you owned this so i won't write further about this or anything more about windows.
-&gt;  ok, that's good news.
this scanner appears to have linux sane support.
that means you can create a dual boot xp and linux os setup and get sane to drive the scanner in linux then put the scans in some common folder so when you boot xp, you can use the scans.
