I don't know if this is an option to you, but I plan to buy a 200 Gb high RPM internal HD, place it in an enclosure, and use the USB 2.0 connection from the enclosure as the connector.
You'll save a bundle (assuming you're not looking for a highly mobile HD; this is more of a 'stays in the house' external HD, I think)
