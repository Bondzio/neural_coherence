No video output just the beeps - I hope its not the graphics card!
I would test out the memory but how can I if it wont POST ?
I've checked Foxconn's website for info on RAM compatibility but to no avail however someone in another forum found some and I'm waiting for him to tell me where it is!
Have you any sources?
