i can't say i understand exactly how to test dns but here is something i just tried.
i am currently working with a plug in card, all items are accessed.
ran ipconfig and noted all the settings.
removed the card and reenabled the internal nic, again run ipconfig, all the information is the same except for mac address and ip address.
but still can not access internet.
