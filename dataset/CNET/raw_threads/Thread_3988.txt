For instance, I have a P4 3.0ghz with ATI RADEON x600 and I get around 28-30 fps on half life 2, it's played around medium. There is no lag, but the graphics look awesome anyhow. Once I get around 25 fps, its starts to lag. I've never seen a game on HDTV with a high end machine, so I'm wondering, is the difference really noticeable?

When you play a section of the game where the fps drops and you feel the computer is lagging, does the lag happen if you replay that section? If it does then it is a section in the game that your computer is having a hard time keeping up. The fix would be to upgrade the computer, maybe more RAM, better video card, and faster HDD. If it does not follow this pattern then you may have a background task happening durring the game play that is slowing your computer down. Investigate what is running in the back ground such as a anti-virus program, an auto update for some program and maybe even a virus or adware program is messing around. See what you can turn off. I believe that Half Life 2 has a FAQ you can check with that can advise you on this subject. I have read reviews of video cards that run at 70 fps so yes 28-30 maybe slow but I have played on some older system with frame rates as low as 18 and still had fun. Short answer is YES it is noticeable.

I just started learning how to build a computer and later on I'm hoping to spend around 3 grand to build one, but I researched around and the highest gaming machine will cost around 6-7 grand, which is why I think the XPS 710 H2C is a good deal since they overclock it and what not.

I tend to wait till I find a game that offers something new that makes me gotta have it. Then I look into what I need to run the new game flat out. Usually, I find that I can run it on a computer I have and then I play the game and see if the sparks dont fade. If I still gotta have it than I build. I bought 1 computer with the idea of it being very hot. I had it custom built to order. In 6 months it was old hat because the industry jumped to new slot design for the video slot (PCI was dumped for AGP). Right now Im waiting to see if the dual core CPUs are trashed due to a new cooling scheme which is done inside the chip that may make single chip design cheaper and faster than dual core hot design of today. On top of the dual core focus issue I cant find a comfort point with the new Vista OS. I got the changing tech blues.

The deeper I get the less I like what I find. Anything Linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play. I have not given up on it but at this point I'm working through a 3 inch thick book on. I had some success with a live CD version but still don't have a comfort point with it. Have you ever gone to Linuxgames.com?
