Hello, I own a USB Prestigio pocket hard disk 40GB, that has a password protection.
It has 2 visible partitions, 20mb each ( public and AP ) on the AP partition is the autorun for the security.
The drive has been set on the &quot;safer&quot; mode - meaning that it is not so wonerable to disconnect without &quot;safe to disconnect&quot; rutine.
Even so, I guess the forcible ejection must have damaged or corrupted the autorun file ( even though it is write protected ) so I cannot get the program to start and unlock the drive.
I have a lot of important stuff on the hdd, and I dont care about the disk itself - I just want the data back.
Is there a way around this?
I can't attempt to fix the autorun because it is write protected, and without it - I can't unlock the hdd.
Any suggestions and opinions are welcome, thank you.
