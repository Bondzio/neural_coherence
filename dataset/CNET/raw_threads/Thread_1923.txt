I like them better than external wireless network adapters (USB, PC-card/PCMCIA). Range is good, no hardware to lose, keeps USB ports free. Check with your notebook mfg to see what mini-PCI card they recommend. NewEgg.com sells them, too.

PCMCIA for a laptop, you certainly can not use PCI card. The external USB adapter, mean one more thing to carry around. So PCMCIA card have the advantage. Now its up to you, which connection you want, and there are so many brand out there... D-link, Linksys, Netgear, Belkin, Motorola, 3com and many other.

If the laptop in question has a mini-PCI slot, I'd check into it. Here is an example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833106221

With a USB adapter, designers are free to add an external antenna and make it as effective as possible. I have gone through both adapters and by far the usb adapter is the best. I have much fewer dropped connections and it really makes my life easier. Hope this helps

I own a several year old HP like that.
