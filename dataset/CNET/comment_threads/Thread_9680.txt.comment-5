the FX-57 is a great processor made by AMD, and i would say if your into gaming, to go with the FX.
AMD uses its power more efficiently and if you go with dual core, well thats just awesome!
the only problem with double core is the price... i saw places running the FX-57 up to $2000, but its an investment, and i suggest you do some research on some processors... you never know what new chips will come into play.
