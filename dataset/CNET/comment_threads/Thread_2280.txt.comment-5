This is usually how comprehensive the memory check is done.
Some have a setting that does a quick check but will allow a slower more thorough test.
I can't say whether this feature is in your system or tell you where to find it.
But using the full mem test will slow the boot process and possibly let the HD get up to speed before the BIOS goes looking for it.
If the problem is that the POST outruns the hardware readiness state, a device might not show.
