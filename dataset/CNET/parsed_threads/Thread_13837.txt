<s> New HP A1224N and I want to add my old slave to it. </s>
<s> A Maxtor Diamond Max Plus 9 160 GB ATA 133/HD. </s>
<s> But, alas, I am unfamilar with ATA and I don't see a serial connection to install the HD with. </s>
<s> Am I boned on this? </s>
<s> Some questions,, Find the HD that came with the PC. </s>
<s> What kind of cable is hooked to it, a small roundish one with a small connector on the end or a wide flat one with a big 40 pin connector?? </s>
<s> If it is the small doundish one then it is SATA. </s>
<s> If the wide flat one with the big 40 pin then it is ATA. </s>
<s> Now what kind of connector does you old HD have on it?? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> The new HP has ATA and the old slave is 40 pin </s>
<s> I think you mean that the new computer has a 250GB Serial ATA (SATA) drive, and your old 160GB drive is Parallel ATA (PATA). </s>
<s> Keep the 160GB drive jumpered as a slave. </s>
<s> Find the cable that the CD/DVD drive is on. </s>
<s> Insert the middle connector of that cable into the back of the 160GB drive. </s>
<s> Insert a power connector into the back of the 160GB drive. </s>
<s> Power on and test.... </s>
<s> HP Pavilion A1224N Product Information Click ''Motherboard Specifications, PTGD-LA (Goldfish3)'' and then click ''Motherboard layout and photos.'' </s>
<s> I put the slave back into the old machine, hooked it back up to the network and transfered the files. </s>
<s> It was very quick. </s>
<s> Now I will get an external backup and use that as my &quot;safety valve&quot; for my data. </s>
