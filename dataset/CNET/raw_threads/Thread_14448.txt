8723	0	381879	3241384	NR	mifflin	2/6/10 3:25 PM	1.2654699E12	dead boards	I've done three builds in my life...all of them have eventually ended with a fried motherboard. Am I doing something wrong? Should there be some kind insulator between the metal standoffs/board/screws?
8723	1	381879	3241411	3241384	VAPCMD	2/6/10 3:45 PM	1.2654711E12	How long do they last roughly ? Sure your house wiring is	okay ? Are you using a UPS ? VAPCMD
8723	2	381879	3241479	3241411	mifflin	2/6/10 6:08 PM	1.26547968E12	no	no. just a surge protector. and i've never had a problem with the prebuilt systems i've had....just the ones i've built. maybe a string of bad luck
8723	3	381879	3241501	3241479	VAPCMD	2/6/10 6:30 PM	1.265481E12	(NT) Any ideas why the BYOPCs died ... using good PSUs ?	NIL
8723	4	381879	3241912	3241501	mifflin	2/7/10 10:30 AM	1.2655386E12	yeah	On the last one I used an Antec Truepower 2.0 550 Watt. I checked the voltages on the p1 & p4 connectors...it still seems to be providing good power. I'm not completely sure the board is what's bad on this one(i don't see any blown caps)...i'm leaning that way though. I get nothing on the screen when I boot but all the fans come on & the soft power led on the board lights up. I've tried a different cpu. Put a multimeter to the psu...it checks out. I tried an old PCI graphics card to no avail. I'm not sure this board supports pci graphics...i don't see why it wouldn't. I have two sticks of 1gb ddr2 i was running in it. I swapped both of those in & out, so it's not the ram unless both sticks died at the same time.

Then clear the BIOS and check/replace the CMOS battery. (I start with cardboard for all PCs I build). Re the PCI graphics ... give it a try. Re standoffs....I use only 2 or 3 brass standoffs and for the rest I use the old plastic standoffs with the bottoms cut off. Haven't used the paper washers for years. VAPCMD
8723	6	381879	3242082	3241384	Brechan	2/7/10 3:02 PM	1.26555492E12	dead boards	Any chance we can have the make/ model number of the motherboard, so we can possibly dig a little deeper into this puzzle?
8723	7	381879	3242170	3242082	mifflin	2/7/10 6:54 PM	1.26556884E12	sure	The board is an Asus A8N-E.
8723	8	381879	3242208	3242170	VAPCMD	2/7/10 7:31 PM	1.26557106E12	Hmm...I've still got an A8N-Sli Deluxe and it still works	I've since moved to an i860 and Win 7. Might see what the ASUS forum has for the A8N-E MB ? VAPCMD
8723	9	381879	3242775	3242007	mifflin	2/8/10 12:31 PM	1.26563226E12	esd	What about ESD? Do you use anything else besides the cardboard? Sometimes I'll use a wriststrap, sometimes I just try to touch the case. I wonder if this could be the root of all my problems. I've never been exactly sure how sensitive the components are. I've heard some say they never worry about and others say you have to be extremely careful.
8723	10	381879	3242842	3242775	VAPCMD	2/8/10 2:01 PM	1.26563766E12	ESD ... possible but I don't see it is a likely	cause for component failure after extended use. Right wrong or otherwise I think of ESD as killing something immediately vice days, weeks or months later. Advice re handling ... never touch components parts .. like RAM, CPUs, MBs, GPUs, etc., ... except by the edges. Thus far...20 plus years, that's served me well. VAPCMD
8723	11	381879	3242887	3242170	Brechan	2/8/10 2:50 PM	1.2656406E12	Just a couple more questions from me...	In regards to your last 3 BYOPC's: 1) Was it the same make and model of motherboard? 2) How long before the system went belly-up? 3) Can I post your original message on the ASUS forums ( with the addition of of the make/ model #'s included)?
8723	12	381879	3242941	3242887	mifflin	2/8/10 3:23 PM	1.26564258E12	re:	1. They were not the same boards. My first build was a an Athlon Thunderbird...I can't remember the make & model of the first board that fried but I want to say it was Asus. I had a tech replace that for me with a Jetway V266B which also fried. The Jetway has some pretty obvious blown caps. 2. It was probably more than a year before it bit the dust. It's been sitting in my closet for a few months. I'm just now getting around to resurrecting it. 3.Please do.
8723	13	381879	3243862	3242941	Brechan	2/9/10 3:32 PM	1.26572952E12	Sorry it took so long, work and all...	you know how it is. Anyway, have been checking through the ASUS forums (so many questions, so many problems, sooo many pages)and have still a few more questions. Can you recall (before you put this mobo in the closet) what symtoms it had before the computer died? -BSOD -constant or random crashing -PSU working, mobo power light on but no power to rest of the computer -system stops before getting to POST screen -fan warning at startup, &quot;Chip fan speed too low&quot; -smoke, flames ? The one problem I did see noted quite often was the failure of the chipset fan. But aside from this, if you could answer these quesitons, I might be able to dig deeper in to ASUS
8723	14	381879	3244795	3243862	mifflin	2/10/10 5:39 PM	1.26582354E12	re:	Not a problem. Thanks for your help. It's been a while since it crashed. But here's what i can remember: -Don't recall any BSODs -there was some random crashing growing more frequent towards then end -the psu seems to be working. the light comes on all fans spin. the voltages check out on a multimeter -nothing displays on the screen at all. like the monitor isn't plugged in. no beep codes either -no fan warnings -no smoke or fire The chipset fan does turn.
8723	15	381879	3244799	3244795	Brechan	2/10/10 5:57 PM	1.26582462E12	Bad Caps?	http://www.badcaps.net/pages.php?vid=5
8723	16	381879	3244818	3244795	Brechan	2/10/10 6:06 PM	1.26582516E12	what CPU are you using?	is it new or older?
