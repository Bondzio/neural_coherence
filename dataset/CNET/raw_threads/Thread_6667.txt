I was not aware that this card was part of a complete sound system, including the DVD drive. My computer is a COMPAQ Presario 6000 series, with which I use an NEC DVD ND-3520(in external enclosure) My question is; can I make any use of the CT7230, to my advantage, even only to improve my current graphics? I down-loaded the User Guide for the PC-DVD Encore 6x Dxr3 card from Creative's excellent web-site, but this refers to a complete installation of the system. Is it worth the effort to install the card in my PC and if so, what leads would I need and what would be the procedure?

I'd sell that thing since it's far too hard on today's owners and is best for those that want DVD play on a Pentium 2 machine. Bob

I can not find any way to download info from Creative's website. Not to mention they no longer support this card. I also bought one. with no driver or manual. thanks
