I tried looking around the internet for any information at all but there wasn't much to find about it, so i was wondering if any one here might know anything about it.

If you want to keep it but safe why not a computer museum? I've seen the better ones let you put it on display but keep ownership. Bob

I did find a little information, but there just isn't much available. If you are interested, I may be able to help with the sale. Not sure how to pm on this forum, but if you reply with interest we can figure something out.
