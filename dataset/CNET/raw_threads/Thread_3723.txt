I changed my color profiles to prophoto rgb, which helped out tremendously--but only in windows picture viewer. I don't notice any difference at all in terms of desktop color. The vista sidebar, thumbnails, and non-icc compatible programs all display the hideous oversaturated colors. I mean, reds practically glow with a supernatural aura. The monitor has been &quot;calibrated&quot; with visual tools (not spending money on colorimeter) and is accurate within reason with those tools (gamma, brightness, and contrast). Again, color is awful on the desktop and most other apps except picture viewer. Hardware: HP Pavilion Elite d5100t ATI Radeon 4850 graphics card HP w2558hc monitor Let me know if any more relevant hardware is required.

For anyone else who may be wondering the same thing or pulling their hair out over the matter, Windows Explorer is NOT ICC profile-aware. So Vista/XP itself will not really manifest the color profiles, but your photos, etc. in aware applications will (like Windows Picture Viewer, Photoshop, etc.). I confirmed the effects myself by looking at another very new system that features a Samsung T240HD monitor with an Nvidia GTS250 graphics card and it had a very similar cast to all images in Windows Explorer--the same oversaturation of reds and oranges. I guess this is more of a windows problem for now...
