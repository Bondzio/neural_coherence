<s> I currently have a Sony VAIO that I got a year and a half ago. </s>
<s> Specs are: 2.4ghz P4 512mb RAM 80gb HD PCI GeForce FX 5200 128mb which I added. </s>
<s> I'm very into Half-life 2 and CS:Source. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade to AGP. </s>
<s> Could anyone recommend a motherboard, a soundcard, and a video card? </s>
<s> I would like the video card to be around 150-200. </s>
<s> Also, do I need to replace my processor? </s>
<s> I would also like to add more RAM (maybe another 512mb). </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Matt </s>
<s> check out tomshardware.com for info regarding video card performance and memory. </s>
<s> They have good info regarding the latest motherboards too. </s>
<s> in conjuction with that, its nice to read reviews from newegg.com on the products before you buy them. </s>
<s> Most likely, the ram you recieved with the VAIO is cruddy (slow), so expect to replace that. </s>
<s> Determine the motherboard you are getting before you decide on the ram. </s>
<s> I think your cpu speed is fine for now. </s>
