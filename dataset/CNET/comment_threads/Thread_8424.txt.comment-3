Thanks for the info.
I figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the U.S., but I guess there's no way around that.
It looks like that Gateway PC doesn't come with a monitor.
According to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so I guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference.
Couldn't tell from the page, but does that PC include DVD-RAM as well?
And, did it have TV capability?
Thanks again for the link.
