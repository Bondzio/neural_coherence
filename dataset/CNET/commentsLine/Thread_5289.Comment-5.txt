creative cards have better in game sound and faster acceleration resulting in faster framerates than any other brand of sound card.
benchmarks on the audigy 2 and later series have proven this.
turtle beach is an ok card but won't produce the same framerates.
m-audio's revolution has better sound quality than an audigy 2 for music/dvd, but can't match the audigy's game performance.
and an $80 x-fi will match the m-audio's sound.
and eax 3+ is much better at positioning than direct sound.
the difference is so dramatic that anyone can tell the difference.
