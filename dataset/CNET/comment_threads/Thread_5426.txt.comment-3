Just as a matter of interest, who makes the &quot;caddy&quot; that takes a Laptop HD and makes it connect to a USB port?
Sounds like a piece of kit that could come in handy.
I use an adapter to connect laptop drives to an IDE cable and take power from the computers power supply or from an external drive enclosure.
My other question is how do you put AC into a device that only needs DC?
Sounds like a design flaw.
On another note, was the HD working before you sent the machine away and does the drive only fit into the caddy, one way.
How do you determine which pins carry the DC voltage for the drive?
