1.2.1	Believe you could do as well or better especially on the power supply , HS Fan cooler , etc. , If you have n't looked at video cards ( GPUs ) , take a look here ... http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6950-1gb-geforce-gtx-560-ti-gaming-graphics-card,2857.html Hope this helps .	St

1.3.1	Congratulations on deciding to build your first computer .	St
1.3.2	It is a very rewarding and educational process that can also save considerable money - a little with the first build and even more later when you upgrade reusing many of the basic components .	St
1.3.3	I would not recommend that package for gaming : 1 .	St
1.3.4	Has a lot more CPU power than you need for gaming - and note that it includes no graphics card .	St
1.3.5	2 .	St
1.3.6	You are paying a premium for mobo that matches CPU - you can save on both to allocate more to GP 3 .	St
1.3.7	The power supply is not one of the models most people recommend and is not rated as highly as others for the same money at the sites that rank them 4 .	St
1.3.8	You can get a better heatsink/fan for less money .	St
1.3.9	To get a start on picking components , you might consider these links : 1 .	Sug
1.3.10	For general information and guides on building : http : //www.tomshardware.com/forum/288241-31-read-posting-buyer-guides-troubleshooting 2 .	St
1.3.11	A specific list of recommended components at different price levels from list in # 1 : http : //www.tomshardware.com/forum/269162-31-recommended-builds-usage Note that at about one-third way down page you will see two recommended builds for about $ 1,000 INCLUDING GRAPHICS CARD , that would be better than your choice above ( note that neither these builds or the one you selected above include operating syste , monitor , mouse of keyboard so you need to ensure you leave money in budget for these if you need to purchase them ) 3 .	St
1.3.12	Tom 's Hardware Guide ( one of the most respected computer sites on the internet ) has a recommended build model that includes the components list and a lot of discussion about the selections http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/build-a-pc-core-i3-overclock-system-builder,2809.html 4 .	St
1.3.13	Great information about selecting and installing graphics cards with lots of links to other resources : http : //www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html Note that you can build a respectible gaming rig for about $ 600 to $ 800 , depending on preferences .	St
1.3.14	For $ 1,000 you should get a powerful enthusiast rig .	St
1.4.1	Thank you very much for your insightful guide .	St
1.4.2	You made my life much easier and helped me save alot of money .	St
1.4.3	I really appreciate your help .	Polite
1.5.1	I agree with rockyjohns in that you could get a better gaming rig then trying a package from any on-line store .	St
1.5.2	You first have to decide on which processor will give the best power for the game or games you wish to play .	St
1.5.3	I have read that an Intel Core I3 Processor will play the most intensive games currently available in conjunction with a good gpu card .	St
1.5.4	I have found that watching a great number of & quot ; building a gaming pc & quot ; videos on youtube were very helpful .	St
1.5.5	Good luck on your build .	Polite
1.5.6	P.S .	St
1.5.7	Most web site have a disclaimer that states the bundled components may not be compatable with each other .	St

1.7.3	Re Sandy Bridge ...	St
1.7.4	Depends on when you plan to build .	St

1.7.6	Re ... thermal grease ... .not a problem ... .just order some Arctic Silver from Newegg ... always good to extra grease ... just in case you need to reinstall it .	St
