Hi all!
I've been looking for a solution for this problem for two days now!
My phone, laptop, and Roku device all can connect to the D-Link router, but cannot access the wireless network.
Everything gets hung up when it tries to obtain the IP address.
I've tried ipconfic/release and renew, ect.
I'm truly lost as to what to do next as I'm no computer pro!
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
