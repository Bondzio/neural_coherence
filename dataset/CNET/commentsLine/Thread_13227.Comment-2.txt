that card plugs into a normal pci express slot on the motherboard.
i don't think the power supply has anything to do with it.
forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim.
a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system.
besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...
