funny story.
i can't understand you.
1. what &quot;bios setting&quot; and what is a &quot;ide&quot;?
2. are you suggesting that i need a driver disk that i didn't get with the hard drive or win2k?
if so what driver do i need?
the reason i didn't respond for so long is that i couldn't log into my forum account.
:p p.s.
just another reminder, &quot;me am dumb&quot; it's the reason i came here to begin with.
:\
