i am having a problem with my hard drive and am afraid it will fail.
i have a second hard drive in my system that was set up to shadow the c drive.
i disabled that second drive after i received the computer, so this drive is essentially new.
do i have to do anything to the second drive, since it does have a couple of files on it to be able to use it as a primary drive?
any help would be appreciated.
i am running windows xp home edition.
