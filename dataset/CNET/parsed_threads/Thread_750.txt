<s> I had to install a new hard-drive on my Pentium 4 Dell 8100 series computer. </s>
<s> Win-Me operating-Explorer 6.0. </s>
<s> Maxter Hard-Drive 180 gig. </s>
<s> I installed the drive, used the disk sent by the Manufacturer to format the drive for operating system install. </s>
<s> I installed Win_me then started to install my accessories, usb printer,usb- scanner, and didgital camera usb. </s>
<s> Everything was fine up to this point. </s>
<s> When I installed my DSL modem( with disk from manufacturer) I was asked to restart system to enable device. </s>
<s> I did, and now all I can get on START_UP is TWO NEW HARDWARE found messages. </s>
<s> One for an UNKNOWN Item the other for a PCI Controller. </s>
<s> I even contacted the vendors for each of my devices and under their instructions removed and reinstalled each item with a new restart each time but the new hardware boxes still pop up at each restart. </s>
<s> If you let windows search for the best driver, none is found. </s>
<s> I removed ALL add-on items, printer, camera, scanner, modem, etc., did a clean boot and the messages still appear at each restart. </s>
<s> Each vendor for my add-on items say their product has nothing to do with either NEW Found Hardware message. </s>
<s> HELP! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> that the new hardware are actually MOTHERBOARD devices and you should be using the motherboard cd to install them with. </s>
<s> The easiest way if you don't have that cd is to first get on the net to the maker of the board and download the newest drivers for the board that are available. </s>
<s> If you don't know what hardware devices are in your system use the free on-line scan at Belarc and it will list the maker and model numbers for all your currently installed hardware (physically in the case, not necessary driver installed yet). </s>
<s> The report is printable, but you may not have your printer up and running yet so you will have to write them all down manually. </s>
<s> And that's only if you are able to get on the net since you may be here using a different computer completely. </s>
<s> BELARC Hardware ID: This one is FREE. </s>
<s> Run it on line, D/L or copy to a floppy (500K+). </s>
<s> Anyone who is wondering what is in their machine should find this useful. </s>
<s> http://www.belarc.com/Download.html The &quot;Belarc Advisor&quot; is useful, and free for personal use. </s>
<s> It &quot;builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware.&quot; It runs on Windows 95/98/Me, NT 4, Windows 2000 and XP, and in just a minute or so, creates a local web page (one that resides on your PC--- nothing is sent back to Belarc). </s>
<s> The page contains a rundown of all the hardware in and attached to your system, plus information on all the installed software including license and version numbers. </s>
<s> Makes a handy reference. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> I do have Belarc and used it to get all info on my system and went online to manufactures and downloaded ALL updated drivers and installed them all. </s>
<s> But to no avail. </s>
<s> I still get the same hardware issues each time I restart my system. </s>
<s> It is a 'pesky' problem for sure. </s>
<s> Thanks for the information. </s>
<s> If thats not it, it will just say &quot;Cannot find drivers on this disc&quot;. </s>
<s> In fact, you should have tried nearly every disc you own, including Windows. </s>
<s> Then you look for a driver you know you don't have. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Yes I did everything from contacting manufacturer of motherboard and computer maker and redownloaded every driver that they had for this board, plus uninstalled, and reinstalled every attachment to my system but still get the same errors on start-up. </s>
<s> Belarc only shows the items I have on my system at present so why would these found new hardware errors keep coming up? </s>
<s> They are so much fun and SO reliable. </s>
<s> Just a long shot, but have you tried clearing your CMOS? </s>
<s> All you would have to do then is reset the clock. </s>
<s> Record your current BIOS settings first. </s>
<s> Sometimes they can get someting irrelevant stuck in their feeble little minds and won't let go of it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
