since you use shared ram for video and system, you got to get at least 1gb of ram installed under xp.
then try to replace the video with a video card to return said ram back to system only and find at least 128mb or more video based video card.
that will greatly improve you're gaming but if you use the top game level setting, it will drag again, so find a happy medium until you finally replace system with the latest and greatest.
