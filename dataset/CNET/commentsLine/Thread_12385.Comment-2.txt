to do this right you need a load balancer.
still that is only the network side.
the servers themselves have to be able keep track of each others status and detect any failure.
this gets very complex very fast since you have issue like open files and databases to deal with and that does not even start to think about open sessions to a end users that you would want to fail over.
if you are good with linux you can most likely get most this done for free.
if you do not have the skills you are better off paying a hosting company.
