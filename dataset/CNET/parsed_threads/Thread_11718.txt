<s> I use an HP computer and my OS is Win XP. </s>
<s> I get 10Mbps download from my ISP and it's up to speed. </s>
<s> I have disconnected the modem electrically and also reset it to no avail. </s>
<s> I did this with a Tech from my ISP. </s>
<s> I read a lot of business articles on CNBC. </s>
<s> My computer downloads a printed page, then freezes and the print disappears leaving me a totally white page. </s>
<s> After 5 seconds the printed page reappears and the mouse wheel becomes operational about 5 seconds after that. </s>
<s> This also happens when I download some page from the internet that is not a page of print. </s>
<s> That is, the system just seems to freeze and then after a few seconds I can navagate in the page with my mouse. </s>
<s> Is this a buffering problem? </s>
<s> Could the problem be with my OS, Win XP? </s>
<s> Any help to cure this greatfully appreciated. </s>
<s> Does this happen on all web pages? </s>
<s> My Internet Explorer version is 8.06001.18702 Cipher strength is 128.5 Updates = 0 Yes this happens on all pages. </s>
<s> Thanks for trying to help an old pastor! </s>

<s> Example at http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html Also, while you are in there, check if the CPU heat sink is on proper. </s>
<s> Another member had such issues and they found the heat sink was connected with only 3 of the 4 pins. </s>

<s> Desktop Maintenance. </s>
<s> About once a month I delete all of the files in my Recycle Bin. </s>
<s> I use Outlook Express and once a month I delete all of the files in the Outbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, and Drafts. </s>
<s> In Internet Explorer about once a month I delete all of the files Temporary Internet files, Cookies, History of websites visited and InPrivatae Filtering Data. </s>
<s> I don't think I have the knowledge or skills to check the CPU heat sink. </s>
<s> This problem is relatively new, like a month, so I doubt that could be the problem. </s>
<s> But, if I can't get it fixed, I take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink. </s>
<s> Out of curiosity, what are you using for a printer and how do you have it hooked uP? </s>
<s> Not sure if it is you problem but when you read pdf files you sometime see this stalling. </s>
<s> It seems sometimes it wants to load a large piece of the file before it displays it but it does not tell you it is still downloading. </s>
<s> If you mess with when its in this condition I have had it then refuse to load that document untill I clear all the cache things. </s>
<s> For links that are PDF files you can generally get around this right click the link and save as. </s>
<s> If you have issue on general web pages that are HTML only hard to say .... </s>
<s> I tend to blame the firewall/virus software first for any strange problems. </s>
<s> The CNET Video I supplied covers the basics. </s>
<s> If you are not doing this yearly then your machine eventually has issues very much like you posted. </s>
<s> I have begun to wonder if this is why most folk buy new machines. </s>
<s> They don't do the basic maintenance. </s>

<s> Downloading PDG pages from the web are interrupted also. </s>
<s> All pages of print from the web are interrupted. </s>
<s> If I go to my home page, CNBC, it isn't interrupted but it probably takes more than 10 seconds to load because there's such a lot of content. </s>
<s> The last things to load are the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P figures and then I can go to other articles or videos offereb by the site. </s>
<s> Another thing I've noticed is that while the my computer seems to be stalled or the download is still going on, I can move my mouse arrow around but neither the left or right buttons work nor does the wheel word. </s>
<s> In addition, the arrow doesn't change into an hourglass to indicate it is downloading. </s>
