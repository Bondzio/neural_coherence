<s> Hey everyone this is my first post here. </s>
<s> I am not a networking expert and I need some help and possible clarification. </s>
<s> First let me start off by saying I currently am switching from Hughes Net broadband internet service. </s>
<s> (Satellite) I will be replacing it with the Basic DSL service from AT&T. </s>
<s> Now, I have two offices currently networked (wired) together and because I am on the Basic DSL service plan (will upgrade when available) I would like for each office to have its own connection to the internet to lighten the load. </s>
<s> Yet, I still want them to be networked for file sharing. </s>
<s> This is what I envision: Office One: Modem 1 Router 1 -Will be given the address of 192.168.1.1 -Will not be set as a DHCP Server -Will allow IP connections from 192.168.1.2-50 Hey everyone this is my first post here. </s>

<s> Even though I have two separate routers, which will be connected by a SWITCH will, the computers still connect on the same network. </s>
<s> Will I have to use the RIP feature? </s>
<s> If so how exactly does this work? </s>
<s> Will my routers recognize one another and now that the clients are on the same network and allow them to communicate? </s>
<s> (My SWITCH does not have the option to change any settings.) </s>
<s> I know about Dual WAN routers but have never worked with them. </s>
<s> Also, from my understanding the second WAN is for back-up purposes only. </s>
<s> Unless, you can specifiy on a Dual WAN router which computers use what connection I do not think it would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks, Tommy </s>
<s> Okay I am thinking that if I set both modem RIP Directions to &quot;Both&quot; then they will recognize what host (client) is where and that should ensure they stay on the same network. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> One DSL modem per DSL line. </s>
<s> Period. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> You cannot put a switch in front of a modem. </s>
<s> Period. </s>
<s> (And expect it to work.) </s>
<s> Possible resolution. </s>
<s> DSL line -&gt; DSL modem -&gt; Wireless router -&gt; various computers connected via Ethernet cable and/or wireless. </s>
<s> Set File and Printer Sharing on all PCs. </s>
<s> It will be DSL Modem 1 --- &gt; Router 1 ---&gt; Switch &lt;---- Router 2 &lt;--- DSL Modem 2 | | Clients 1 Clients 2 The switch is only necessary to connect the two Routers as they will be a block away from one another. </s>
<s> I believe if I have the RIP feature on each Router set to &quot;Both&quot; then they will communicate. </s>
<s> Hopefully, this makes more sense. </s>
<s> I have two seperate DSL Lines. </s>
<s> I know that is a necessity. </s>
<s> This is my current setup with my Satellite Modem: Modem ---&gt; Router ---&gt; Switch ---&gt; All Clients Thanks, Tommy </s>
