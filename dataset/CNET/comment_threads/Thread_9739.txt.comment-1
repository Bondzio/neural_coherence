I have tried to install OFFICE XP Service Pack 3 on my Win 2000 machine and it always tells me the installation was unsuccessful.
I have used the 17 MB package and the 54 MB and get the same thing.
I checked the programs that come with the Office programs and they all show that I have SP3 but the automatic update says I need to install it.
Can anyone help me with this?
Thanks in advance.
