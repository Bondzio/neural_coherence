hi thanks for the response, i have read a good few of the topics on this forum with similar problems to my own but am still no closer to fixing the problem, after trying a few of the data recovery program suggested (sadly none worked), i took the hd out of the enclosure and put it into my desktop as a secondary sata drive - then turned this drive to auto in the setup.
however upon bootup i get &quot;error auto-sensing secondary hard drive drive 0&quot; click f1 to continue and it starts to boot but then resets i.e.
i never get into the os with the hd turned on.
so i am still no nearer to recovering the data that is on the drive anyone else any suggestion that i could try?
again thanks for all your help, ger.
