<s> I HAV A HOME PC IN WHICH I WANNA INSTALL A SPEAKER SYSTEM OS: WINDOWS XP SPEAKER:TECH-COM SPEAKER CODE:SSD-802 PLEASE HELP ME THANX IN ADVANCE </s>
<s> Hopefully you realize the power output advertised on these is bogus. </s>
<s> You get 10 w RMS and not 800 to 900 watts the various dealers specify. </s>
<s> Anyway, you generally just need a shielded cable that plugs into your sound card's jack and into the speaker's input jack. </s>
<s> The speaker set should probably come with such a cable. </s>
<s> There are no drivers or such needed. </s>
<s> Just plug it in, turn up the volume and hope it works. </s>
<s> an error occurs when i play my music it says &quot;Windows Media Player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device. </s>
<s> There may not be a sound device installed on your computer, it may be in use by another program, or it may not be functioning properly.&quot; please help n thanx to u that u r helping me </s>
<s> You either have a defective, disabled, or a device without drivers installed. </s>
<s> You can check the sound device status under Device Manager (Right click on My Computer, go to Properties and then Hardware/Device Manager. </s>
<s> You should see a listing for sound and gaming devices. </s>
<s> A yellow exclamation point usually means no driver, a red X means disabled, and no listing means no sound device. </s>
<s> If your RCA jack is along the motherboard card edge, you have an on board device. </s>
<s> It may be that it's not enabled in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Do a good search for a sound device on your system as a first step. </s>
<s> i'll try this out at once i hope it works thanx again </s>
