I am having a problem installing a Geforce FX5500 AGP card in a Compaq Presario SR1420UK.
The machine is an AMD 3000, 512mb Ram with onboard graphics.
I have selected AGP/Onboard as the primary graphics in the BIOS but still no joy.
With the monitor plugged into the card when I switch on the monitor works while its going through its POST, when it starts to load up Windows (XP) the screen goes black.
Anyone any ideas from here?
