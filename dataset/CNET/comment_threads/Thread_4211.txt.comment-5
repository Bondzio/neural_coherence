I think the point Bob implies is very important, use a good branded disk, not the cheap spikes you can pick up at the computer fairs.
For CDs, my preference is Imation and for DVDs Titanium single layer 4.7 MB (the brand, not the metal!).
For anything important, be sure to use -R and not -RW, the erasable disks do decay quicker.
And also as Bob mentions, do store them correctly - I use regular width cases with a black back to keep the light away from the recorded surface or better yet, the fully enclosed black DVD cases.
Keep them cool, dry and out of direct sunlight and handle only with the edges.
and don't go sticking labels on the disks - write a disk number in the clear bit in the middle and then label the cases, not the disks.
