Just one link google found for PORTABLE SCANNER: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363822,00.asp Also have a look at http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_11?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=portable+scanner&sprefix=portable+sc%2Caps%2C363 I even see a VuPoint Magic Wand with the note: &quot;Only 5 left in stock.
Order soon.&quot; It's 900 dpi in stead of the 1200 dpi that isn't available yet.
Since you don't tell WHY the 1200 dpi would be perfect, it could be a 900 dpi is good enough.
Personally I never scan with more that 400 dpi, I think.
