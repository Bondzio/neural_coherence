my daughters laptop (fujitsu siemens amili pi 1505) suddenly stopped working while she was busy with internet and ms word.
reboot says operating system not found.
bios recognises fujitsu mhv2080bh sata1 drive, shown as ide (80 gb).
things i tried: - reboot from original recovery disk (windows xp sp2).
loads all drivers.
after that there's only a black screen with with a cursor in the upper left corner.
disc access led loops: 7 seconds burning, 1 second off.
- locate a fujitsu hard drive diagnostic on  .
they only have one for ide.
however, it needs to be run from a dos bootable device and the laptop has no diskette drive.
i wonder if it's worth the trouble to make a bootable cd or a bootable usb.
- download a general hard disk diagnostic (mhdd - comes with iso for a bootable cd).
that finds only the dvd/rw and no trace of the hard disk.
any other option than going to the repair shop and ask them to check the cables and then put a new hard disk in (and check it by installing windows xp)?
it's not something i'd like to do myself.
and yes, i happened to make a backup last week.
and explained about the need to store files on a usb-stick or in her gmail.
