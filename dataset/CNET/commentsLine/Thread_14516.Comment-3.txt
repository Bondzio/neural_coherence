thanks, bob.
i read some of the articles from &quot;macosx hints&quot; with a lot of caveats and &quot;buts,&quot; but maybe those problems have been solved now.
i also looked at one site offering a variety of dongles.
not sure what characterizes the more expensive ones from the modestly priced ones, and i can't say i really understand all the terms, but when i get a chance, i'll read descriptions and try to decipher it all.
maybe i'll take the plunge, maybe not.
it's something to consider when i have some more time.
i do thank you very much, especially, for leading me to what to google.
now i can return, at a less pressured time, to read more and make a decision.
best, though in haste, jenny
