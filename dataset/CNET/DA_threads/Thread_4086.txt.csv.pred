1.1.1	Hello everybody!	St
1.1.2	I thought I would be moving on up after I bought an Asus P4S533-MX motherboard with a Pentium 4 1.7 GHZ processor and 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM on an auction website, but instead I am moving on down.	St
1.1.3	lol I installed it in my computer case and it worked great for a week.	St
1.1.4	I was running Vista on it and everything was going well until it started giving me errors and the blue screen of death and it kept restarting.	St
1.1.5	Then I thought maybe the operating system isn't agreeing with the motherboard or some hardware connected to my motherboard so I took out my old Windows XP cd and tried installing that.	St
1.1.6	As it was installing, that is when an error occurred and it would restart my computer.	St
1.1.7	Then I thought maybe my hard drive is going bad, but it wasn't going bad when I put my old motherboard back in.	St
1.1.8	Now I think I have a memory problem.	St
1.1.9	I can't pinpoint if there's a problem with the 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM or a problem with the memory slots.	St
1.1.10	My motherboard can take both DDR or SDRAM.	St
1.1.11	I took out the DDR and put some working SDRAM in.	St
1.1.12	I turned on my computer and it kept beeping at me.	St
1.1.13	Nothing was showing up on my monitor screen.	St
1.1.14	Do you think I need to set something in the bios or on the motherboard to make it realize I am using SDRAM or do you think I have a memory slot problem?	St
1.1.15	When I put the DDR back in, it starts up perfectly.	St
1.1.16	I took the bios off of quick boot and it ran a test ont he meory and it said that the memory failed.	St
1.1.17	So now I think I have bad DDR RAM.	St
1.1.18	So how can I get this motherboard to see my good SDRAM?	St
1.1.19	If you all think my memory slots have gone capooey, do you all think I should get another motherboard or is there a way of saving this motherboard?	St
1.1.20	I almost forgot to tell you that I have the latest bios for this motherboard.	St
1.1.21	It is 1006.	St
1.1.22	I can't wait to see what solutions you have for me.	Sug
1.1.23	Thank you for reading this!	St
1.2.1	I had many jumpers to move.	St
1.2.2	It was not automatic.	St
1.2.3	Time to read the motherboard manual.	St
1.3.1	I found out that I have a jumperfree motherboard so there's no way of setting a jumper on my motherboard to recognize the sdram.	St
1.3.2	I ran across something as I was googling.	St
1.3.3	A person was told by an Asus vendor that the sdram controllers on this motherboard aren't stable.	St
1.3.4	I have a feeling there's no way of making them stable.	St
1.3.5	I think I'll be buying a new motherboard.	St
1.4.1	I often run into this but it's very rare.	St
1.4.2	Most &quot;bum&quot; boards are blown out of the market fast so you don't find them at newegg.com or such.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
