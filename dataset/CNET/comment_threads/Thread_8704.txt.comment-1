Hi, I am looking for an HDTV tuner or someway to watch TV on my computer.
I prefer not to actually buy the service like cable and pay monthly but to rather pick-up some local channels.
Here are my comp specs: 2.8GHZ P4 1024MB PC3200 GeForce ti 4600 QDI SIS Superb4FX, Motherboard.
Broadband I know that if I buy a tv tuner card thingie it'll most likely be from either ATI or Nvidia, i think.
Also can a TV tuner card like run WITH my other card.
I'm not looking for SLI or anything just wondering if I can use both at the same time.
Thanks in advance Ibrhaim jadoon
