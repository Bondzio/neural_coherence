&quot;three short beeps, indicating bad base 64k memory&quot; this points to missing or incompatible ram.
the basics here are.
1. make sure the power supply is connected proper.
i did not read the full manual but if there is an atx12v connection, connect it.
2. clear the cmos.
i've seen this happen on machines where the owner had overclocked.
3. if the prior owner had updated the bios and failed, the cost of fixing this issue usually costs more than another board!
