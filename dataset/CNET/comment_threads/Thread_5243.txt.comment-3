I have a WDC WD2500JD-75HBCO (233 gb)hard drive in there now.
It says that there is 229 gb (182gb-80% free space)NTFS I don't think that more hard disk space is nessasary with all that free space.
Running XP Home He has these games on.
Desert Combat Battle Field 2 Call of Duty 2 Postal 2 Delta Force Black Hawlk Down I have a NVIDIA Ge Force 6800.
The system gets slow some times when he is doing online gaming etc.
I thought that the extra memory to juggle with might help.
I don't really know anything about computers so maybe I'm wrong.
