<s> I am in the market for a webcam. </s>
<s> This will be my first. </s>
<s> Basically, I am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality. </s>
<s> I only plan to use it for video conversations via msn. </s>
<s> This little number caught my eye recently on newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830108129 I gladly welcome any purchasing advice. </s>
<s> Especially in regards to what features I should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality. </s>
<s> Many thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Just a suggestion. </s>
<s> Offer the make and model as well so others can see what you were looking at. </s>
<s> -&gt; A recurring issue with all such work is the lack of good lighting. </s>
<s> There are few cheap cameras that will overcome bad lighting (I'll write none.) </s>

<s> The link is for the Logitech QuickCam Fusion. </s>
<s> It got a 7.6/5.7 from CNET's editors/users and 4 out of 5 eggs from Newegg users. </s>
<s> Currently it costs about $80 and has a $40 rebate. </s>
<s> Sorry the link did not work for you. </s>
<s> For whatever reason it still works for me though. </s>
<s> I will definitely try to be more courteous when posting links in the future. </s>
<s> That's a pretty bold statement regarding webcams in bad lighting. </s>
<s> I will primarily be using the camera at night when lighting is less than optimal since the people I will speak to are literally halfway around the globe. </s>
<s> Needless to say this will be a big issue for me. </s>
<s> How much should I be expecting to pay and what should I make sure that I get for my money? </s>
<s> All you need to do is watch other's uploads to youtube to see that many don't understand lighting. </s>
<s> Your model is too similar to other webcams I own. </s>
<s> To get good results I have to add more light to the room than what you would suspect. </s>
<s> A pair of 100 Watt lights in addition to the normal room lighting worked for me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 2 100watt light bulbs? </s>
<s> Wow! </s>
<s> Hope the bulk of your video conferencing is not at night! </s>
<s> What would be considered different? </s>
<s> I'm reading lots of reviews and the majority of the complaints come from models that are incompatible or have problematic software or drivers. </s>
<s> Notice how much light he pours into it. </s>
<s> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OePFgmyvnWo I wonder if you've done this before. </s>
<s> Those that pan lighting tips usually haven't been at this long. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since this would be the first webcam I'm getting obviously I haven't any experience with them. </s>
<s> I'm not panning your lighting tips though. </s>
<s> Sorry if you got that impression. </s>
<s> What I was getting at though, was you said that the camera I saw was no different from the ones you owned. </s>
<s> So I'm asking, what would be different? </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I am at work now so I can't view Youtube links. </s>
<s> But I will check it out at home. </s>
<s> Finally saw that link you posted. </s>
<s> That was a fascinating video. </s>
<s> Thanks again for sharing. </s>
<s> I'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however. </s>
<s> I'd just like to use it for video IM, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, I don't think I'd mind. </s>
<s> I do appreciate your responses though. </s>
<s> The basics apply to getting good video. </s>
<s> As I own too many webcams all I can do is share how I get good video. </s>
