I have posted this problem in the &quot;Hardware&quot; forum, but perhaps it belongs here (?).
I have an IBM NetVista 6578PAU w/ Pentium III, 866mHZ chip, Win98SE, 256mB RAM, Intel 815 chipset video BI, 17&quot; Sylvania CL772 LCD monitor W/VESA DDC (digital display channel).
Apparently, the VESA DDC will not allow anything other than a 480 x 600 display w/16 colors.
I downloaded a new driver from the Proview.com website, but the closest one they had was for a 713/716 & it does nothing for my problem.
Any ideas?
