HP scanning software often defaults to a 24 bit color mode, even if you're scanning black and white documents.
The scanner and its software can't determine what you're scanning.
You have to set the requirements yourself.
If you just want to scan black &amp; white text documents, there should be a setting in your scanning software that is labeled as such i.e., &quot;black &amp; white,&quot; or just, &quot;text.&quot; Avoid settings for, &quot;256 shades of gray,&quot; unless you need it for some kind of black and white image, and avoid the OCR option unless you actually need to attempt text editing on the final document.
OCR recognition will only work well if you're scanning very legible text and it will also add to the file size of the finished document.
Most of this should be in the Help menus of scanning software.
