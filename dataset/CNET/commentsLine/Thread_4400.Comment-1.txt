approximately every 4 minutes (i've timed it) i get a short blink or flicker in my primary display.
it is very short and only blinks/flickers just once, but it happens every 4 minutes.
it has blinked in my secondary display a few times, but almost everytime it blinks on the primary display.
and it only blinks on one display, not both displays at the same time.
i have disabled my virus software and that didn't help.
i don't have any games, so it's not game related.
it happens no matter what software i'm running.
i can have only windows open, and it happens.
i can sit and watch the monitor and it blinks when i'm doing nothing on the computer.
but it's 4 minutes between each blink.
it doesn't make any difference if the system has just started, or if i've had it on for 4 hours.
strange?
anyone heard of anything like this?
