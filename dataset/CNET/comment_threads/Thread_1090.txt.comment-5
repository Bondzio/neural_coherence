Dell parts are no better or worse than any other OEM maker......I suppose not to include Apple.
If you go around the web you will find a 1000 post bitching about Dell.
Why is that?......................Dell sells a gazillion machines.
I'm looking at a couple of year old Dell desktop.......works fine.
