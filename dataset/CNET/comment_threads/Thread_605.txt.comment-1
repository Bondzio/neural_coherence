Hello, I am planning a new itx-build computer and I'm a bit unsure as to a video card.
Ideally, I would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the HDMI port.
Would most video cards with an HDMI port be capable of sound output, or would I need to look for a special feature on the card?
(Also, I have no real plans on gaming on it.
The most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing Blu-ray on it.
If I can find a slim blu-ray drive.)
Here is the case and motherboard I am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation.
