So far it's served me well. Take a look at the linke below...lots to choose from. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Submit=ENE&N=2010170522+1309421175&Subcategory=522&description=&srchInDesc=&minPrice=&maxPrice= The Patriot Extreme Performance 4GB Flash Drive (USB2.0 Portable) Model PEF4G200USB looks interesting too. Fast, lifetime warranty, lanyard (hard to see what it looks like), no extension cable. Let us know what you decide on and how you like it. VAPCMD

It's not only fungible but a commodity item	You would find similar results in comparing regular gas for your car. Outside of cosmetic appearances, write protect switch and maybe some bundled software there isn't much to compare here. I will write that I own a pair of 1G USB drives and they are nice to have about. By year end I'll see about getting a 4GB model but until then I picked up a 60GB small drive for same price as the 4GB flash unit. Bob
