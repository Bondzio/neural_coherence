<s> Hello, and thanks in advance for your time. </s>
<s> I'm running a Dell Latitude E6500, and ever since I pulled it out of the box a few days ago, the disk drive will not recognize new disks. </s>
<s> If an audio CD is in the drive, and I switch it to a data CD, it will not change the icon or name of the disk in the drive. </s>
<s> For example, if CD A is in the drive on boot, and ten minutes later I replace it with CD B, when I open Computer I still see the information for CD A instead of the information for CD B. </s>
<s> When I hit &quot;explore&quot;, however, I see CD B's data. </s>
<s> Even after I have done this, CD A's information remains displayed. </s>
<s> I run Windows Vista Ultimate, and the drive is an &quot;HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GSA-U20N&quot;. </s>
<s> I already checked for driver updates, loose contacts, and autoplay issues. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated, and as you can see, this is my first post on these forums, so if I left out any necessary information, let me know and I should get back to the thread within a short time. </s>
<s> I would reseat the connections at both ends, several times. </s>
<s> Verify that any addressing jumper is present or is proper. </s>
<s> Why, did you pull the drive in the 1st place, to access something or replace it, etc? </s>
<s> Did you use proper &quot;static&quot; handling? </s>
<s> If not, then you now have the result from improper handling. </s>
<s> If this is SATA type connection, these can be awful when reconnecting as it is possible to break or spread the contacts from touching 100%. </s>
<s> Verify all this and come back with results. </s>

<s> The Latitude is a laptop, it shipped with this issue, so static is out. </s>
<s> But yes, I own an antistatic mat and wrist strap and utilize both when working with internal components (I've been called paranoid). </s>
<s> And I did not remove the drive &quot;in the first place&quot;, I did it in response to this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I pulled and reseated the drive in order to (potentially) solve this problem, which arose before I did so. </s>
<s> That's better. </s>
<s> If this is a new laptop, use the warranty. </s>
<s> However, you may have voided the warranty, depends. </s>
<s> if this is used and can return it as it wasn't stated having that problem, if possible. </s>
<s> Because, this is a laptop, a repair from a proper shop maybe the only cure. </s>
<s> Other than a HD swap, could you begin suspect something else. </s>
<s> Your options become very limited as user repair. </s>
<s> I have laptop adapter/kit to see if the HD works elsewhere. </s>
<s> You can use USB ext. </s>
<s> case as well to check out HD. </s>
