bob, while i have built my own in the distant past, i moved to pre-built for the convenience and online support.
i expected to be able to order a new operating system if it was available and if i felt that i needed it.
it just surprised the heck out of me that hp would have a new operating system and not promote it to all their users, it wasn't as if they were offering this for free, there was a charge.
i'm not sure i agree with you that this is commonplace, most of my previous laptops have not needed special versions of the os, which is the cause of this problem wih my desktop.
if you believe it is commonplace, i guess based on your experience, please warn those using these pages on which systems contain exclusive versions of the operating system that can cause this.
so i stand behind my advice, watch out for hp media centers that run off hp exclusive operating systems.
