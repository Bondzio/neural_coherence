i just bought an hd tv and i found this on line at the apc web site.
it has a mountable wall bracket, 12 outlets, 3400 joules surge rating, noise filtering, rj-11 modem/fax protection (two wire single line),rj45 10/100 base-t ethernet protection,cable modem / video protection,co-axial video / cable protection, etc.
it's on sale at $99 at apc.
i mounted the unit to the back of the cabinet but it an be mounted to the wall too.
the mounting bracket allows you to mount the unit in a number of configurations.
