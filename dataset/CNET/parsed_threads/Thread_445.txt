<s> i want to build a computer.can someone let me know a good source to buy everything?or is it better to buy each item from different places on each peice of hardware? </s>
<s> thanks,edward </s>
<s> First, we will assume you've done your homework, have decided on which components to buy, and are just looking for the best way to buy. </s>
<s> Way 1): Log in to pricewatch.com amd get the lowest price period for that item. </s>
<s> Make sure, however, that you are really getting the model you want. </s>
<s> Lots of vendors substitute keywords and letters that mean a lot...an SE isn't an XT, etc. </s>
<s> Double check before ordering. </s>
<s> Most items will be OEM or bare (bare HDD's actually have a longer warranty thean retail box!) </s>
<s> there's nothing wrong with that, they will come w/ drivers. </s>
<s> Always get a mobo in retail box. </s>
<s> Lowest price is your winner, but trust your gut. </s>
<s> This way is the most fun, as pieces trickle in from all over and you do pay bottom dollar. </s>
<s> TIP: One place to NOT scrimp is RAM, unless you're just building a number-cruncher. </s>
<s> For power users, there really will be a difference, stick with Brand names like Corsiar, Crucial or Kingston. </s>
<s> 1GB is minimum, (2)-512MB has a lower latency than (1)-1GB stick. </s>
<s> Way 2): Buy everything in one place, like newegg.com. </s>
<s> This is the way I'm headed more & more, as the slight cost difference is worth the convenience. </s>
<s> There's a few things they don't carry, and I've had to go elsewhere for pieces, but I usually give these guys the meat of ny order. </s>
<s> Really easy checkout too. </s>
<s> Good luck & email me if you have any problems or questions! </s>

<s> I've never bought stuff from online, but Ihear Newegg is pretty good THeres this store called NCIX (I think it's located in Canada though) that is also pretty good. </s>
<s> i bought the vase majority of my current builds parts from them and had no problems whatsoever. </s>
<s> delivery time was extremely quick too. </s>
<s> i ordered a few flash drives first to test them out and since i used the budget shipping i figured it'd be a week or 2 before stuff showed up. </s>
<s> i think it was 5 days later i got home from class and they had arrived so they are very quick when it comes to getting stuff to you. </s>
<s> THANKS for the replies!! </s>
<s> i am going to check out the newegg. </s>
<s> Edward </s>
<s> the fedex shipping is almost unbelievably good. </s>
<s> I always get the item one day before the date in the original fedex tracking info. </s>
<s> Many other places give a low price and steal from you with the shipping cost. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Newegg has an &quot;expedited shipping&quot; for $2.99 that's for suckers only, I've NEVER used that and still get my parts within 3-4 days. </s>
<s> I don't see how they could do it faster, unless they do them in their sleep! </s>
<s> Always choose the least-expensive shipping method, unless it's an emergency. </s>
<s> Newegg is good for SOME parts, but I've found their shipping a little pricier than ChiefValue. </s>
<s> Both are EXCELLENT, however. </s>
<s> Everything I've ordered from them (RAM, speakers, video card, etc.) </s>
<s> has arrived at least 1 day earlier than the FedEx expected delivery date. </s>
<s> Tip: Newegg is cheaper on sound cards at the lower end, but ChiefValue is cheaper on the higher end ones (and usually they have free FedEx shipping!) </s>
<s> Also, compare them, since they seem to be in direct competition with one another. </s>
<s> (Some mornings one will have a monitor on sale and when I check the other, the exact monitor is also on sale!) </s>
<s> RAM is usually cheaper at ChiefValue and Video cards, I've found, are less expensive at Newegg. </s>
<s> Like another poster stated, if you're looking at pricewatch.com, pay CLOSE attention - I've noticed some model numbers advertised aren't the same ones when you visit the seller's web site. </s>
<s> Good luck and have fun! </s>
<s> Graham </s>
<s> Well, I agree that NewEgg has pretty good deals, but I would avoid ChiefValue! </s>
<s> I ordered a monitor from them last month and received an email receipt for a much higher price than what was advertised. </s>
<s> I told them to either cancel the order or charge the advertised price. </s>
<s> They told me that they could change their prices whenever they want, and they ignored my request to cancel the order. </s>
<s> Since then they've somehow disappeared and not responded to any of my emails. </s>
<s> ...about ChiefValue. </s>
<s> I've never had a problem, but I'll pay close attention when ordering (like I always do) based on your comments. </s>
<s> Ciao, Graham </s>
<s> You have received some good advice, and practically everyone (including me) in these forums who have had dealings with Newegg have good results. </s>
<s> I have read some time back of only one slight complaint, and that was them charging a 'restocking fee' on a certain item, but just about everyone charges a 'restocking fee' on certain returned items. </s>
<s> About buying ''OEM''. </s>
<s> There may be a longer warranty on certain OEM hard drives, but I always advise people who are new at buying mail order, installing parts, and not familiar with OEM parts to buy ''RETAIL'' boxed. </s>
<s> When you see something that is indicated as ''White Box'' or ''Bulk'' it is normally ''OEM''. </s>
<s> OEM (original equipment manufacture) parts may be made for a specific computer company like Dell, HP, Emachine, and others that may have given specific paramenters/specifications of what they want in the items construction, or the OEM may have cut corners in selling the OEM bulk parts. </s>
<s> The OEM factory that actually makes the part may advertise their product commercially and sell it as ''RETAIL'', while making and selling an OEM version to a factory (or distributor getting ahold of OEM) that is not exactly like the 'Retail'. </s>
<s> Also, on OEM versions you may not get instructions or manuals as the factory receiving the OEM item already knows and don't need. </s>
<s> I recall ordering a computer around 6 years ago from Dell that advertised a certain Voodoo Video Card with certain features. </s>
<s> When the PC arrived, the Voodoo Video Card was the right one ordered but didn't have the feature that was advertised by the Voodoo manufacturer, or Dell. </s>
<s> I telephone Voodoo and finally talked to a engineer who told me that the particular OEM card that they shipped to Dell didn't have the feature that they advertise on their Retail card. </s>
<s> Telephoning Dell and finally reaching a buyer representative of Dell parts (you could do that in those days), he was totally unaware that the particular OEM Voodoo Card lacked the advertised feature. </s>
<s> Well, Dell almost immediately modified their Voodoo advertisements. </s>
<s> They sent a truck out to my house and picked up my computer as they couldn't give me the video card features I wanted. </s>
<s> I received a full $$ refund and no charge for shipping/handling either way (they charged in those days). </s>
<s> When consumer VHS/Betamax cassette video recorders and camcorders came out is when I first heard about OEM, White Box, Bulk, vs Retail. </s>
<s> Some mail order stores were selling them as OEM, White Box, Bulk, and when customers received them they were Japanese packed with instructions/manuals in Japanese and the units were set with switchable non US electricity and 50 cycle. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You will find that newegg seams to be the winner most of the time. </s>
<s> I have used tirgerdirect and Fry's outpost and computer gate, but I start with newwgg. </s>
<s> Have you ever built one before??? </s>
<s> If not repost and I'll post some links that will be helpfull. </s>
