1.1.1	I have a Samsung flatCRT monitor and occasionally I 'll see orange lines going across the right side of the monitor .	St
1.1.2	After about 15 seconds all the lines disappear .	St
1.1.3	What 's going on here ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Sounds like your tube is on the fritz -- time to get a new monitor .	St
1.2.2	Could be your video card -- have you been able to test it the monitor on another computer ?	Ques
1.2.3	DESCRIBE SYMPTOMS : - Color ?	Ques
1.2.4	( Deep orange , kind of faded , light rainbow ) - Organized ?	Ques
1.2.5	( straight lines , constant width/size ) ?	Ques
1.2.6	- Disorganized ?	Ques
1.2.7	( random dots , segments , waves ) ?	Ques
1.2.8	- Traveling ?	Ques
1.2.9	( moving from where to where ) ?	Ques
1.2.10	If it 's a light rainbow , it could be a magnetic field from an electronic device deflecting electrons from the cathode ray gun ( unshielded speakers commonly cause this ) .	St
1.2.11	However , there needs to be a dynamic magnetic field for this to occur intermittently , i.e. , speaker power needs to be changing or speakers need to be moving .	St
1.3.1	I suppose a dark orange , but not too dark .	St
1.3.2	They are straight lines that go from the farmost right side to about half way .	St
1.3.3	I seem to notice them better when I open a window with a white background on the desktop .	St
1.3.4	I just bought the monitor about half a year ago .	St
1.3.5	I have an ATI Radeon 9600XT video card .	St
1.3.6	I just downloaded the latest Catalyst drivers .	St
1.3.7	I have n't changed any settings besides the TV out configuration .	St
1.3.8	Are there any changes I can make to fix the problem ?	Ques
1.3.9	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I 'm using Firefox web browser I noticed there 's an orange line across the folder tab .	St
1.4.2	I 'm not sure if it 's always been there but that 's the same orange color I see going across the screen sometimes .	St
1.4.3	Also I see the orange when I open My Computer and hover over & quot ; name & quot ; & quot ; type & quot ; & quot ; total size & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	I do n't know if that 's supposed to happen but that 's what I see .	St
1.5.1	Hmmm ... it would be very informative to see if this phenomenon were repeated while connected to a different computer , then you could confidently rule out your computer .	St
1.5.2	The good thing is that the Samsung monitors I have seen have a 3 year warranty .	St
1.5.3	I 'd check into it .	St
1.5.4	A shot in the dark : 1 .	St
1.5.5	Check monitor cable for kinks , frays , loose at jack or base of monitor .	St
1.5.6	2 .	St
1.5.7	Check to see if there are any ATI card diagnostics in Catalyst or downloadable from mfg .	St
1.6.1	Seems like that orange underlining in My Computer is standard on XP .	St
1.6.2	Same with Firefox .	St
1.6.3	So must be the monitor ?	Ques
1.6.4	But how , it 's pretty new !	St
1.7.1	Just to clarify ... Are you saying that the orange lines appear on the monitor when connected to computer one and to computer two ?	Ques
1.7.2	If the orange appears while attached to each computer it is either the monitor 's hardware or you need to install the latest driver from Samsung.com .	St
1.7.3	Try installing the latest driver .	St
1.8.1	At no particular time .	St
1.8.2	I 'll try installing the latest drivers then .	Sug
