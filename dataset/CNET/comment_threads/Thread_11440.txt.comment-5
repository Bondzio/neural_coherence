I don't know where you're at, but if within the billing period of a creditr card and you feel slighted, you can use the recourse and return the system.
After all, they give no support and how can you use it for the long term if you can't get vendor/OEM updates.
Do this NOW!
If you had this for a while, then google for PB support websites that are more friendly in providing some details on support and thier own files/pgms.
etc.. Further, make sure that some info isn't provided on a resource CD of some kind, but you have to print it out.
Check that.
