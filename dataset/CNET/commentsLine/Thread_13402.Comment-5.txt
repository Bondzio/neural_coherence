the external case was cheap and i got no customer service from the place i got it.
the manufacturer shouldn't make a difference.
the bottom line is, i thought this was just a simple computer cable that connects a hard drive to the pc power source... the smaller end connects to the pc and the larger end connects to the drive.
these appear in every external case and also in the computer, so they must be standard.
the y cables you mentioned wouldn't work, because all they are is extension cables if you want to add a second drive, and the single end is just a male power extension cable, it doesn't have the mini-4-pin end.
does anyone else have any suggestions on where to find this cable?
