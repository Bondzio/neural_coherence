The Acer's are very reliable - i have a desktop and laptop.
My desktop is around 2 yrs old now and I had only one problem with it, which technical support easily solved.
That is the big selling point - their after sales service is excellent, which is why I will be buying an acer when I upgrade.
My laptop was bought 2nd hand, out of warranty, and when i had a problem with the cursor i contacted technical support and they solved the problem for free.
An excellent range of computers too.
