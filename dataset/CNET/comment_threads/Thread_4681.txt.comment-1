My comp is not a gaming rig, not even close to being one.
I can still play some games but at a slow framerate pase.
What I want to know is.
When you lower the resolution in the game, it shows improvement in every aspect except picture quality, but on mine if I lower the resolution in windows and the game is shows dramatic improvement.
Is this just a thing in my head or does this happen in everyone elses comps?
When computers get tested for benchemarks Frame Rates do they do this or what?
