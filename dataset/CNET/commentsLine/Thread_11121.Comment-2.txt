but i'm not sure it's going to be suitable for you.
it is a &quot;non-english&quot; web site.
when i googled teac ox1200 mouse i found a lot of non-english web sites, mainly russian, but also some israeli.
i also found a lot of other sites which my browser security add-on wot, (web of trust), told me were suspect.
i used google {translate} to translate an israeli web site and found this;  shorter version of that link, zap.co.il .
that site seems to have these mouses for sale.
