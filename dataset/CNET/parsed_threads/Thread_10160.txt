<s> I need some help on partitioning and installing XP operating System on a secondary hard drive , from a primary drive the has Windows 98 SE installed. </s>
<s> I can't see the drive in the BIOS at all. </s>
<s> I have replaced the primary operating system and she is booing, after trying to install the second hard drive on the same cable as slave. </s>
<s> I tried the hard drive on the secondary C.D. </s>
<s> drive as well. </s>
<s> I get the same A:please replace a disk, error.With the 98 start up and I have even tried the XP Automated Recovery Disk.. No Joy:( I have a Gateway that is running 700 mhz cpu and 256 mg memory. </s>
<s> I hooked the secondary adaptor from the hard drive to the second hard drive and did the same with the c.d. </s>
<s> rom drive... </s>
<s> I can't boot from the floppy or c.d. </s>
<s> rom drive. </s>
<s> I appreciate the help, Laraine </s>
<s> I am so sorry for the above message. </s>
<s> I was in a terrible fix when I wrote it last night. </s>
<s> I can hardly make heads or tails out of it myself this morning. </s>
<s> What it comes down to is the fact that I can't get a second hard drive bootable. </s>
<s> I have tried to install it on the second hard drive cable as well as the second c.d. </s>
<s> rom cable. </s>
<s> Jumpered as slave. </s>
<s> I can't get the hard drive to recognize in the bios to install the operating system. </s>
<s> I can use all of the help that I can get. </s>
<s> Thanks for the patience and help, Laraine </s>
<s> How about jumpering the drive as Master and seeing if you can get it recognized by itself. </s>
<s> Check out how the first hard drive or CD is jumpered, in some cases they use CS instead of Master and in that case both drives should be jumpered CS. </s>
<s> Hey thanks for the suggestion. </s>
<s> I am at work now and I was thinking of the same thing myself. </s>
<s> My biggest problem is the fact that I can't get the cmos to recognize the drive. </s>
<s> I am installing Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> Can I use a Windows 98 SE start up disk to fdisk the drive after I get the drive recognized? </s>
<s> Or will the cd rom be automatically recognized to fdisk the drive. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help. </s>
<s> Laraine </s>
<s> well your post is kind of confusing. </s>
<s> are you saying you can't boot from the floppy? </s>
<s> that is a separate issue. </s>
<s> re: hard drive, it is possible that your BIOS needs to be flashed/updated in order to recognize the new drive. </s>
<s> re-check your cables make sure they're inserted the right way. </s>
<s> it is easy to reverse them. </s>
<s> tell us the size of the new drive --fj </s>
<s> Hey the new hard drive is 40 gb. </s>
<s> I am really just needing to put the hard drive in my Gateway computer with a 700 mhz cpu and 256 mb memory to install the operating system for a friend. </s>
<s> I am at work now, but I am getting ready to go home to work on the drive. </s>
<s> I am going to master the drive and try to install the operating system that way. </s>
<s> I do need to know if the Windows XP Home disk has fdisk on it. </s>
<s> Thanks again Laraine </s>
<s> I want to thank you all for the help. </s>
<s> I come home from work, set the hard drive up as master and I am now in the process of installing Windows XP. </s>
<s> I hate it when someone drops things in my lap. </s>
<s> I just had to do some thinking. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help, Laraine </s>
