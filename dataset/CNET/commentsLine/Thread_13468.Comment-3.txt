the intel motherboard (p965 express chipset) which i plan to buy comes with the following notice: &quot;notice: only ddr2-800 memory supporting jedec approved 1.8v operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on intel desktop boards based on intel 965 express chipsets.&quot; (click on spec tab in  ) the dual channel package rams (case 2) i found have 2.2v, 4-4-4-12 latency and cost about $70.
since i could not find dual channel ram packs with 1.8v and 5-5-5-12 latency, i was thinking of buying two individual identical rams which would meet the motherboard requirements.
the two rams cost higher - about $97 ($48.5 apiece) i am afraid of using the dual channel rams since they require about 2.2v for their operation (atleast, that is what i think so) whereas the motherboard would power them up only till 1.8v.
if you think the dual channel rams would still work fine, then i would be more than happy to go for them at $70.
