<s> Hello, I have a home network with 2 computers. </s>
<s> On one machine is a DVD-ROM and I marked the drive as shared. </s>
<s> But I still cannot access the ROM on the other machine. </s>
<s> The shared drive is visible, but when I try to access it, it says, that \\othercomp\cd-dvd is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have the permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> Like I said, I marked the drive as shared. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Regards, Mirza </s>
<s> Mirza, if you're running XP Pro you might also want to check local security settings. </s>
<s> Type secpol.msc in the run dialog box. </s>
<s> In the left pane click Security Options and locate Devices:Restrict CD Rom... in the right pane. </s>
<s> Dbl-click it and make sure it's disabled. </s>
