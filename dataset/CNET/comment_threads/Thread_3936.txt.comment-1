I have a 3 year old Dell notebook, I was wondering if there are any easy upgrades that I could make to improve performance.
I have either 256 or 512 memory, but i think only a Dell III processor at 700 or 900 MHZ.
Should I look into replacing the processor, what else can I do?
Should I look into higher video cards?
