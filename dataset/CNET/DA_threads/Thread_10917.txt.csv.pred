1.1.1	Hi All Need some input My original Gaming rig was stolen a few months ago, insurance have just coughed up the cash for a replacement, with a bit of a re jig of the finances I have approx 2000 to spend.	St
1.1.2	This is the initial build outlines, but would appreciate everyones thoughts.	St
1.1.3	Asus GeForce GTX 480 1536MB GDDR5 PCI-Express Graphics Card Corsair Dominator 6GB (3x2GB) DDR3 PC3-14400C9 (1866MHz) Tri-Channel Asus P6X58D Premium Intel X58 (Socket 1366) DDR3 Motherboard Intel Core i7 930 2.80GHz (Bloomfield) (Socket LGA1366) Corsair HX 1000W ATX Modular SLI Compliant Power Supply Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium - Fatal1ty Champion Series Antec 1200 Twelve Hundred Ultimate Gaming Case 2 x Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache LG GH22LS50 22x DVDRW SATA ReWriter Lightscribe Drive	St
1.2.1	the x-fi fatal1ty isn't worth its price tag.	St
1.2.2	it's not a bad card but for gaming it's no better than its lower priced siblings.	St
1.2.3	unless you're serious about music (192khz) or need the front panel input box, i suggest you get an x-fi titanium and upgrade to a blu-ray drive instead for the same overall price.	St
1.2.4	if 24bit 192khz is most important to you, consider an asus xonar instead (same price but better audio quality overall).	St
