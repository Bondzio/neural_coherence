i was able to do video editing with my medion 2.8ghz pc with 1gb memory, a ti4200 video card, used the onboard sound card, and had two seperate hd's.
one for software, and one for data.
it handled any game i put on it, and did the video editing just fine using adobe premiere 6.5 and sony vegas 5. to be realistic and keep you in the current ballpark, i would suggest a 3.2gh p4 with 1gb of memory, any decent video card, two seperate hd's (not a partition), and a dedicated firewire card.
do some reading at  and you will see what i'm talking about.
you could also use an athlon 3800 range pc.
the 2.8ghz will do real time video editing, but the 3.2ghz p4 is quite a bit faster.
speed costs money.
if it isn't important, than go with anything bigger than the 2.8ghz.
