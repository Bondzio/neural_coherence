this adapter i am talking about is a total network security device.
its attatched between the modem and router.
it secures the network.
my network is a desktop two laptops and a itouch.
i am wondering, if the laptops and or the itouch is used away from the s-link device, how do i run an antivirus on these portable computers.. if its possible.
i am assuming i can: disable the antivirus when i'm connected to the network, and enable the antivirus when i'm away.
is this posible,
