<s> What is the difference between Quad Core and Dual Core? </s>
<s> I would think a Pentium D Quad Core Processor would be better than an Intel Core 2 Duo but it seems like it isn't? </s>
<s> How is that? </s>
<s> quad cores have 4 cpus; dual cores have 2 cpus. </s>
<s> pentium Ds are dual core versions of the pentium 4; there is no pentium D quad core. </s>
<s> the core2 cpu is a different design than a p4 and has more compute performance at a lower clock speed. </s>
<s> so a 2ghz core2 cpu can outperform a 3ghz p4 in most applications. </s>
<s> core2 is available as dual core and quad core chips. </s>
<s> Quad Core CPUs have four physical cores, while Dual Core CPUs have two physical cores, both comprise a single CPU. </s>
<s> As has been said, Pentium D is the dual core rendition of the Pentium 4, using the Smithfield and Presler cores, while Core 2 Duo and Core 2 Quad are P6 derived and much more efficient in terms of FP performance and memory efficiency, which increases overall performance. </s>
<s> The advantage to multi-core CPUs is the ability for the CPU to do more than one thing at a time, which increases system performance (it is not 2.0x, or anywhere near 2.0x), and allows more complex calculations to be completed, which means a quad core can do more than a dual core, however this ability to do more won't usually manifest performance increases in situations where it can't be utilized (just because you have a Ferrari doesn't mean your daily drive is any shorter). </s>
