I store large numbers of RAW photo files as well as high resolution audio and video files (multi-GB) so the typical cloud solutions are either too slow or too expensive for the size of files I am shuffling around.
Maybe DVDs are on the way out for the common users.
I am rather confident they will stay around for some time for those in my situation -- and there are quite a few of us.
Its either DVDs or RAID storage and the continual replacement of RAID drives makes that a less than ideal solution.
The M-Disc solution seems to get around the finite nature of HD (regardless of whether it is solid state or rotational) life.
Given the physics of what Milllenniata is doing -- and while I'm not a physics prof, what they are doing is physically possible -- their solution has distinct possibilities.
So has any one used M-Discs and what has been your experience with them?
