1.1.1	A friend has a laptop and wants me to add an external HDD ( via USB ) to it .	St
1.1.2	It 's a relatively old system ( 166 mgz ) running Win98 .	St
1.1.3	48 megs of Ram My question is what would be the limit of hard drive this system could detect .	St
1.1.4	He 's looking at buying a 6 Gig drive .	St
1.1.5	Is there a general rule of thumb to determine this systems ' HD limit or would I need to provide more info ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	133Gb would probably be the BIOS limit , but that can normally be overcome .	St
1.2.2	The laptop probably supports USB 1.0 so speed might be an issue with an external drive and possibly power via the USB .	St
1.2.3	6Gb is quite small these days and will not be an issue , more likely whether the enclosure for it supports an external power source .	St
1.2.4	However it may not be an issue .	St
1.2.5	Hard drives and enclosures are quite cheap in the 20Gb range .	St
1.2.6	Look on E-Bay for a 9mm / 2.5 & quot ; IDE drive and also for an enclosure .	St
1.2.7	Both can be had under $ 50.00 .	St
1.2.8	You can get close to 6Gb on a USB flash stick these days ( 4GB ) .	St
1.3.1	You 'll know because the BIOS will & quot ; hang & quot ; when you put something over that on it .	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks gentlemen .	St
1.4.2	Much appreciated .	Polite
1.4.3	Z	St
1.5.1	Unless he has 98 second edition with a patch flash would be a bad investment .	St
