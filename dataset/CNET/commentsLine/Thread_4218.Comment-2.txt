i highly suggest you actually go to a store, bring your power supply with you and see which one is exactly like yours.
i had to replace my aging psu, bought one from the internet and guess what it didn't fit.
i brought my psu to my compusa and i got the right psu.
remember size and desgin matters ^^.
