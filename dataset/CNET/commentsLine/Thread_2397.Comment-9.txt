kaecourt: you are the genius.
thanks: i followed your advice and &quot;extracted out the &quot;wiafbdrv.dll file from c;\windows\driver cache\1386\driver.cab&quot; and moved it to the visioneer folder.
lo and behold.
success!
up to this pont i was only able to get paper port on the screen, but not able to &quot;connect the scanneer&quot;.
now e are all happy.
thanks, richard
