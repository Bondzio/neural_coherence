1.1.1	Hello , Animations and rendered stills - which is a great desktop ?	Ques
1.1.2	I am a 3rd year achitecture student that is keen in rendering .	St
1.1.3	Right now my college has some pretty bad desktops , low performance and reliability issues , and I am using my macbook pro : ( 2.53gh core 2 duo , 512mb nvidia 9600GTM , 4gb 1067mhz ddr3 RAM ) to do the renders .	St
1.1.4	I find it really is more reliable than the school computers , but is still slow and running windows on bootcamp is so risky , so I am intersted in buying a desktop and was wondering which you would recommend .	St
1.1.5	If you are an architecture student out there you will know that next year is my year of placement ( work ) so will not be needing it as much then , so it may not be worth it seeming as in 2 years there will be another awesome machine .	St
1.1.6	Please architecture or non-architecture student help is all welcome .	St
1.2.1	You have the school machines , your machine and only need to get by till then .	St
1.2.2	Also there is a big change brewing in the PC/Mac world so my advice today is to put more rubberbands around your wallet .	St
