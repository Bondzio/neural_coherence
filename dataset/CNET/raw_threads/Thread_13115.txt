I recently installed (after formating HDD) on one of my computers (comp C) Windowx XP Media Center (Windows XP Home Edition was previous operating system). Other two computer (comp A&B) are running on Widows XP Profesional. My Problem: I am not able to acess comp C neither from comp A nor com B. While the comp C is listed in my worgroup computers. When I click on comp C the error message comes up: \\comp C is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrato of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The network path was not found. Please help me to figure this out. Thanks for your time and all your help. blaze79

Also, are you certain that the Workgroup name is the same on all 3 computers?
