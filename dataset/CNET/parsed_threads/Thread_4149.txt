<s> okay, here's my puzzlement: I had a soyo 6BA+III mobo sitting around, had a bad EIDE socket. </s>
<s> I saw another 6BA+III board on ebay with a bad bios flash, so i bought it cheap. </s>
<s> it says 6BA+III on the board, altho it looks somewhat different . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> anyway, I put my old, good 6BA+III BIOS chip in the newly purchased board and it booted up, but oh man, is it slow -- like an LX board. </s>
<s> takes a good 5-8 seconds to check the 64 KB of memory. </s>
<s> Also a 650 mhz slot one CPU is only seen as 400 mhz. </s>
<s> (this board is rated for 850 mhz) so, is this an LX board incorrectly (or fraudulently) marked as the 6BA+III ? </s>
<s> or is the swapped BIOS chip causing this speed limitation somehow? </s>
<s> was only 3 bucks on ebay-- fj </s>
<s> Did you update the BIOS to latest? </s>
<s> If not, why not? </s>
<s> Hint: I do this all the time and never lost a board. </s>
<s> Must be some thousands by now... Bob </s>
<s> well there are 3 reasons I didn't update the bios, 1) I was not totally convinced that this BIOS chip is the right one for this board, even tho it worked 2) the previously owner had a meltdown after doing a flash 3) it is acting so strange, i.e., running like a much older slower board, the speed of the mobo should be what it is, even with an old BIOS, yes? </s>
<s> but i'll do it if you think I should. </s>
<s> will a BIOS update make the basic board speed faster (as seen in the memory check at startup)? </s>

<s> This has become a recurring theme. </s>
<s> People get boards and do everything but update the BIOS. </s>
<s> My losses for such stand at ZERO boards in over 10 years. </s>
<s> If I'm allowed a few &quot;saves&quot;, then I'm in the negative board losses. </s>
<s> There is a method to flash the BIOS in a HOT FLASHING method. </s>
<s> Which is how I recovered a few boards when I didn't have access to a device known as a PROM PROGRAMMER... </s>
<s> If you want to try it, here's the GOOGLE to the method. </s>

<s> that sounds like fun. </s>
<s> I'll let you know how it goes! </s>
