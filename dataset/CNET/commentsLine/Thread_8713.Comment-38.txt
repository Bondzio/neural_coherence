i sucked up two keyboard keys with a vacuum about a week ago!
my vacuum cleaner is installed into the house so maybe because it was too powerful?
my keyboard is fairly strong so i don't think its that.
the keys i sucked up are screen lock and print screen, luckily i don't use these that often and they were from my secondary keyboard.
if i was to do it again i would put on the corner nozzle which is not big enough to let keys in.
