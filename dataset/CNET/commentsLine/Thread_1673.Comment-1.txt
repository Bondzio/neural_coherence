ok so this is a long story however, i will make it as short as possible for the sake of the forum.... i've set up a vpn connection from a doc's office to a satalite office... first using a netgear fvs318 at one end to a fvs114 at the other... nothing but problems...the vpn connection would intermittently drop out for no apparent reason... one end uses a cable internet and the other uses a partial t1... so we narrows it dow the the fvs318 being old and dropping the connection...so we've changed it to using 2 fvs114's it works and just fine...however, the doc also wants to be able to vpn from his house... the problem is that when we setup any other vpn's from the main office the additional connection will connect but you cannot access anything on the remote lan... which defeates the point of a vpn... any suggestions on solving this problem... or is that netgear routers just can't handle simotanious vpn's as advertised?
thanks for any suggestions in advance
