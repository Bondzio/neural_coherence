won't start or are you saying when you connect the hdd to the ide cable it won't start ?
for what it's worth i have seen situations where connecting a hdd caused the system to appear dead and wouldn't start.
once the the drive was disconnected, the system it would start immediately.
or does the problem start when you comnnect the power to (one of) the drives ?
if the ide controller is damaged or shorting out somewhere...you could add a secondary controller for the ide drives.
