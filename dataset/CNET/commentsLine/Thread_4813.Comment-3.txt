sounds like he has the reverse problem.
he wants the remote machine to use his proxy for dns lookup rather that attempt to do it themselves.
most the settings related to bypass proxy are for when you have internal servers you can get to directly.
this is mostly to reduce the load on the proxy.
it will do little good to set the host setting on each machine.
they do not look in the host file or even query the dns.
when you set the bypass proxy stuff it will then do its own dns query and go directly... ie bypass your proxy.
when you use proxy you want to make it so all the other machine must pass though the proxy to get to the internet.
now assuming you force all the traffic though the proxy and the proxy is not using your host file this is a issue with the proxy software.
you would think the proxy would just make a call to the os to look up the names and the os would use the host file.
i would spend my time looking for a setting on the proxy that would cause it to bypass the host file.
also make sure that the proxy machine honors the host file when you access things directly.
if all else fails you could try to use opendns rather than the host file to filter stuff... there is a small charge for the version that you can add things to
