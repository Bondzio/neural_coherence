Hi, I am planning on building a gaming PC with Core i7.
I have build my system back in the days on Pentium4 but never with current generation processors.
I have a basic idea but nervous with some aspects.
1.
Does a core i7 (940 or 965 extreme) need an aftermarket giant cooler unless I overclock it?
2.
Do I need to apply a thermal paste for these processors or can it be safe without it as well?
Thank you.
