I have a typcal cable modem with a Belkin pre N wireless router, a main desktop, another desktop, both wired, two laptops linked wirelessly, and two identical desktops linked wirelessley.
I cannot get one of the wireless desktops to pick up an IP address.
I get the default address and the limitied connectivity warning when trying to connect.
I have switched everything between the two pcs with the same result (endlessly).
I have the MAC address specified in the router, auto IP config and WPA set.
There is no firewall on the pc atthe moment.
Out of patience!!
Any thoughts?
?
