good choice of going for amd.
absolutely true that they currently have intel beaten.
remains to be seen though, when intel do finally release their 64 bit line in the coming months(which they happened to copy from amd).
the msi board looks ok, although personally, i have always prefered giga-byte or asus for my systems.
gigabyte do have quite a good lineup out now for the nforce4 chipset, if you haven't checked them out already.
the cpu's that you are talking about using in this system though (3400+, 3700+), are 754pin socket processors.
the msi and any other current board for the athlon64 line uses the 939pin socket.
754 is now for slower sempron cpu's.
the nforce4 is a 939 only chipset.
a good retailer should spot this when you purchase it though and correct you, if you're lucky.
imho, i think the 3500+ cpu is the best value for money cpu to get, unless you are going to upgrade this component later, then you could save some cash and get the 3200+.
the performance increase is certainly worth the extra amount though on the higher model processor.
happy system building.
