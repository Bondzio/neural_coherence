<s> When I tried to defragment it said check disc for errors.I did that it said there were none.I tried again it goes to 1% complete and and starts again.When I tried to check for errors again it just keeps restarting and I get the message that it started ten times do I want to keep receiving this message.I don't know a whole lot about all off this,but I do know my computer hasn't been running right for a while.That's why I thought using the system tools would help.PLEASE HELP,HELP,HELP!!! </s>

<s> Outside of suggesting the use of a better program than what the system came with and the Safe Mode suggestion, you should check MSCONFIG (not included in Win2000 but can be added from XP versions) to see what Processes are possibly still running on the computer (and hense why safe mode is a better mode to do these types of functions). </s>
<s> I'd have to say that there is a program running that interfers with the defrag process. </s>
<s> I do turn off the screen saver I forgot to mention that.What does it mean to be in safe mode?When I turned the computer on it said it was starting up in the safe mode.Any other suggestions.Thanks! </s>
<s> I have to agree with you something is running even when I close everything thats in my toolbar.I don't remember what to do when I go into MSCONFIG.Can you help?Thanks! </s>
<s> The message says it is starting in selective startup not safe mode.I assume I am in safe mode but how would I know?Help!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> I would select the option selective startup and uncheck the Load startup group items. </s>
<s> If the xp (and it will work in 2000) version of Msconfig has and Advanced tab, select that and place a check mark in Enable Startup Menu. </s>
<s> This will bring up a menu before booting into Windows allowing you to select normal mode (windows) or Safe Mode, etc. </s>
<s> If this function is not an option on the XP version don't worry about it. </s>
<s> That should take care of just about all the back ground programs running. </s>
<s> Do not forget to place Msconfig back to Normal mode before going on the internet as you will have turned off any anti virus and spyware protection while in the Selective startup mode. </s>
<s> Try that and reply back to us here. </s>

<s> tap F8 and you will get a screen says pck see will say safe click that and when comp boots will say safe mode in all 4 corners your graphics will be lousey np. </s>
