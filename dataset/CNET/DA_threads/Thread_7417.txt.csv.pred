1.1.1	My machine (HP 9340, Vista 64-bit, home premium) has one empty PCI slot.	St
1.1.2	I have several external drives that have both a USB and eSATA input connector.	St
1.1.3	I've seen eSATA PCI cards with 4 eSATA ports.	St
1.1.4	Will I see better performance on transfer speeds between drives and the computer, if I install such a card?	St
1.1.5	That is, with all four ports connected to drives, and running?	St
1.1.6	Thanks.	St
1.1.7	Al	St
1.2.1	but saddled on the pci bus, i doubt you will see much (if any) improvement especially since most pci-sata cards use controllers that perform rather poorly.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	be better of using something like http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812206003 No PCI card needed if you have unused SATA connectors on the MB.	St
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I looked inside the box, and with the other drives hooked to the MB, I've only got one free socket left.	St
1.6.2	If I put a 1 port eSATA to this, would a 1-in, 5-out eSATA hub work to give me more outlets and still provide the faster transfer speeds?	St
1.6.3	Something like this: http://www.cooldrives.com/sahub5muussi.html	St
1.7.1	Before spending $100 on an eSATA HUB, I'd try it direct with the device suggested and check the results.	St
1.7.2	Next I'd look at all the alternatives to see if that's truly the best approach to my storage and backup requirements.	St
1.7.3	With the multitude of problems I see with externals ...	St
1.7.4	I much prefer to utilize internals where possible.	St
1.7.5	Keep us posted on the outcome.	St
1.7.6	VAPCMD	St
