<s> I have an old Dell 8200 with 512 mb memory with a bad hard drive. </s>
<s> I recently purchased on ebay the same model. </s>
<s> It has 512 mb memory also. </s>
<s> Can I take the 512 mb out of my computer and add it to the other computer? </s>

<s> And it says it's so old they don't currently have memory for it in stock. </s>
<s> Luckily you have yourself! </s>
