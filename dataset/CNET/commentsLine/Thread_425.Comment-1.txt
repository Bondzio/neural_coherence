the drive has been clicking for about 3 weeks now.
i've moved all files to a new drive, so no fear of losing data.
my question is, if the drive really is gonna crash, is there any way i can have it happen within the warranty period so i can have it replaced?
from my experience, all comp parts tend to fail just after passing the warranty period!
