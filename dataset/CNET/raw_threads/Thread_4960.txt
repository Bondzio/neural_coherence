Hi, I'm interested in buying either the 19&quot; or 17&quot; LG LCD Monitor on page 17, of todays Best Buy circular. Model #L1933TR-SF or L1733TR-SF. Prices are $229 and $199 respectfully. I cannot find a review of these monitors, and they don't seem to be listed on the LG web site. Are they too old or too new to be listed? Both monitors have the same specs(only the size differs). I was once told that 19&quot;s are 'grainy' compared to 17&quot; models. They both have the same screen resolution also(if that matters). Any advice as to which one to get, or are they bad monitors. Thanks, Tom.

While I could not find a review of either display, I did find product page for the 19&quot; model on their Canadian website... click here . It is also primarily sold in Canadian stores, though Best Buy is debuting it here in the states. The 17&quot; is from the same product line, so the information likely holds true for it as well. Aside from that, I can tell you that they are both new models, with product pages being created about a month ago, and both have been certified to handle Windows Vista. Thus, it may be a little while before full reviews and users opinions are available. Overall LG tends to hover around a 6/10 when it comes to LCD monitors and televisions reviewed by the Cnet editors. One thing you may consider doing is visiting a local Best buy or other electronics store and viewing it for yourself...the sales associates usually have display models they can plug in for you to look at. I haven't noticed a drop in quality with 19&quot; LCDs, but if there is you'll be able to spot it before you buy. Hope this helps, John

Black color is really black!!! LCD backlight is perfectly even. After I adjusted color settings, colors are almost perfect. No ghosting. At the beginning I was not sure what to buy - L1933TR or L1900R. However since I do not see difference between specifications and I do not like design of L1900R I decided to buy L1933TR. And I have no regrets I will also repeat advice from previous reply - go to store and compare quality yourself. (Only remember that default settings are not necessarily are the best...) Alex
