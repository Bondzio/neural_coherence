I'm not overly familiar with Dells, but the ones that I've had some hands-on time with opened like clam shells - there should be large, recessed, oval-shaped buttons on the top and bottom of the case.
With the case laying on it's side and facing away from you, push in those buttons and open - it opens towards you (the back), the hinges are in the front.
If your case design is different from what I've described, I'm just as lost... Good luck!
