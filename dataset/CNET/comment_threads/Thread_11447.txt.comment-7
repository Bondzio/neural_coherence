Or could you get by with an AMD 965BE quad core CPU?
I only ask because if this rig is for gaming, there aren't too many games that will utilize a hexi-core CPU.
If this is for gaming; maybe put the extra cash into an 890FX motherboard instead http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131644
