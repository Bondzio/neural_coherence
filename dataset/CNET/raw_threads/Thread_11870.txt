You claim that the PC has a telnet server but how did you configure said server to be reachable via the internet? I don't see where you put this PC in to the DMZ or tried your hand at port forwarding on the router. Bob

I can't write at length about what is a single sentence and a single router entry. If you need more about the ROUTER DMZ then you hit the usual search engine as anything I would write is there. Port forwarding is quite a bit of setup. I can't teach that here. The owner must dive in with more research as its setup varies with the router so again, it's back to the owner. They must be comfortable with doing this since they get to support it. Bob

DMZ is a snap as it's one entry and we are done as the PC is now getting all incoming requests. Port Forwarding is safer in my opinion but some owners are not network proficient so we start with the DMZ for them. Bob
