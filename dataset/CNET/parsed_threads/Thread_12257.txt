<s> Hi, I am trying to decide between 2 PSU's. </s>
<s> I don't want to have to pay more than $200 for it. </s>
<s> I have found these two PSU's. </s>
<s> The PC C&C Silencer 750 Quad ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703009 ) and the Rosewill RX950-S-B ATX ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182096 ) I can get the Rosewill for a deal with the processor I am getting (the Intel Quad Core Q6600) for $120 where as the PC C&C PSU will be $170. </s>
<s> I want to be able to use it with my Quad core and two Nvidia 8800 GT video cards using and XFX nforce 680i motherboard ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8434385&type=product&id=1182557691186&ref=09&loc=01&srccode=cii_5766179&cpncode=09-44158805-2 )which one is better in the end and will meet my requirements and I would prefer that no one just tell me that the Rosewill is better since the wattage is higher on it. </s>
<s> I also should say that I noticed that the efficiency on the PC C&C is 83% and on the Rosewill it is 75%. </s>
<s> If you could reply ASAP that would be great since I am pressed for time. </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006 about $150 after $25 rebate...5 year warranty too. </s>
<s> Already got the MB ? </s>
<s> Heard there we some issues with the 680i chipset MBs with the Q6600. </s>
<s> Maybe it's only the eVGA MB For more ref on PSU.....go to http://www.jonnyguru.com VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>
<s> That PSU looks amazing! </s>
<s> I think i will get that considering it has such high ratings. </s>
<s> Also, I looked online for conflicts between the motherboard and the processor and I could only find issues with and older version of this motherboard by the looks of it. </s>
<s> Am I incorrect? </s>
<s> Can you find me something on this if possible? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> not sure about the Q4 and the 680 MBs .... </s>
<s> I just heard/read mention of it...I'm thinking it was the eVGA version. </s>
<s> If it were me...I'd try the MB mfgs site and see if they have a forum on MBs and specifically a forum on the MB you want. </s>
<s> Usually lots of good info re user problems with their boards. </s>
<s> Another MB option worth looking at is the Abit IP35 Pro ....I've read some good tech eval ratings and 245 buyer reviews on Newegg where 83% were 5's and 11% were 4's. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> That motherboard looks good but I am wondering if I could SLI 2 Nvidia Video Cards using it? </s>
<s> Also, if possible I would like to add a physics accelerator. </s>
<s> Lastly, what does &quot;MB mfgs&quot; mean, and where is there site? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> or Crossfire support. </s>
<s> MB mfgs = motherboard manufacturers ... </s>
<s> I looked but did not see a user forum on the Abit site...bummer. </s>
<s> Asus has good user forum for posting questions about Asus products by type....such as by motherboard and model number. </s>
<s> Very good for pre purchase product review or troubleshooting. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Just double check re the Quad Core and the 680 chipset MBs. </s>
<s> Good support for Dual Core. </s>
<s> I think I will just stick with the Nvidia 680i. </s>
<s> It seems to have some pretty good review and should do just fine. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help and the PSU looks great! </s>
