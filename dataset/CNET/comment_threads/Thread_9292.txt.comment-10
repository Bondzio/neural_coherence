I have a hp960c deskjet printer 2.
I have a Nortek BT 500 bluetooth printer server 3.
I connect bluetooth printer server via USB cable to hp960c 4.
I switch on hp960c an BT 500 5.
I search the bluetooth device with 'Add bluetooth device' option on my PC (XP) 6.
The bluetooth utility found the BT 500 7.
The bluetooth utility give the code for pairing BT 500 8.
The empty code does'nt work 9.
What is the right code for BT 500?
