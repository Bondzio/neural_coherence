<s> I have a Microsoft mouse, and it does not scroll properly in itunes... its definitely not an hardware issue as i can scroll in any problem in all other applications eg. </s>
<s> Firefox, Safari... Its a Microsoft Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000. </s>
<s> Checked with a friend and his microsoft mouse also behaves this way </s>
<s> I didn't install any driver from the included CD or from anywhere else. </s>
<s> Im having the same problem with my microsoft wireless notebook mouse 4000, and I have no idea on how to solve. </s>
<s> We have to ask microsoft... </s>
<s> I beleive I have tracked it down to one of two services that iTunes installs. </s>
<s> These are IPAHelper and AppleMobileDeviceService. </s>
<s> It is one of these two causing it. </s>
<s> I have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again. </s>
<s> I just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is (since I do not need either to run, I just suspend both). </s>
<s> I do have a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the MS site (ver 6.2), so it is not the MS drivers. </s>
<s> Install intellipoint onto your machine. </s>
<s> Copy the the Microsoft Intellipoint folder from Program files to somewhere else. </s>
<s> Uninstall intellipoint. </s>
<s> Restart Find your mouse in the device manager. </s>
<s> Update the drivers with the drivers in the intellipoint folder. </s>
<s> My mouse scrolls fine now even after a restart. </s>
