&quot;Actually, I've got (almost) the same problem (it's an external USB Audigy 2 NX), and none of the things you described apply.
I know it's not a dead card, because we are getting sound from it.
And, like the guy before me, the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed.
Anybody got a clue?&quot; Let's see: A.
The card (USB box..) is &quot;getting sound from it.&quot; B.
&quot;the card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed.&quot; I have no clue what issue you are having since you didn't tell what wasn't working.
