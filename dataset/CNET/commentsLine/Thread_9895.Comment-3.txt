mtrbds.
become picky when all ram slots are used.
it really pays to have matched sets of ram and/or similar types.
while you have very similar type you don't have true matched pairs and you see the result.
if you have tweaked the ram at all, return or reduce ram demands abit in order to lessen speed, hopefully it can recover.
you can play with the setting but start at more safe level then tweak up.
further, you have the os limits and that may come into play.
then on top of that, the mtrbd.
may need a bios update, see if one is available for such a cure and &quot;what it does&quot;.
what happens when only 3 sticks are installed?
try with the new sticks alone, what happens?
