4568	0	66026	783669	NR	pubbyman	2/22/05 4:55 PM	1.1090913E12	USB Ports	Motherboard MSI K7N420. I have 3 additional USB slots on my MB. I have 2 USB ports on front of my case and D-Bracket with 2 USB and 4 LED. I had the D-Bracket connected, but the USB ports would not function and the 4 LED remained green, always, which is supposed to indicate that the Operating System is Booting. Whats wrong with the D-Bracket? How, if possible, can I use all the available USB ports?
