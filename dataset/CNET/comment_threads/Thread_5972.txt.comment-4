The Nvidia 6100 is comparable to ATI Xpress 200, both integrated graphics.
However, like the ATI chipset, there is a PCIe slot for a better graphics card.
Yes, you can play those games on it, but at the lowest settings.
I've played FEAR on the ATI Xpress 200 gpu and it wasn't very pretty.
For optimum playing you're better to upgrade with a card.
