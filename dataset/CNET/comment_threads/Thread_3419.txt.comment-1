Hi, I have connected USB disk drives to my Win XP PC in the past and worked fine.
However, having recently borrowed a 50 GB usb drive, I cannot view this in My Computer.
It is visible in device manager, in disk manager it is marked as &quot;Healthy (active)&quot; but has no volume label (also no info in the &quot;file system&quot; column).
when i right click, the only option is &quot;delete partition&quot;.
in DiskPart, the disk is visible and &quot;online&quot; but does not appear as a volume.
i have noticed that in device manager the Location is Location 0.
Not sure if this is right or not, as the C Drive location is Location 0 (0).
the disk has data on it which i need so cannot format etc, can anyone help me get access to this disk?
