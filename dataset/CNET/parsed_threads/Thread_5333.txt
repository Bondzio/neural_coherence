<s> New Mobo (with onboard sound), ram, and CPU. </s>
<s> Anyway when trying to use a microphone it whines and makes all sorts of weird noises. </s>
<s> I already tried changing mics. </s>
<s> That doesnt make a difference. </s>
<s> AMD 64 Athlon 3000+ 512MB DDR400 RAm nVidia GeForce 5900XT Realtek AC'97 onboard Sound Card </s>

<s> Sometimes when recording you can hear some interference, try muting everything except the mic and wave in the volume icon if dont know where it is its by the side of the clock or you can go start/controlpanel/sounds&devices/advanced probably can be the cd. </s>
<s> I already tried that, didnt do anything... at least anything I noticed. </s>
<s> You have onboard sound which means it's going to pick up the electrical energy the motherboard omits. </s>
<s> Try picking up a cheap sound card and see if that fixes anything(like a Sound Blaster Live). </s>
