i've been shopping around for a gaming machine for a few weeks now and i've almost settled on digital storm to build my first true gaming rig however the more i look at the benefits of building my own pc the more tempting it becomes.
there's a few things holding me back, among them are how to troubleshoot?
how to avoid compatability issues.
fear factor (bios scares me a little).
no tech support.
did i spend my money in the right places?
i have a budget of $2000-$2500 for this so i know the savings of building my own will be very significant however that warm fuzzy feeling of warranties and tech support will be gone.
i do like that i'll be getting educated as i go but fear the pain and frustration that education may cause (not to mention money) so i guess after all my rambling my question is...will that education, pain and suffering (assuming murphy's law is in full effect) end up as a rewarding and satisfactory experience or should i play it safe?
