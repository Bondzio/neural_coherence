<s> First off i got no sound? </s>
<s> i called up the guy who cleaned out my PC and put in new hardware and what not told me that its a Legacy Audio, Search up drivers for it and you will have sound... why did he not do it? </s>
<s> i have no idea So i go up on google.ca type it in go to the site and there is no tab about updating drivers. </s>
<s> I found one site that did, thing is it wants me to pay? </s>
<s> i never had to do this when i had too update my video card driver. </s>
<s> But that aint all... just wondering if i type in Audio Codecs and see what pops up. </s>
<s> I click on Update driver, once again... need to pay??? </s>
<s> Anyways before i get pissed off i have another question. </s>
<s> Dumbass didnt put in a new Graphics card instead put in my old X550 256mb which cant play anything. </s>
<s> I need one that can properly play Games such as Oblivion, The Witcher, Gothic 3 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R I am a 360 Gamer but sadly some of the games i got arent for the xbox360. </s>
<s> Would anyone know a great Graphics card that can handle those games at high quality??? </s>
<s> Needs to be under $150CAN. </s>
<s> I am still scouting around and cant find anything that will last me more then 6 months... </s>
<s> I would really appreciate it if someone can help out becouse sadly the guy who WAS! </s>
<s> suppose to update what i asked for cant seem to answer my questions properly, And i am paying this guy almost $900CAN </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Well i found out WHY! </s>
<s> i have no sound, need to get the CD for the sound card driver. </s>
<s> The guy didnt bother sending it with the Tower... Now as for graphics card, i currently have ATI RADEON X550 256mb. </s>
<s> My chipset is PCI-E, Now i am not an extreme gamer so i dont plan on playing games like Crysis but... i want something that will run the current games i have on high settings The Elder Scrolls Four: Oblivion, S.T.A.L.K.E.R and soon its expansion, Company of heroes, Gothic 3, and soon The Witcher. </s>
<s> I recently went to systemrequirementslab.com and did a scan. </s>
<s> Now i wouldent be typing in this box asking for someones opinion if i knew what the hell to get, hehe... </s>
<s> So if you would know what i can get that wont be majorly expensive! </s>
<s> I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> I also checked at all sites seeing what they recommend, But i never do trust what they have down... After 2 months it goes into the garbage </s>
<s> you've probably got integrated audio now. </s>
<s> audio cards are inexpensive, so a sound blaster audigy se ($30 at circuit city/best buy) might be worthwhile. </s>
<s> as for graphics, the x550 is pretty low-end for those games (especially stalker and witcher). </s>
