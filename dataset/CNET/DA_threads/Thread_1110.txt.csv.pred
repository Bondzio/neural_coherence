1.5.1	Select a printer that provides a & quot ; straight-through & quot ; paper feed path .	St
1.5.2	In other words , one that does n't need to bend the paper in order to print and eject the finished output .	St
1.5.3	This allows for less pinch & grab roller action and reduces jams , stuck , etc .	St
1.5.4	in t he printer .	St
1.5.5	Regardless if capable of handling 80lb .	St
1.5.6	paper , it just makes for less hassle .	St
1.5.7	While Robert provided a printer to think about , you responded in cost consensus way , remember , & quot ; cheap is cheap & quot ; and in printing the results are easily acknowledged as such .	St
1.5.8	So spend what needs to be spent or respend again to replace .	St

1.6.1	A print shop I know in Vancouver , BC never paid for such printers .	St
1.6.2	These were those monsters you know are in the 5 figure range so rather than bet the business on that they rented or leased them .	St
1.6.3	That also cured issues of repair since the lease included maintenance calls and more .	St
1.6.4	- & gt ; What this also did was make sure the printing income paid the costs of these printers .	St
1.6.5	If the market or sales did n't support such a printer they could end the lease .	St

1.7.1	Okidata C5500n finally works with 80 lbs cover .	St
1.8.1	Do you have any idea where they rented their equipment from .	St
1.8.2	This sounds like a good option , I 'm just not sure where to find a rental company .	St
