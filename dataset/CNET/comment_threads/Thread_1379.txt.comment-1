Im trying to piece together a couple of old computers for my kids to do school research on ..so here's my most recent question ...Iam working on a pc 486dx I dont know where to look for MB id...when I first turned it on ...I beeped ..no screen on monitor.. removed connections and boards to clean contacts and reseat...this chassis has a lock on the case face,it connects to MB...I dont know whats that for or how to check to see if its on or off ...I dont know if just disconnecting it will work just 2 wire connector...any way now I try to boot ...it counts mem...then goes to next screen..hard ware listing ...then below that the curser is flasing ....no letter, just curser...tried 98 boot disk ...nothing..A drive lite is on all the time even without a disc in it ...is that normal...sorry guys and gals ...I'm TRYING ta learn ....I dont know how you guys know all this ....
