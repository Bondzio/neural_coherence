<s> Hi All, Appreciate, if someone could please advise me, at what price will I be able to sell my Lenovo Ideapad S9e which I bought in June'09 for &#8364; 320.00. </s>
<s> Thanks All. </s>
<s> The best thing to do is to check the price for a comparable laptop at the usual second-hand sites in your country. </s>
<s> A three year old netbook without warranty can't be worth much. </s>
<s> If it's the cheapest one I see it has: Atom N270 processor, 512 MB, 8.9&quot; screen, 80 GB hard disk, XP Home, 3 cell battery (the original one). </s>
<s> Let's say 25 euro's. </s>
<s> Maybe 50 but not more. </s>

<s> Hi Kees, Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I had browse through and could not find any comparable lap tops in any Irish websites. </s>
<s> It has 1GB HD memory. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The model/make does not have to match to be one you are comparing. </s>
