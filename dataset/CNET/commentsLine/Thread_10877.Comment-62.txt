janitorman, i agree with greg - using an ssd for the boot drive makes a significant (not just noticeable) difference.
i build a new computer every 2 - 3 years and pass my old one to my wife (who puts less demand on them than i do).
i used a 128 gb ssd for the one i built a few months ago and it made such a difference that i installed one on my wife's &quot;old&quot; computer.
all our data goes to regular hdds.
it may well be that the difference is not particularly important to you, but there is quite a difference.
i like (really like) that word and excel open in under 2 seconds and that photoshop actions happen without delay.
i couldn't get that on my 3 year old machine, much less the one i had 10 years ago.
i also play demanding games, but i don't think the drive is as much as an issue there (as long as i have enough memory) and i relocated them to my regular hdd (using the junction command that spadeskingtx mentioned to access them without having to reinstall them).
it's a matter of what is important to you.
i use a big, expensive flat screen monitor and would never go back to my old 17&quot; lcd monitor, much less my old (huge, heavy, hot) crt.
but i drive a 13 year old pickup with a lot of miles on it and i'm happy enough with it to not spend the money for a new one.
i spend a lot more time with my computer than i do with my truck.
but i do admit that the newer ones are more comfortable, quieter and efficient than my old tacoma.
