this question gets asked by recent switchers who are used to having a web page fill the entire screen.
problem with that is that the web pages are not built to fill the whole screen.
most are built to accommodate a 19&quot; monitor.
try hitting the green button, top left of the window, and safari will expand to the actual size of the web page.
