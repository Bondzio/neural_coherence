It's the end that you would connect to the front usb port on your computer nowadays. All I've been able to find are cross usb cable or something but they are 40 bucks, and I don't even know if they are the same type. One came with my digital camera but I broke it so I could use another one. Input would be much appreciated.

Of course google some more, use cable or harnesses or adapters as keywords. Sorry, if cheap is the driving and you don't find one cheap then expect to pay for special needs cable. tada -----Willy
