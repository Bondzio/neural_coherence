i am having some issues with my samsung hd 501 jk internal that came installed in my hp pavillion a6500f.
i am very concerned that it is about to die.
after a little searching, i have read that even the replacements that samsung sends out are junk.
any suggestions on a different hd of similar size/speed to replace it with?
