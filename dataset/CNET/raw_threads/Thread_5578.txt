It has basic components like a standard X45 CD-Rom. It also has 256 megs of ram. You know a basic computer. Anyway I was wondering... What can I expect for video gaming and performance. IE:sound,Video, And whatnot.

You should not even try to run ANY games on this; it will crash. This is a computer for MS Word, and surfing the internet.
