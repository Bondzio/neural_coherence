I just got the Fp1 Biometric flash drive from Myflash.
When I open up the program on my school computer, where I need it most, I get an error - Can not load FAVPID.dll!
can anyone help me with a fix, or does anyone know of an alternate program the accepts fingerprints that doen't try and load a program on the computer?
Thanks!
