1.1.1	I have installed a Siemens Gigaset SE572 WLAN dsl wireless router.	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately it has only one port, for connection to PC.	St
1.1.3	I want to network my Dell 3100cn laser printer which is not wireless.	St
1.1.4	I have tried connecting a NEWLINK 5 port hub using the uplink to the wireless router but the router cannot recognise connection.	St
1.1.5	The port next to the uplink is empty and I have used NON-crossover cabling.	St
1.1.6	Can anyone advise me on how to network my printer.	Ques
1.2.1	Assume you mean 5 port switch, you have gone from router to primary input on switch, then to printer from # 1 port and of course have loaded software for switch?	St
1.3.1	Hi Phil Thanks for your reply.	St
1.3.2	I connected the PC to port 1 on a Netlink 5 port Ethernet switch, and connected the Uplink port to the only port on the Siemens Gigaset SE572 WLAN dsl.	St
1.3.3	The WLAN cannot detect the Netlink.	St
1.3.4	I can get the printer networked via the Netlink, no problem, but as the Siemens unit has only 1 port I have to connect it directly to the PC to enable me to access the internet.	St
1.3.5	I assumed I would be able to connect as in para 1, then connect the printer to port 2 on the Netlink and all would be well!!!	St
1.3.6	The software for the Siemens unit is installed and working ok. Again thanks for your time.	St
