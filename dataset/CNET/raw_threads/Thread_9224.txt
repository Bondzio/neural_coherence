The UMAX Powerlook II scanner is taking HALF A DAY to power up. That's 3 HOURS and it greatly impacts on our work flow. Below are the specs of the computer and the ADAPTEC SCSI card.

Printer, etc. If you have not, uninstall the scanner and reinstall the software. Sounds more like a hardware issue but always try the software first, then go from there.

But the software doesn't work when the hardware isn't detected when the computer starts. When the computer starts the Scanner isn't even detected in the device manager. Before last week if I hit refresh the scanner was detected and started but now nothing happens.

My suggestion would be to replace it with a newer USB input scanner, they aren't that expensive and are generally faster than the old SCSI hook ups.

It does seem to be a hardware issue because it's taking half a day from the time the Power button is pushed. This is even before I turn on the computer. In regard to your second point getting the usb scanner might be like pulling teeth as far as my supervisor is concerned.
