1.1.1	Hey: As some of you might remember, I just purchased a new DVD burner so I could start to make back ups of my files.	Sug
1.1.2	My machine already has a CD reader/player ONLY installed, so the DVD I got is an external unit.	St
1.1.3	Now being as ignorant of some technology as I am, I asked the salesguy alot of questions.	St
1.1.4	Basically to prove to him I was as ignorant as I stated.	St
1.1.5	I asked what the different X's meant, what this word meant, ect.	St
1.1.6	I also assumed certain things, but know all to well what ASSUME stands for, so I even asked those questions.	St
1.1.7	I guess I didn't go deep enough.	St
1.1.8	I had assumed that the DVD hooked up to the computer via a USB port or a card slot that needed to be installed.	St
1.1.9	I asked which it was, & was told that hook up was simple thru a USB port.	St
1.1.10	The unit even came with needed cables.	St
1.1.11	COOL!	St
1.1.12	I took it home.	St
1.1.13	It's been sitting on the kitchen table ever since.	St
1.1.14	I carefully read ALL the papers that came with it, twice even.	St
1.1.15	It seemed an easy enough job to do.	St
1.1.16	Ain't Plug & Play just WONDERFUL!	St
1.1.17	Anywho, tonight was/is &quot;Kid's Eat Free Night&quot; at the local Denny's.	St
1.1.18	They also have activities for the kid's to do before, during, & after they eat.	St
1.1.19	So, I figured we'd go there, & I'd tackle the install when we came home, after feeding the dogs.	St
1.1.20	That's when I noticed it.	St
1.1.21	On the box of the DVD, it stated &quot;EASY INSTALL&quot; thru a USB 2.0 port.	St
1.1.22	The machine the DVD's getting hooked up to is a Dell 4400.	St
1.1.23	It has 4 USB ports, 2 front, 2 rear.	St
1.1.24	They are USB 1's I assume, since I had never heard about USB 2's when I got it.	St
1.1.25	As a matter of fact, today was the 1st time I had ever heard of USB 2's, while going thru THIS forum.	St
1.1.26	That was before I even knew I had made this mistake.	St
1.1.27	From what I read about USB 2's, they are about 40X's faster than regular USB's.	St
1.1.28	Also, ya can't Mix N' Match em.	St
1.1.29	I don't know, but the plugs look the same to me.	St
1.1.30	So now I'm sitting here with this DVD that I can't use, yet.	St
1.1.31	My question is this, &quot;What do I do to correct this problem?&quot; Are there any type of adapters out there?	Ques
1.1.32	Also, I have another question.	St
1.1.33	What is different between the terms &quot;BURN&quot; & &quot;RIP&quot;?	St
1.1.34	A BIG THANKS IN ADVANCE!	St
1.2.1	All you need is to get a PCI USB 2.0 card to plug the drive into.	St
1.2.2	They are inexpensive and will add 3-4 USB 2 ports.	St
1.2.3	That way you have 2.0 and 1.0.	St
1.2.4	The USB 1 and USB 2 plugs are identical.	St
1.2.5	USB 1 is 12Mb/s USB 2 is 480Mb/s When you bought the 4400 USB 2 was not available, so it wasn't your error.	St
1.3.1	JMarchi: So I assume (there's that word again) the card plugs into an expansion slot?	St
1.3.2	Thanks also for the way ya worded your answer.	St
1.3.3	Ya made it seem that I wasn't that much of a dumby.	St
1.4.1	Yes, you get a PCI USB card and plug it into one of the slots in the back of your system.	St
1.4.2	Easy to do.	St
1.4.3	Search google with just PCI and USB and you will find a lot of them in the $20 range.	St
1.5.1	JMarchi: Circuit City wanted $70.	St
1.5.2	for a 5 holer.	St
1.5.3	CDW's just down the street from me, less than a mile.	St
1.5.4	So, how's about the difference between burning & ripping?	St
1.6.1	and putting on a cd, burning is the action of putting on a cd?	St
1.6.2	maybey this will help?	St
1.6.3	http://www.cdrom-guide.com/forums/archive/index.php/f-11-p-35	St
1.7.1	You can get a 3 or 4 port (or even 5) USB 2 PCI card for $20-35 from any reputable dealer.	St
1.7.2	Circuit city is not one.	St
1.7.3	Check it out on tne web, get a reality check and don't over pay to hurry it up.	St
1.7.4	What's COMPUsa want, problem with them, I have seen them charge $26 for a USB cable that was $7, same Brand and model at a store down the street.	St
1.7.5	You can get ripped off big time on small things if you are not willing to order and wait a few days.	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	JMarchi: Thanks.	St
1.9.2	I used the Circuit City/CDW, experence as an example to my son about shopping.	St
1.9.3	Showed him that because I was in a hurry and didn't fully research my purchase, I coulda ended up giving Circuit City an extra $60.	St
1.9.4	Luckily, I did get a good/alright deal on the DVD.	St
1.9.5	I gulped when I was at CDW & asked about what they had.	St
1.9.6	Fortunately, I did a quick search before I went to get the card & saw that the average price for a 2 holer was about $20/25.	St
1.9.7	I also saw that CDW had a 6 holer on sale for $45., so when the guy at Circuit City said they were out of 2 holers but had a 5 holer for $70., I said forget that & went to CDW.	St
1.9.8	Got the 4 holer for $12.	St
1.9.9	(It almost sounds like we're talking about outhouses ;))Thanks.	St
1.10.1	I got my 4 &quot;holer&quot;(3 outer/1 inner) for $9 at Fry's on sale.	St
1.10.2	I still haven't figured out why you got an external unit for a lot more money and more headaches than an internal unit.	St
1.10.3	Anyway, good luck.	Polite
1.10.4	chuck	St
1.11.1	When the term &quot;ripping&quot; is used it generally means converting one format to a different format.	St
1.11.2	Such as ripping a wav.	St
1.11.3	file to a mp3.	St
1.11.4	file.	St
1.11.5	John	St
1.12.1	chuckieu: I've already got a CD Rom installed, & it was suggested that if I got an external I'd be able to do disk to disk burns.	St
1.12.2	I do have another bay to install another whatever in, but I really don't feel like messing around with this Dell, as it has been such a pleasure since day 1.	St
1.12.3	Ooops, a lightning bolt almost got me.	St
1.12.4	I'm looking forwards to the day when we get another HD for it & turning this one into a slave.	St
1.12.5	Darned bolt almost got me again!	St
