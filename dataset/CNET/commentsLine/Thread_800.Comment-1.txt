i need help with hl-dt-st rw/dvd gcc-4242n combo drive.i just got a trouble with my drive.
it worked fine.
then i installed pes 6 (a pc game), and my cdrom didnt work anymore.
its icon hasnt appeared in my computer.
i tried to uninstall pes 6, but it still didnt work.
lately, i found out that my cdrom driver was corrupted or something like that.
does anyone know how to fix that problem.
or where can i find the driver for my combo drive.i need to use it urgently.thanks p/s: i asked a guy about it.he said it might be cause by starforce protection ( this game software protection) or any similar protection.but he doesnt know how to fix it.
