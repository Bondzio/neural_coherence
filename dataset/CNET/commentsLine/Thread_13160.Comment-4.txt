i loved my old brother laser printer -- i'd gotten used to it at work, and i could get high-yield house-brand toner cartridges for it pretty cheap from quill (the other office-supply chains all seemed to carry house-brand toner for it, too).
i'm curious as to which brother multifunction machine you got; my local pamida store carries 2 different models (plus a current-model brother monochrome personal laser printer).
none of the brother printers are currently on sale at pamida; however, since they usually put one printer on sale each week, i can get one locally at a decent price if i'm willing to wait.
(maybe their price-matching policy would stretch to same-model printers on sale at those out-of-town office supply chain stores, too!)
i'd like to match the scanner size of my current standalone scanner (the epson 3490 scans originals up to 8.5&quot;x14&quot;); i also like the idea of having separate cyan/magenta/yellow cartridges instead of a single multicolor cartridge (sounds less wasteful that way).
it sounds like you got a &quot;tabloid-size&quot; multifunction machine; where did you get it, and how much did it cost?
