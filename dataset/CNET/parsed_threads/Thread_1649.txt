<s> I recently bought a new computer. </s>
<s> Was very pleased with it (4600AMD,2gb ram) .The graphics card is an Gigabyte Geforce 8600GT 512. </s>
<s> Works like a charm with the latest drivers installed. </s>
<s> However yesterday I connected the tv-out converter for the first time and connected the graphics card to my standard PAL tv using an old fashion composite cable. </s>
<s> I then turned on my computer and everything 3D including all games had Green Square checkerboard pattern. </s>
<s> Re formating doesn't Help and there is maximum air flow. </s>
<s> I Have searched the whole internet and it turns out other people have had this problem but no one has a solution. </s>
<s> Can anyone here help me? </s>

<s> As to the TV hookup, did you undo all that and go back to what worked? </s>
<s> You still could have lost that card. </s>
<s> Another card will tell. </s>
