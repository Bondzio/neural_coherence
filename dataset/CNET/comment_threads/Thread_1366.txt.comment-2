The easiest thing would be to change the motherboard, it would allow you to add an additional PCI-E card and would help to future proof your PC a little.
2 video cards in SLI (in your case 8600GTx2) would allow you to have 4 displays.
Keep in mind you would need a SLI ready Powersupply with the correct voltage and amps along with a SLI ready motherboard.
