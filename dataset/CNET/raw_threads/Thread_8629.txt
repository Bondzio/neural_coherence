Somewhere on this forum I heard that FAT32 storage is bad because it can break more easily then NTFS. Should I reformat the WD passport as NTFS, what exactly is the difference. To do this I'm guessing you Right Click --&gt; format --&gt;OK? Thanks

Apart from being more reliable, if my old memory serves me correctly, FAT32 uses 32kb clusters and NTFS uses 4kb. What that means to you is, if you have a file in FAT32 1kb in size it actually uses 32kb of hdd space, whereas an NTFS file of the same size would only use 4kb. If the above is not correct, no doubt Bob or someone else will give the correct figures. In advance, I claim old age for my memory deficiancies.

It's too prone to damage. Just do this. Copy a file to it and then yank the USB cord. Our NTFS volumes survive and I can kill the Fat32 volumes on demand. Yes we can format them and start over but where's the fun in that? Bob

639	6	336384	3011462	3011379	R. Proffitt	3/25/09 8:09 PM	1.23801174E12	In a nutshell.	I leave it to you to research file systems but let's highlight the basic issue. NTFS is damage resistant (not damage proof.) Fat32 is very compatible but suffers from not having any resiliency to most damage. Hey, it's YOUR choice here. I will not spend 20 posts telling you all the reasons and duplicating web pages. How important is your data and your time? Bob

Also people on this forum have convinced me that backing up to a dvd is also a good idea.

Why do they make it so that the new tvs pretty much have to use hdd in fat32 or wont load sometimes / freeze etc... when I want to play saved dvd, blue-ray, and personally recorded game vids that trump the file size ... Is there some better way I am suppose to go about this or suffer without a, larger files or b, not being able to get to data 1/4 the time...?

It's not cheap, and may not be easy. 2. Microsoft has been pretty tip lipped about NTFS over the years. Most of what was created in Linux was done via reverse engineering. And while the other file systems do exist, if you used them on the TV the users would blow up at you for using them. Bob
