<s> SoundBlaster Live 24-bit EAX console - device supported not detected I just installed a SoundBlaster Live 24-bit 7.1 sound card and Logitech X-530 5.1 speakers in my 2ghz Celeron 512 mb RAM XP Home emachines which came with Avance Audio apapter on the Mboard. </s>
<s> I get good sound through the front speakers and subwoofer, but nothing through the rear and center speakers. </s>
<s> When I try to run the Creative MediaSource Player's EAX console through the Tools Menu in Organizer (there is no green EAX Button), which I believe is what I need to turn on Surround Sound for this card, I just get an error message, ''The audio device supported by this application is not detected. </s>
<s> The application will exit''. </s>
<s> And it won't run. </s>
<s> I also installed the DFX Master Pack of audio plug-ins for Winamp, Win Media Player and others, but when I try to use them I get no sound at all in those programs. </s>
<s> When I originally ran the install program for the SoundBlaster Live, as it started I got this error:'' Setup could not detect any SoundBlaster Live! </s>
<s> 24-bit on your system. </s>
<s> Please ensure that you SoundBlaster Hardware is properly installed before running this setup program. </s>
<s> Setup will now exit''. </s>
<s> But then the install runs as if normal and ends with: ''Congratulations! </s>
<s> Your sound card was successfully installed'' Then I reboot as asked. </s>
<s> I've done this 3 times ending up with the same problem I described above. </s>
<s> I've checked the card position and the speaker wires several times and they all are correct. </s>
<s> The SB Live is thedefault sound card on the system. </s>
<s> Can you please help? </s>

<s> The motherboard drivers needed to be installed first. </s>
<s> It's a mess. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What do you mean by ''The motherboard drivers needed to be installed first''? </s>
<s> Which ones and where are they and how?Here's another aspect of my case. </s>
<s> After posting, I took the SB card back to Best Buy and exchanged it for another same card, thinking it could be bad. </s>
<s> I swapped PCI slots with a modem and rebooted. </s>
<s> After XP started I saw detection of &quot;new&quot; modem and &quot;new&quot; SB Live 24-bit sound card going on in the system tray. </s>
<s> Then an error box came up: &quot;The installshield engine (ikernel.exe) could not be installed. </s>
<s> The system cannot find the file specified&quot;. </s>
<s> Then XP abruptly turned off the computer and restarted. </s>
<s> This happened 4 times. </s>
<s> Then I took out all the cards and it rebooted OK. </s>
<s> In Control panel, the default audio device is now the original Avance AC97 Audio and the SB Live isn't even listed. </s>
<s> I never uninstalled anything that came with the card. </s>
<s> I installed a new Maxtor 80gb drive to replace my old 40gb that came with the machine. </s>
<s> I used the MaxBlast software to copy the entire old drive to make the new one the C: boot drive. </s>
<s> It boots and everything is as it was, except a few programs thought they weren't registered or their trial period was over. </s>
<s> The &quot;unregistered&quot; ones worked OK after I entered the reg. </s>
<s> No's. </s>
<s> This has me wondering if the MaxBlast program overlooked or corrupted a few files, probably hidden ones. </s>
<s> Or a certain folder where all these reside. </s>
<s> I left my old drive intact with all the files on it in the machine as E: I relabelled the C: drive before the sound card installation. </s>
<s> It was fornerly &quot;Local Disk&quot;. </s>
<s> Could that be a problem for programs looking for certain files? </s>
<s> I just did a search for ikernel.exe It is in the same path on both drives, &quot;\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\Engine\6\Intel 32&quot;. </s>
<s> I am holding off doing anything else until I get answers to some questions, like: a. </s>
<s> Should I uninstall all the Creative software? </s>
<s> What special thing should I do with the device drivers etc? </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> The install instructions said to hit Cancel if XP asked for the device drivers. </s>
<s> Should I run their install again anyway? </s>
<s> c. Could the &quot;missing&quot; ikernel be why the EAX app is malfunctioning? </s>
<s> d. I did a System Restore save point just before switching hard drives. </s>
<s> should I restore it first? </s>
<s> e. Should I get a different card? </s>
<s> Would that really help? </s>
<s> After all, I just wanted to listen to some music! </s>
<s> ------ droidbot7000 </s>
<s> If you get a Creative card, go straight to creative.com and get the upgraded software. </s>
<s> The stuff they sent with the card was junk and cost me a day trying this and that! </s>
