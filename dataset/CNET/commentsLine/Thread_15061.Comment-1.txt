i have a pretty good computer right now but i feel that there are some problem spots that need to be looked at.
specs: ati 4870hd intel e6750 2.66ghz 4mb cashe g.skill 8g's ram western digital hd's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply i have about 250 dollars to spend right now and i was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card.
what im having problems with is what to do with that money.
from what i know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last.
so my question is what should i do with that money??
stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core.
(im going to have to stick to my lga 775 socket)
