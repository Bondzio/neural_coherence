well a person on another board told me that no other softwares will give me a more accurate status reading of my pc then my system bios.
accordingly i went into bios setup (pressing del twice) and checked out an option called pc health status.
it showed.. cpu temperature : 67c cpu fan speed : 4821-4963 rpm system fan speed : 0 rpm now here i have some questions.
first is 67c an ok temp for my pc.
second what is the difference between cpu fan and system fan.
i can open my cpu cabinet.
can someone tell me how to identify and check if both cpu and system fan are there and working.
i can see three fans, one on the board (motherboard), second attached to the cabinet which can be seen from the back holes of the cabinet and third i believe in the power supply box inside at the topmost side of the cabinet.
checking with a flashlight, they all seems to be rotating.
system info: gigabyte 8i845gvmrz motherboard, intel pentium 4, chipset i845g, 512 mb ram running windows 2000 pro, and award modular bios v6.00pg
