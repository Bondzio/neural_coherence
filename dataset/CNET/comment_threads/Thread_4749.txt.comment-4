it's a slideshow on 6800 series cards, even SLI doesn't break 50 FPS in anything)) www.futuremark.com and just download the free demo versions it'll give you a good idea of how the computer performs in gaming application if your interested in how it performes in non gaming application, get PCMark2004, as it will benchmark office productivity and other non-gaming type things
