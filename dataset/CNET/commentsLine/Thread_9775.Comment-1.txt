this is a small issue... computer: i have a dell dimension 8400 (p4 3.0ghz, 2.5gb ram, 80gb sata drive).
original power supply is 350 watts.
my modifications: * added a linksys ethernet nic, on-board connection died * pci card with 4 usb 2.0 ports * combo firewire (2 ports)/usb 2.0 (4 ports) pci expansion card (bought but haven't installed, so count it) * 2gb of ddr2 sdram, 533 mhz, on top of my original 512mb other than that i am running everything on external power, e.g.
external hdd, flash drives which are bus-powered.
between ms office documents, music collection, and pictures, i have finally gotten to 2/3 full on my original hdd and want to add on another sata drive in the 160-250gb range.
my question... do i need a new power supply?
if so, what do you recommend?
is there some formula i could use to calculate my needs?
it is a dell so i also have concerns about proprietary equipment dimensions, cabling, etc.
also, does anyone have any successes with any hard drive makers?
thanks!
