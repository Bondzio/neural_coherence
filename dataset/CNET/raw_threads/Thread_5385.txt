After a short while, it will drop the speed again until it disconnects and reconnects again. This is the third Linksys WRT54GL that has done this. The first one was 5 years old before it started doing this in February, the second was 3 months old, and now the replacement Linksys sent to me is doing this? Does anyone know what is going on with my router? I am able to connect fine with the Cat5 cable, but wireless seems to be the problem. Even my phone(s) get disconnected from the wireless router. This problem just recently started and I don't know why, no settings had been changed on any of the routers until after the problem had already ocurred, then the Linksys phone tech support had me make multiple changes.

If it gets too many errors at a certain speed it will continue to reduce the speed until it gets one that works. Errors are generally caused by interference. You many times will still see good signal strength since that does not measure the quality. You best option is to change the channel until you find one that is more stable. Finding the source of the interference is tough. It ranges from microwave ovens to the neighbors routers. I would next try a different nic on your PC since it might be that end causing the issue. Last you could try to replace all your equipment (router and nics) with stuff that supports 802.11n. N is more tolerant of interference than G. Your other option is to buy dual band equipment and move to the 5G band.

While changing the channel is a great idea, if WEP is noted or if someone is trying MAC filters, those old security are now ineffective. Time to move up to WPA2 if possible. Bob

The USB wireless nic work on both laptop and desktop. Since you have already replaced the router it is unlikely a hardware issue. It is also very unlikely it is a hardware issue with your nic card but it is the cheapest thing to try next. When you start replacing hardware it generally means you have tried everything else.

This is true for cable, DSL, Fios, satellite. The more people in the pool that you share are on, the slower your connection. As people disconnect or their activity ceases your bandwidth increases again. DSLreports.com has a nice speed measuring tool which works not only for DSL. It is quite reliable. Use that during different hours of the day.
