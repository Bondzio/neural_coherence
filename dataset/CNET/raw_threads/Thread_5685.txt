Right now the problem is that something is not letting me navigate certain web pages. For example: dell support, or apple, or java. I've tried changing the firewall, internet, and antivirus settings but nothing has changed. If there's anyone that can help me I would gladly appreciate it. Simcerely, aloairam. PD. I'm using AVG:antivirus, ad-aware:sypware, and windows firewall. I'm open to any other program that you suggest.
