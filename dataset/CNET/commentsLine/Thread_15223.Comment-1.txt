that's my question as written above.
what part of the motherboard determines and configures a hard drive to be recognized on either the primary channel or secondary channel.
i am aware of the fact that a drive determines whether its a master or slave depending on the jumper that is configured for each drive.
but which chip actually configures the drive to be on the primary or secondary channel ?
would it be the bios or does the southbridge or a combination of both play a role in this process ?
i hope my questions are clear though i apology in case they are not.
i would be happy to explain it further so please just go ahead and ask.
