if you look closely one of the clips is &quot;hinged&quot; thus it will move away after pushing down on that clip.
when free, twist and wingle the heatsink to break free the heatsink itself as the heatsink compounf may have siezed it abit.
you can now unlock the cpu zif handle to remove cpu &quot;with care&quot;, denote the ordination should you decide to remove cpu.
good luck -----willy
