Just the response I needed.
Thanks!
Yes, I am aware of 64-bit Windows and it's ability to address more memory, but I really don't consider that a very useful Windows as most of the programs I run, like you said, would not run on 64-bit.
So when I said &quot;Windows&quot; I had in mind &quot;32-bit Windows&quot; and should've specified.
And I definitely agree with you on how big numbers sell, and I was actually considering putting that in my original question.
Hard drive space, CPU speed, etc.
Big numbers do sell.
I just wanted to know if there was any practical use of the four gigs of ram, other than Linux or attempting to use 64-bit Windows, like if it somehow improved 32-bit Windows experience.
Is there any future possibility of a 32-bit system compatible with more RAM, or 64-bit systems actually becoming useful?
