I purchased a new iPad last week!
However, news today I read shows that in the next iPad event a more latest iPad is going to be released!!
This is my first apple product, and one reason as to why I delayed buying the iPad in the first place.
My manager told me &quot;they're ALWAYS going to be updating the products&quot; - so stop waiting!!
Should I return the product?
(despite using it in and out for a week!
); or just accept it and move on and enjoy my current ipad?
(New ipad model) Thank you
