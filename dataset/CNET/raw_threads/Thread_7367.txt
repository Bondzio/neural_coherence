I recently got a Nvidia GeForce 8400GS PCI card and had it installed and working fine in a 4-year old eMachines. But I removed the card before swapping it for a nearly new eMachines W3650. For some reason, the card doesn't work in the new computer. It's physically installed OK, it's got power; the cooling fins get very warm, the drivers loaded OK, and I disabled the onboard graphics. Device Manager says it's &quot;working properly&quot;, for what that's worth. When I plug the monitor cable into the card, there's nothing. Black screen. Am I missing something, or could the card have died somehow?

While the big news was all about the mobile 8400M defects, that is being seen in the desktop cards. Type 8400 DEFECTIVE on google. Sorry to read about your loss. And of course, check your work. Power off, re-seat it, etc. Bob

I get them to fix and play with from time to time, as this one is. I'd rather not try it in my &quot;main&quot; computer. It cost less than $40 at Newegg.

Have you tried swapping the VGA card back to the old machine? Did it work? If yes then your card doesn't have any problem. Try checking your new machine, do you have other VGA cards that is working with the new computer? It is also possible that you need to connect the Monitor/LCD into a DVI-connector instead of regular Serial/video cable on your VGA card. Good luck on your PC.

I will look around for a DVI cable. The old machine, where it worked, is now in use at my son-in-law's house. No other extra VGA card on hand. But one way or another, I'll dig up a piece of hardware so I can prove whether the card is bad or not. I still have mfg. warranty time. Thanks for your suggestions. My biggest concern was that it was something I wasn't doing right.

It's a PCI graphics card, but I tried a PCI-Express graphics card, which worked ok. Then I needed something to try in the PCI slot, so I used a PCI-USB card, which worked fine. I haven't had the opportunity to try this PCI graphics card in another computer, but if the PCI slot works ok, then I'm convinced it's the card that doesn't work. I'm working on RMAing it.
