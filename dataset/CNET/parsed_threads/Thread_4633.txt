<s> What ONE specific video card would you recommend? </s>
<s> gamewise, 3 years is forever tech-wise so anything you buy will be obsolete by then. </s>
<s> you're $100 short of a geforce 8800gts/gtx which is the most future-proof cards available. </s>
<s> so, i think you should save $100 and get a geforce 7950gt. </s>
<s> speed-wise its close to a 7900gtx/x1850xt and it includes 512mb ram. </s>
<s> it should tide you over for a year so by then you can get another mid-range card that will spank anything available now. </s>
