Hey thanks, I guess that makes some sense, I have an old 2.4GHz Uniden portable that I use, and I have my house hard-wired with cat6 cable and just stuck the wireless router at a wall terminal.
I guess that I need to incorporate it into my system but I think I'm getting rid of Roadrunner soon, so just didn't want to hassle with it.
It works fine if I just stay off of the phone........
