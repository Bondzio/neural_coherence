my friend has a samsung hd103uj hdd, 1tb, and he used it to put his pictures of family from russia (his home country) before upgrading his windows xp to 7. after the install, he went to put the pictures back, only to get a message telling him to reformat.
so he called me and i plugged it into my laptop with windows xp, only to get the same message.
he doesn't have money to spend on getting these pictures back, so i was wondering i anyone knew of a way to get pictures from a hdd that isn't readable by windows xp or 7 without paying someone $800.
i looked into some programs that retrieve the info and cost less than $100 but from further research it sounds like maybe something maybe wrong with the hdd, and samsung will only replace it, not help recover data.
thanks to any and all help!
