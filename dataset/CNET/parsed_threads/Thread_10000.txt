<s> your motherboard is socket 939 and pci-express, so you would need a socket 939 processor not 754 nor an agp card like you currently have. </s>

<s> dont forget windows nor arctic silver 5 if needeed. </s>
<s> caboes come with motherboard so if the drives are oem its okay. </s>

<s> Do i need that new power supply (is it necessary) and also, i was looking at the motherboard connections (USB, PS/2 on the back and they don't line up with the case. </s>
<s> Is this a problem? </s>
<s> USUALLY motherboards will come with one of those things to put on the case. </s>
<s> don't worry once u do the first boot and it works: u'll feel gud. </s>
<s> Oh yea! </s>
<s> PLZ CHECK ALL CABLES ESPECIALLY FANS BEFORE EVEN PLUGGING ANY TYPE OF POWER IN! </s>
<s> CHECK THE FANS! </s>
<s> CHECK! </s>
<s> TRIPLE CHECK. </s>
<s> Oh yea: good luck! </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> Probably new psu, as the ones with the case really sucks... Low amps on the +12V. </s>
<s> Wattage isn't the only factor when purchasing a psu. </s>
<s> the two i said are pretty good. </s>
<s> I would've gone for 3000+, because the 3500+ only has a higher clock speed, that's the only difference. </s>
<s> You can save quite a bit, and if you really want 3500+, i suggest getting a 3700+ San Diego instead because the 1MB l2 cache is very useful. </s>
<s> Don't get ATI due to no SM 3.0Support, you don't want to be playing games in Direct X 8.0 in the future. </s>
<s> Go for either a 6600gt, or 6800 instead. </s>
<s> Don't forget arctic silver 5, it's way better than the stock, and $8 a tube seems like a good investment into a $300ish processor. </s>
<s> Do you have windows? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I think i got what you guys suggested. </s>

<s> although you can use ide hard drives, serial ata offers better performance and WAY thinner cables. </s>
<s> thats really all you need to change, otherwise, that is a perfect build. </s>
<s> the 6600gt will not disapoint as i also have one and its perfect . </s>
<s> konny </s>
