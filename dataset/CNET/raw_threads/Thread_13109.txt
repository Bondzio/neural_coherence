Will a new graphics card allow me to squeeze another year or so out of this system? Played Half-life 2 w/out too much difficulty, F.E.A.R. w/ graphics turned down a fair amount. Thnx

Who has time to build their own system My Dell has actually served me pretty well, looking at the XPS 600. What would be the AMD equivalent? Dell has some pretty good free upgrades, plus I have a 20% off coupon.....
1579	4	169177	1873685	1873570	ramarc	4/13/06 10:42 AM	1.14492492E12	Radeon x800gto or geForce 6800gs	A SAPPHIRE 100131L Radeon X800GTO 256MB is about $170. A BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256MB is about $200. It's hard to find apples-to-apples benchmarks for the 9800pro and these cards so you'll have to interpolate. The X800GTO will perform between an X800 Pro and an X800XL; the 6800GS will be a bit better than a 6800GT. http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/07/05/vga_charts_vii/page5.html As you can see, both will be a nice upgrade over your 9800Pro. Anything less (6600gt or x1600xt) would not give you any significant boost.

There are regular 9800's with 256MB, but that doesn't mean that they perform better than the Pro. If you don't want to build a new system, and you're planning on spending a couple grand on an XPS600, I'd look at Overdrive PC.

Also, I'm not sure what the AMD equivalent of a Dual Core Pentium D 3.0 ghz is. With the 20% discount, I can get the XPS w/ the above processor, GeForce 6800, Xi-fi audio, 2 gigs of RAM, and a 20&quot; flat panel for about 2 grand. Seems like a decent deal.........

The AMD equivalent of the 930 would be the X2 3800+, but when Overdrive overclocks it, it becomes the equivalent of the EE955. True, the Overdrive costs more than the Dell, but you're getting a better machine from a better company.

That 6800 will suck, especially playing at 1600x1200, but at least he won't need to upgrade the PSU for a better gfx card. If I were spending this much money on a PC, I'd get Overdrive becuase they overclock everything to the max, and they use AMD. But it's his money, and therefore his decision.
