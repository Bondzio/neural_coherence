<s> Been working fine since November however today while using it, the device started to make a low grinding noise. </s>
<s> I disconnected the USB and the noise stopped. </s>
<s> However when I re attached the USB problems started. </s>
<s> Firstly, the windows explorer of drive :F was responding very slowly, when I tried to copy a few things over explorer.exe crashed. </s>
<s> This happened a few times after. </s>
<s> However on a reset on the computer and reboot of device, I could not even access the storagebird. </s>
<s> On my computer the device had been renamed to local disk opposed to Storagebird which it is meant to be, and also every 2 mintues the blue light flashed for a few seconds. </s>
<s> Finally after about 10 mintues of windows explorer crashing (firefox and other programs worked fine) the light stopped flashing and a error came up saying :F\ is not accessible. </s>
<s> The request could not be performed because of I/O device error. </s>
<s> At November most things have the one year warranty so call it in to get a replacement. </s>
<s> As to backup, what to do with the files you didn't backup, we've discussed this in this forum a few times so be sure to leverage those discussions. </s>
