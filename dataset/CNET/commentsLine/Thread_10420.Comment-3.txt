hi bob, yea i know a bit about ip routing.
what i can't get my mind wrapped around is intercepting the http get requests and being able to change the interface it goes out on.
i read a good deal about &quot;bonding&quot; and not sure if thats what i am looking for.
i want to be able to, effectively, choose which interface i use on each request.
most talk about bonding or this type of thing leads into a reply with - you should just by a better router with load balancing.
i am not looking for this.
i want to write an application that filters the request and chooses an interface based on the content type.
i appreciate your fast response.
let me know what you think.
thanks, nick
