i have sony vaio vgc-rc210g it comes with an ati x300 pci-e. needless to say it's a bit low on the gaming scale.
so i was looking to upgrade to say an ati 1900 xtx, or similar.
i was wondering if any one with a rc210g has upgraded there graphics card and to what, ati, nvidia?
also how well it works for you?
