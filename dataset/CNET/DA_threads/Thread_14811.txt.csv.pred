1.1.1	Hey there , I recently bought an & quot ; entry-level & quot ; tablet running on Android 4.1 and when I try to connect to my home wi-fi router it says & quot ; Saved , secured with WPA2 & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	Then I click on the name again , and for about 2 seconds it tries to cennect , but then I get the same & quot ; Saved , secured with WPA2 & quot ; and it 's not working ... On the other hand , when I used a wi-fi hotspot on my Android phone the wi-fi worked just fine .	St
1.1.3	So , any of you know the solution ?	Ques
1.1.4	What should I edit in the router settings ?	Ques
1.1.5	Please help !	St
1.2.1	None at all .	St
1.2.2	I 'd re-review the router settings and share what you can .	St
1.2.3	I 'd also test this at a free wifi hotspot and if it fails there , this one goes back .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	First of all thanks for yours answer .	Polite
1.3.2	Second , I opened the router settings again , and I 'll share the pictures to let you see what are the current details : http : //puu.sh/43pVt/665ae848b2.png http : //puu.sh/43pVT/b12027fd65.png	St
1.4.1	In your first picture I see you did n't enter a WPA2 password in your router .	St
1.4.2	It 's blank while it should be from 8 to 64 characters .	St
1.4.3	Then tell your tablet to use the same password .	St
1.4.4	Kees	St
