actually i tried connecting the enclosure to the usb port.
same result.
laptop detected the enclosure but when i double click on the new drive e it wouldnt let me access it.
infact when i went to the disk management tool the hdd shows up there as active and healthy and also as empty with 200 gb free.
do i need to install a new set of drivers ?
please advise.
