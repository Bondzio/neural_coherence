when i start up my pc i keep receiving a warning that there is a smart error on my hard drive-back up my data and replace my hard drive as soon as possible.
i try to run a scan disk but, it keeps restarting because something keeps writing to the disc.
how do i find out what keeps writing to the disc and how then can i stop it?
thanks for your help.
brian.
