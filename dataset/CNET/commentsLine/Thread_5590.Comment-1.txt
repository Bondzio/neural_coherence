hello all... i got a 250gb maxtor internal drive that i put in a usb 2.0 external enclosure.
i set the jumper to master, per the instructions that came with the enclosure.
i plan on only using it for file storage.
i was setting it up last night and the computer recognized a new usb drive and i installed the drivers for it (the drivers that came with the enclosure).
it did not show up in my computer, which was predicted in the instructions.
then i installed the software that came with the hd.
it found the hd and said that it was brand new and needed to be formatted.
that was around 10pm last night.
around 9am this morning when i left for work it was still spinning.
the progress bar hadn't moved... is it possible that it will take this long?
vital stats: p3 700 mhz computer windows 98se thanks in advance.
