Then you say that after the logo you see the normal boot screen. That's a contradiction. If you can't make your problem clear, you won't get effective help. By the way, what do you mean with 'normal boot screen'? Kees

Has been running for about 6 months with no problems, then out of the blue, when I start my computer, it will load my ASUS screen, then the Windows logo screen comes up, and it says &quot;please wait&quot; as it is loading, then the screen goes black and stays that way. On this black screen, my cursor is still visible and I can move it around, but the screen is completely black. I have tried many troubleshooting solutions, including: - system restore - trying a boot repair off of the Vista disc - unplugging/replugging USB components Any ideas?
