first of all, i need to know these things.. does an external hardrive perform the same as the internal one?
i mean, when i connect it through firewire or usb, can i use the data on it and use it as if it were on an internal hardrive?
like for example, i use the avi files on it and edit the videos.
would that be possible?
i also need an external hardrive which i can connect directly to a television cause primarily im gonna use the hardrive to store my home videos.. thank you in advance... any suggestions on a very good hardrive would be appreciated.. i need 100+gb hardrive..
