yes, the raid is for backup.
have two additional external backups of witch one is off site as well (photos (150gb), documents and other important stuff) i have been thinking about only having one of them internally and making a mirror to the external one every night instead.
(and this would let me change one of them to something quieter as well, not a completely bad solution) i'm getting a new 250gb ssd so yes, keeping that one as an external &quot;extra&quot; unit is one way to do it as i have an empty usb3 external case lying around.
that would be a fast one, but not that large the other hdd are 2 and 3tb so replacing them with something bigger is not much of an idea.
connecting the dvd to the extension card have been on my mind as that is the one i use the least (but i use it every other week ) so far moving one of them externally and giving up the raid is looking like the best way to go.
i think i will need to make a check of the raided hdd to check the helth of them.
can any of you recommend a good program to do that, i haven't had a lot of good results with that previously.
(i have a hdd on my desk that i have replaced get the ok from the check programs but sounds like a grinder from time to time)
