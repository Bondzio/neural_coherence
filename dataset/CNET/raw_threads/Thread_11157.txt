Proffitt	5/2/05 4:19 PM	1.11505074E12	The -12V is not as easily discarded.	&quot;The full PCI specification lists 5 Volt, 3.3 Volt, 12 Volt and -12 Volt power rails.&quot; - http://www.ncipher.com/products/faq_universal_pci.html While I can't recall a PCI card that relied on the -12V line, it was also used in older RS232 driver chips that were used at least till the Pentium 1 days. Maybe longer. Bob

Both +12 and -12 Volt is required and not optional. This was a defacto standard in PC designs for decades and ... didn't require much power as you noted. Bob
