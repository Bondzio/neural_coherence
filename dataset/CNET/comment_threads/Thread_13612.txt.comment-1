I have a minor problem with my monitor that I hope isn't a sign of a larger issue.
Every so often the screen will flicker slightly.
Not flicker completely but just a dim flicker.
I was trying to figure out what could be causing it when I was able to recreate it by pressing on the plastic bezel at the bottom of the screen right around where the buttons are.
It sends a flicker up the monitor screen when you squeeze on it that looks identical to my problem.
I don't know a lot about LCD monitors but should I contact Acer before my warranty expires or is this common?
The thing was relatively expensive so if it is on the way out, I need to take advantage of the warranty.
Thanks in advance!
