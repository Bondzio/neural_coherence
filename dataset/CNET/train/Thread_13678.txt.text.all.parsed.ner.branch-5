(note referencing above: comp has 1.1 usb interface, i'm willing to get an upgrade card) don't want to spend more than about $100-130 or so (plus no more than $15-30 for an interface upgrade card) i don't know that i need one-touch backup or things like that. i will be using this as supplemental storage, not primarily as a backup drive. a couple reasons i'm getting an external drive as opposed to an internal one are because there really isn't a whole lot of room left in the tower, and i often will want to take the drive with me and plug it into other computers (some of which may have lesser specs than our computer, btw). (also, we're running avg free edition (antivirus), which insists on scanning every single installed hard drive every single day (thankfully it lets you pause/cancel when it comes up, but it slows our computer down by a factor of 10 or more when it's running.)) so what are some models i should look at?

(keep in mind i'll be using it with a 4+ year old computer.) also, what about firewire, or external sata interfaces / drives? i do need to be able to stream high-definition uncompressed audio and video, often multiple streams, for editing and viewing on my local machine, allowing for any bottleneck ram / cpu / etc might present. and, for a 500gb (or 400gb) drive, is there a level below which i should avoid (meaning drives more prone to failure, for example, not necessarily having fewer features), even if i have to up my budget to, say, $135-150 or so?

(btw, the wd drive is pushing my price limit a bit, but if it's otherwise a really good drive i may be willing to consider it.) of course i'll need to get a usb 2.0 / firewire / sata interface card for our computer. (and, i still have that dang 127gib 28bit lba to deal with...)

6931	5	256030	2538793	2538574	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 11:00 am	1.1843244e12	yes...	windows 2000 professional sp4. dad may consider an upgrade to xp, but i don't know when/if (within the next year or so) that'll happen. so with the software and hardware (plus an add-on adapter card (all we have now is usb 1) that we currently have, should i try sata/esata? and how much slower is usb 2 than internal ide?
6931	6	256030	2538831	2538793	r. proffitt	7/13/07 11:29 am	1.18432614e12	the issues you have to deal with...	are more than usual. sata came out long after windows 2000 so you need to research not only if you can fit the sata card but if that card has drivers for windows 2000. as to the usb 2.0 it's under 1/2 the speed of ide. this is why it didn't meet your criteria. but since it's just nearline storage why would it matter? i use mine and can play music, video just fine. why such a hard criteria on speed? bob
6931	7	256030	2538946	2538831	pianoplayer88key	7/13/07 1:23 pm	1.18433298e12	...	oh, if it's only like as bad as 35-40% or so, whatever... i could probably live with that. when you said &quot;fraction&quot; in an earlier post i was thinking it was like 1/5 the speed or something like that. i just need to be able to stream uncompressed video (at least 640x480 24bpp 30fps) and audio (44.1khz 16 bit stereo, maybe more channels) to/from the drive in real time. i was just looking on wikipedia, and the max burst speed of usb 2.0 is 480mbit/sec, or 60 mbyte/sec. would that be enough for the data transfer i'll be doing? also, is it possible to get a drive that maybe i'll use usb 2.0 for now, but later when i get a new computer i'll be able to take advantage of a faster interface?
