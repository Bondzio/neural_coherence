Anything is possible, however its stretching abit for the USB port to crash or even fry the system.
One thing can lead to another and if all the ducks line-up the USB port could cause the PSU to lose that power leg and thus bring the system down, however that suggests the true use of the port wasn't proper or manufacturing boo-boo was done.
The USB port is the low-voltage and ampage variety.
If the system as you reported it has happened, then only physical exam and testing must be done to find the true cause.
Maybe a faulty USB was the tipping point and it went downhill from there, IMHO.
