1.1.1	My ISP is Telus.. we have the Speedtouch ST516v6 modem the modem is rated up to 10Mbps and my ISP can provide up to 15Mbps the setup : ISP & gt ; DLink ( DIR815 ) wireless router & gt ; 2 Netgear Gigabit GS108 switches .	St
1.1.2	first switch is for the house computers ( 4-5 computers , all wired connection ) second switch has 2 routers connected , they are on different floors .	St
1.1.3	router2 is a linksys router3 is a netgear .	St
1.1.4	what settings should be changed in order for people to connect too.. Im expecting anywhere from 30-60 users on at any given time .	St
1.1.5	there are people telling me that they sometimes arent connecting or connected but have no internet .	St
1.2.1	Ok.. so I take it that people on the second switch are losing connection .	St
1.2.2	I 'm also think that anyone who is directly connect is not reporting the issues or having any connection problem .	St
1.2.3	Are the only people reporting the issues are the linksys and netgear ?	Ques
1.2.4	If this is the case what model type of router 's are these and do they have a bridge setting so you can create one wireless network bridge .	St
1.2.5	One thing is to put the wireless route on different channels so they cancel each other signal .	St
1.2.6	try it .	Sug
1.2.7	let me know .	Sug
1.2.8	Always here to help .	St
1.2.9	If this was in the NYC , I would recommend calling Point to Point Solution , young guys that know alot of networking and fix problems like this one .	St
1.2.10	this is there link http : //www.ptps.us/ -chris	St
1.3.1	right now , i have done a 30/30/30 reset on the linksys and netgear routers so they are on default settings.. it seems a lot better but could be even better ... maybe i should try to flash the tomato or DDWRT firmware.. might work better .	Sug
1.4.1	Hi , Using the network cable that came with your wireless router temporarily connect your computer to one of the open network ports on your wireless router .	St
1.4.2	You must turn on your computer , then it will automatically connect to your router .	St
1.4.3	The next step is going to Internet explorer and type in the address to configure your router .	St
1.4.4	Then you might be prompted for a password .	St
1.4.5	The address and password depend on what type of router you have .	St
1.4.6	You have to refer the instructions included with your router .	St
1.4.7	The last step is connecting your computer to the wireless network .	St
