If your wireless adapter is a mini-PCI card from Dell, update its driver from Dell.com. Otherwise, update the external wirless adapter from the mfg website. Windows Update once suggested a driver for a Linksys Wireless-G PCMCIA adapter. I installed it, but it had troubles connecting. I have been updating my Linksys adapter drivers from Linksys.com ever since and without a problem. My relevant equipment: Dell Inspiron 5150 Dell Wireless 1450 Dual Band WLAN Mini-PCI Card Linksys WRT54GS
