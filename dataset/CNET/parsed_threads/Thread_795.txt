<s> Every so often, my router would decide to cut out and suddenly lose all connection. </s>
<s> I can't log into the router, no connection to the internet, and have to run a power cycle to get things back to normal. </s>
<s> This could happen between 10 minutes or 10 hours. </s>
<s> I've looked around and seen a bunch of others with the same issue and no solution. </s>
<s> Something tells me its just the hardware. </s>
<s> I also have two other routers I got to try and replace it, but came up with their own issues. </s>
<s> One's a Linksys newer WRT54G2 model, the small black ones. </s>
<s> It doesn't have the disconnect issue but I had problems getting its wireless to broadcast properly. </s>
<s> I also have an older WRT54G that worked fine at my apartment but after I tried a hard reset I can't access it anymore, it won't even show up on the network. </s>
<s> Disable the radio after a hard reset? </s>
<s> I don't see in your post where you plug in and configure the router. </s>
