1.1.1	I bought an acer aspire Z3750 which is an all-in-one model .	St
1.1.2	Very happy with the performance , but struggling with the tilted screen , which has an uncomfortable angle .	St
1.1.3	When chatting or skyping , the webcam only picks up the upper part of the face , as the screen is facing up the ceiling .	St
1.1.4	and my six-year-old has to sit on his knees on the chair in order to see the screen properly .	St
1.1.5	has anyone a solution for this problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	From the images I can see in a Google search the screen seems to be fixed at that angle .	St
1.2.2	All I could suggest is to prop it up .	St
1.2.3	Place something solid under the stand at the back so it tilts forward .	St
1.2.4	The legs on the monitor itself do n't look as though they will stand flat at any other angle so it might be unstable , but I ca n't see any other way to adjust the angle .	St
1.2.5	I do n't know what ports this unit has , but if it has a spare VGA port then you could try connecting another monitor and using that as your main display , but the web cam issue wo n't be solved .	St
1.2.6	Shame .	St
1.2.7	It looks a nice , sleek model .	St
1.2.8	Mark	St
1.3.1	thanks , yes , the computer is great .	Polite
1.3.2	i have tried propping it up , but was afraid of unstability .	St
1.3.3	i was wondering if the foot has different settings and i just was n't seeing how to set it up any other way .	St
1.3.4	maybe some users have the same model and have also experienced this ?	Ques
1.4.1	I did a quick check of the Acer supplied user guide and it offered practically nothing in & quot ; how to adjust & quot ; the viewing angle .	St
1.4.2	Though , it mentions to adj the viewing angle for better viewing and/or the user adj .	St
1.4.3	themselves to help reduce strain and ease of viewing .	St
1.4.4	I would think at least some minor adj .	St
1.4.5	is possible but most AIO tend to be very limited in travel of the screen or whole AIO for that matter .	St
1.4.6	I did n't check into a true manual from Acer which would have been more helpful .	St
1.4.7	Acer does supply these with the system or file based in order to print out .	St
1.4.8	If you like visit the Acer support website as well .	St
1.4.9	I also would suggest if that model is capable of being VESA mounted .	St
1.4.10	That way , buy the mounting h/w and you truly can move the AIO itself more aptly .	St
1.4.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	I see that this may be a recent purchase .	St
1.5.2	Why keep it ?	Ques
1.5.3	If you think it 's a design defect , call it that and ask for a full refund .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	I have the same problem as the other posts .	St
