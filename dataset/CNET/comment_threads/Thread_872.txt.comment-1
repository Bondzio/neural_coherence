Equipment: Netgear 2200 modem / router Vivotek SD8311E camera Windows XP pro IP Camera is wired to router.
IP cam has static local IP.
I can see the IP cam on my *wired* laptop and wired PCs.
I am unable to connect to IP cam when I use my laptop *wirelessly*.
As soon as I plug in the CAT5 cable between the laptop and router, IP cam connects again (I connect by typing the local IP cam address into a browser window).
I am able to see the wireless HP printer.
I am also able to connect to the IP cam from outside the LAN since I have forwarded the appropriate ports - just fyi.
What do I need to do to connect to the local IP cam from my local wireless laptop?
Thanks!
