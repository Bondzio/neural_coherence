<s> Is there a way to stop printer configuration things at startup and everytime I put a cd in the drive? </s>
<s> It gets really annoying that the printer configures before anything else happens. </s>
<s> This doesn't sound like a hardware issue. </s>
<s> And no OS or printer model is supplied. </s>
<s> All I can suggest is that you make a new post in the OS forum that matches your machine's OS and tell about the printer make/model/connection. </s>
