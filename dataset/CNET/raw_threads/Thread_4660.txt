Here's what I want: portable with good battery life. I don't travel a lot so can deal with a little more bulk and weight but I want battery life so I can run a photo portfolio in my art booth at festivals. wireless internet: want to stream Pandora in my art studio off my wireless signal on my desktop. Do some notebooks &quot;receive&quot; better than others? The only 2 programs other than internet and email I care about running on this computer will be adobe photoshop for editing pictures and nvu for updating my web site. I'll keep all files/photos on a memory stick. I know adobe is a resource hog but is it possible to put it on a budget netbook if other applications are very limited? Would the HP 110 mini work for these needs? thanks, annb
