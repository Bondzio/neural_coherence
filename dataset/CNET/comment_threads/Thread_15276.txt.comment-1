So i over clocked my AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2Ghz to 2.46Ghz and when i use my computer for any reason sometimes its 5 minutes sometimes more i get a Blue Screen that says something about hardware i've never finished it but after it i turned it down to 2.25Ghz and i dont get it anymore.
Is this hardware, software, maybe not enough cooling?
Please help
