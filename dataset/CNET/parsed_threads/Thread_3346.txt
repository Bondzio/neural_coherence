<s> I finally have a network. </s>
<s> When I clik on &quot;View Workgroup Computers&quot; I see the computer I am networked to. </s>
<s> When I clik on the computer though, I get an error message: This computer is not accessible. </s>
<s> Please contact the server administrator to see if you have permission to access this computer. </s>
<s> I set absolutely ZERO security. </s>
<s> Could it be those pesky firewalls? </s>
<s> With no OS mentioned, I can't tell you any direct actions, but for XP, firewalls are the number 1 reason I see people fail at making a network. </s>
<s> Next are things like. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Didn't install drivers. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Invalid configurations (example? </s>
<s> Cable modem to hub, PCs to hub, no router) 3. </s>
<s> Didn't ask the USER account to the XP machine and the client... http://www.wown.com has most of this. </s>
<s> I don't duplicate that content here. </s>

<s> Laptop has xp pro, desktop has xp home. </s>
<s> what is the USER thing? </s>
<s> If so, you didn't read the articles. </s>
<s> If you won't, then what to do? </s>
<s> As to the USER accounts, the simple issue is that you have logged into some XP machine as &quot;someone.&quot; I will never know this unless you reveal it. </s>
<s> Do you have the &quot;someone&quot; account on both machines? </s>
<s> Do you have a &quot;share&quot; shared? </s>
<s> Some don't want to do homework, just &quot;gimme&quot; the answer. </s>
<s> Sorry, I teach fishing. </s>
<s> No fish today. </s>
<s> In closing, your post is far too light. </s>
<s> I noted the firewall issue, but you neglected to tell the full details. </s>
<s> How can you be helped? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll learn to fish, but it would help if you described the tools a little better. </s>
<s> I'm signed in as &quot;Someone&quot; yes. </s>
<s> On my laptop I'm signed in as Myself. </s>
<s> That Myself needs a password to get in. </s>
<s> The desktop signs in automatically becuase there is only one account, no password. </s>
<s> If that is what you were talking about, I pat myself on the back for understanding. </s>
<s> And your article is also in nerd-ese. </s>
<s> I know what a ping is, but I sure as anything dont know how to send one. </s>
<s> And he isn't any clearer about that. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> I see you found how to control the firewall so that's a good step in the right direction. </s>
<s> I offer ZERO support for Zone Alarm as you can tell. </s>
<s> That's for ZoneLabs to do, so I leave that to them. </s>
<s> It's sad to see people struggle so with this product. </s>
<s> As to www.wown.com, it's all you do need to know, except for the firewall issue. </s>
<s> Which I noted. </s>
<s> What more can I offer people? </s>
