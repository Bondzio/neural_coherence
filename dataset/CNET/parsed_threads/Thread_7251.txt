<s> I understand that the best place to put the wireless router in your house is up as high as you can. </s>
<s> The problem is that my house like most has all of the networking run into the basement. </s>
<s> I have 3 computers hooked to a linksys WRT600N and a laptop hooked up with a wireless connection. </s>
<s> I have one more port open on my router. </s>
<s> I know that I can buy the Linksys WGA600N Wireless Access Point and hook another computer to it and access my home network via a wireless link to the WRT600N, but what I want to do is hook it up (therj45 on the WGA600N) to the extra port (10/100/1000 wired) on my router (which goes upstairs) and use the wireless antenna on it as my wireless point of entry into my network. </s>
<s> I would disable the wireless on the router. </s>
<s> this would give me farther range on my wireless network because it would be places up high in my home. </s>
<s> Would this work? </s>
<s> Is there a way to do what I'm asking?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Try POST 17 of our forum sticky and you can leave the wifi enabled on the router in the basement. </s>
<s> --&gt; I've never read that we put it as high as possible. </s>
<s> That's news to me. </s>
<s> I have read to not put it in basements and that &quot;centrally located&quot; advice numerous times. </s>
