Today I'm going to buy a mini drive card to convert an old IDE 40GB drive to a SATA.
This is my primary drive and I don't want to loss data.
Whats the risk?
Since this basically will just boost the connection speed for the drive, I'd think little risk maybe 20%.
I need a second, third, fourth opinion.
