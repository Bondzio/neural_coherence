As previously indicated .... AMD has many CPUs...case in point THERE ARE TWO AM2 X2 4400s ... which ONE comes with your system ?
The 89W or 65W CPU ?
Or the 65nm or 90nm technology ?
2200Mhz or 2300Mhz ?
2MB Cache or 1MB cache ?

It's often the case you can upgrade to a faster CPU for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying.
Can't figure why you're putting such a low-end CPU in an otherwise high-end system ?
