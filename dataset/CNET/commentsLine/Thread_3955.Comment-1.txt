yesterday, my little daughter dropped my memory stick and it probably didn't work any longer.
it was recognized on my computer.
but, every time i tried to open it, it could give me a message and asked me to format it at first.
but, when i attempted to format it, the computer would tell me the formatting process could not be finished.
is there any way to retrieve all my files on this memory stick?
i still have something important on it.
any idea could be appreciated.
