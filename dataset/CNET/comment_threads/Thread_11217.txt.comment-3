The rich & famous?
Or regular people who are just barely trying to scrape by, ever since the world has become so runaway high-tech filled with ever more toxic junk from the east?
Even CNET (believe it or not) posted something about it: http://www.cnet.com/4520-6022_1-105148-1.html Also see Etoxics.org Toxics In Electronics: http://www.etoxics.org/site/PageServer?pagename=svtc_toxics_in_electronics And why should something need to be overpriced just to be non-toxic?
Ditto for &quot;health foods&quot;.
Once upon a time, &quot;natural flavoring&quot; was par for the course at your local market.
Nowadays, natural flavoring is considered a health-food item.
Does that make sense?
Maybe to you (judging by your above post).
Not to me.
