1.1.1	When I was close to buying a PC about 4-6 months ago I watched this forum very closely and through a lot of various posts , quetions etc eventually it seemed to be the overall opinion that in terms of memory 512mb was the bare minimum , and one should go for 1.0gb if possible .	St
1.1.2	PLUS it was noted that stepping up to 2.0 MB did not & quot ; get & quot ; you that much more .	St
1.1.3	NOW FOR THE 'DUMB ' QUESTION : A lot of those comments were around single core processors ( the Intel 500 's and 600 's or AMD 3200 , 3300 etc ) .	St
1.1.4	Now that since then Dual Core has really hit the market , and if were to get one I most likely would get a Intel 800 series , does the 1GB comment still apply , or since I have DUAL core do I now need 2.0gb .	St
1.1.5	I KNOW obviously 2.0gb is always better than 1.0gb , my question is if 1.0gb was enough before , with dual core does that mean I should for the msot part assume I need 2.0gb .	St
1.1.6	I told youthis may be a stupid question , so I apologize if it is .	St
1.1.7	By the way , the use of the PC will be for internet , digital photos , basic home video editing and dvd burning , very little gaming and I would bet no major games ( HL2 etc )	St
1.2.1	I have 1 GB , works great .	St
1.2.2	OK , to your question .	St
1.2.3	No , it does n't mean that jumping to 2.0GB will be noticeable just because you have 2 cores.. Not that many programs can even fully utilize those cores , games MIGHT give you an extra fps or two .	St
1.2.4	1.0 GB will suffice for a long time ...	St
1.2.5	In 5 years , 2.0 GB MIGHT be on the recommened specs of something powerful like video encoding , but 1.0 will suit you fine .	St
1.2.6	I have a few friends who took the leap to 1.5 and they said they had a noticeable difference .	St
1.2.7	Noticeable , but slightly .	St
1.2.8	hth -Ibrahim P.S .	St
1.2.9	Every Benchmark I 've seen : AMD is on the throne of dual-core .	St
1.2.10	I 'm not fanboy , I have an intel in all my computers , all nine of them .	St
1.2.11	But my next purchase will indefinitely be an AMD product .	St
