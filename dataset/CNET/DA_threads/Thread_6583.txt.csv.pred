1.1.1	I've got a new PC: HP Pavilion 1630n.	St
1.1.2	ADSL is connected with a copperjet 810 modem using my LAN.	St
1.1.3	Now I would like to share the ADSL with 2 more computers, but my ethernet port is taken by the modem.	St
1.1.4	Question is: Can I install a second ethernet card in my machine, and connect the two other computers with a crossover cable (via a US Robotics Broadband Router) If the answer is Yes, please specify what Ethernet Card is needed.	St
1.1.5	Your advice will be cert much appreciated Regards Leo	Polite
1.2.1	but I might use a router for sharing and Internet use.	St
1.3.1	Thanks michael.	St
1.3.2	My ISP installed the copperjet 810 modem, so I have no choice.	St
1.3.3	Leo	St
1.4.1	http://forums.speedguide.net/showthread.php?t=197267 Tadah!	St
1.4.2	Heck, I could even do that.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Do you mean that you cannot unplug the cable from the ethernet card and then plug into a router, then plug a new cable between the router and the ethernet card?	St
1.5.2	I'm very confused by your response?!	St
1.5.3	?	Ques
1.6.1	kwkid sorry to confuse you.	Polite
1.6.2	Let me try to explain: My old PC was connected with an Alcatel Speedtouch USB.	St
1.6.3	I had my ethernet card free to connect to 2 other computers.	St
1.6.4	I had a crossover cable running from my PC to a US Robotics Broadband Router placed in another room 20 yards away.	St
1.6.5	From there 2 straight cables were connected to the other 2 computers.	St
1.6.6	This setup worked fine.	St
1.6.7	When needed I also could unplug the crosscable from my machine to connect a laptop.	St
1.6.8	In the current situation my ISP connected my new PC with a Copperjet 810 LAN connection.	St
1.6.9	(The technician informed me that they were replacing all Alcatels with Copperjets) Fine, but now my ethernet port needed for my network is taken.	St
1.6.10	So all I want now is a free ethernet port to continue with what I was doing before.	St
1.6.11	I was not sure if a second ethernet card would do the job, so I posted in the forum to hear from the experts.	St
1.6.12	I hope You ain't confused anymore.	St
1.6.13	I appreciate your help.	Polite
1.6.14	Regards Leo	St
1.7.1	http://www.csolutions.net/cdsl/pdf/InstallationManual.pdf#search=%22Copperjet%20810%20LAN%20connection%22 I see you only need to plug the other machine into the copperjet.	St
1.7.2	No extra card is required.	St
1.7.3	Unless there is something you are doing that you didn't share, you are good to go.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	Bob The other thing is: Now and then I connect a laptop to my machine.	St
1.8.2	Therefore I assume I need an ethernet port.	St
1.8.3	Unless you tell me your secret how to do it otherwise.	Sug
1.8.4	Leo	St
1.9.1	You have enough ports to go round without doing much else.	St
1.9.2	Just take time to sort out the new setup.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Because the cables and the router from the old setting are allready installed.	St
1.10.2	Please take notice that the router is not in my room, so if I need to connect a laptop (any laptop from friends who drop in) to my PC, I will need a port.	St
1.10.3	I thought that a second ethernet card would solve my problem, but I wasn't sure, that's the reason for my visit to this forum.	St
1.10.4	So please tell me if my proposed setup will work.	Ques
1.10.5	I appreciate to learn better methods.	Polite
1.10.6	so I may consider those for future use.	St
1.10.7	Bob thank you for responding Leo	Polite
1.11.1	It's rough on some owners.	St
1.11.2	I paid less than 20 for a switched hub that I have in my travel bag.	St
1.11.3	Since you have to buy another ethernet card why not just use a small switched hub this time?	Sug
1.11.4	Certainly a lot easier than slugging it out with ICS.	St
1.11.5	Bob	St
1.12.1	tell me more about your switched hub.	Sug
1.12.2	I will tell you another secret: I got the new PC for my 80th birthday Leo	St
1.13.1	http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?InvtId=A-8309&cpc=RECOM Sorry I don't see the small one I picked up earlier.	St
1.13.2	Bob	St
1.14.1	for encouraging me to find a solution without installing a second ethernet card.	St
1.14.2	Everything is working fine Regards Leo	St
1.15.1	The 2 network card setup while possible can be hours or weeks to get working (depending on skill and luck) where the switched hub should just plug and play.	St
1.15.2	Sorry I didn't find the smaller one but you seem to catch one quick and nail this issue fast.	St
1.15.3	Best of continued (self made) luck, Bob	St
