1.1.1	I 'd like to know what I need to do to wire my home .	St
1.1.2	I 'd like each room of my house to have an ethernet jack where I can plug into my local network AND connect to the Internet .	St
1.1.3	A standard router only has 4 ports and I need many more ports ( i.e .	St
1.1.4	20 ) than that .	St
1.1.5	A switch has many more ports , but I 've read that switches are only good to connect to a network ; they are n't good to connect the devices to the Internet .	St
1.1.6	My internet comes from a cable modem .	St
1.1.7	Ideally I would like to connect all the wires to a central ( 1000Mbps capable ) switch/hub/router in my basement ( so all the wires are kept out of sight ) .	St
1.1.8	Whatever is used as the central hub , I 'd like to connect my cable modem to that device .	St
1.1.9	( I do n't want to use a computer has a gateway . )	St
1.1.10	I 'd also like to make sure my wireless router ( used for my laptop and other wireless devices ) is kept on the 1st floor for easy access and better reception .	St
1.1.11	So what combination of routers , hubs , switches , cable modem , etc do I need to wire my home ?	Ques
1.1.12	p.s .	St
1.1.13	the wired devices I would like to connect are : 2 or more desktop computers , 2 networked HDHomerun dual TV tuners ( potentially more ) , printers , game consoles , Media Center Extenders , Internet capable TVs potentially in the future , maybe a home server in the future , possibly more devices that have yet to be created at this time .	St
1.1.14	Thanks in advance for the help .	St
1.2.1	I 'd say you may need a switch , router and an AP .	St
1.2.2	This depends on where your cable enters the house and your modem is placed .	St
1.2.3	The basic connection sequence will be PC to switch to router to modem to outside cable .	St
1.2.4	The switch will connect to one LAN port on the router and all wired devices can connect to it or other free ports on the router .	St
1.2.5	IP addressing from the router can pass through the switch .	St
1.2.6	Since you want the major hardware in the basement , your wireless radio device should probably be an AP .	St
1.2.7	The AP can connect to the switch or a free port on the router .	St
1.2.8	In this case , your router does n't need to be of the wireless type but might be handy if you bring a laptop into the basement .	St
1.2.9	Two wireless radios do add extra steps , however .	St
1.2.10	You said you need 20 ports .	St
1.2.11	You 'll find switches that offer 16 and 24 ports so you 'll go with 24 .	St
1.2.12	The four on your router add two more for a total of 26 possible terminal connections as one switch port and router port will be connected .	St
1.2.13	If you want to go gigabit capable , you 'll need to make sure that your switch and wiring are proper .	St
1.2.14	In wall wiring should be Cat6 ( though Cat5e may work ) and so must patch cables to all devices capable of that speed .	St
1.2.15	The router speed wo n't matter and neither will the AP as these only provide WAN connections and you wo n't see gigabit to/from there .	St
1.2.16	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	Can the AP ( Wireless Access Point ) instead be a wireless router .	St
1.3.2	Is there a problem connecting 2 routers together ?	Ques
1.4.1	What I have read and at least understand is that anything connected to the switch will NOT be connected to the Internet .	St
1.4.2	Is that not true if the switch is connected to a router which is connected to the Internet ?	Ques
1.5.1	Many wireless routers can be used as bridges or APs .	St
1.5.2	You 'd need to check your manual to see if yours can do such .	Sug
1.5.3	I believe there in information in the forum & quot ; sticky & quot ; about .	St
1.5.4	It 's often cited as the first place to go before posting questions but I 've not read the entirety of it .	St
1.5.5	A wireless router may be a combination of several devices .	St
1.5.6	A router which connects to another network , a DHCP server , a switch and a wireless radio can all be integrated into one box .	St
1.5.7	A router wired router with multiple ports can serve as just a switch .	St
1.5.8	It 's a matter of not using the WAN port and turning off the DHCP server function .	St
1.5.9	What you do n't want is two DHCP servers on your network .	St
1.6.1	Well , you can but you 'll only be able to connect one device .	St
1.6.2	You connect the router to the modem and then the switch to the router .	St
1.6.3	All of your other devices go to the switch or additional LAN ports on the router .	St
1.6.4	The switch keeps some sort of MAC address table ( magic to me ) and controls traffic to and from individual devices in an efficient manner that avoids the collisions common with dumb hubs .	St
1.6.5	These hubs toss the data up for grabs and let the receiving devices determine what 's meant for them .	St
1.6.6	Smart hubs , switches , whatever , do n't do that .	St
1.6.7	You want a good switch but I do n't see too many dumb hubs out there anymore .	St
1.6.8	In any event , traffic meant for the internet ( WAN ) will be directed by the switch to the router and then to the modem which is connected to your ISP server .	St
1.6.9	Your ISP takes it from there .	St
