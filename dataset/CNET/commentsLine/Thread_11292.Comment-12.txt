don't worry about anything else.
the only thing that should be connected to your mac is your keyboard and mouse.
no internet; no printers; no blue-tooth; no external hard drives; no modems; no cameras; no ipods or mp3's; absolutely nothing!!
just do as mrmacfixit just said.
you mentioned that you are running -or want to run- os 10.1.4 on a imac dual processor.
if that's correct, then it's not going to work, period.
as stated, use only the disks that came with the machine first.
don't do anything fancy like you said earlier -free bsd, connecting to the net, etc.- just be sure you have your mouse and keyboard plugged in and you are using the original disk (grey in colour) that came with that mac.
sorry to get on your case but as to what i can remember and to what i see, when i mounted xp and then vista, it requested that you had an internet connection.
that's a windows thing; not macs.
if you use windows methods, you'll develop grey hairs and wrinkles and probably go bald.
