<s> I currently have 4gb of DDR2 ram, and an ATI Radeon 4650 HD, and I wanted to know if i can upgrade it to 8gb DDR3 ram or stick with DDR2, and also, to what GPU can I get the motherboard to. </s>
<s> I have a 2.33 GHZ Quad Core, and my power supply is a Micronics 230W. </s>
<s> I play games such as the AC series, Tomb Raider amongst others, high motion games. </s>
<s> 2 hours ago Also, I want to know if i will need to upgrade my power source </s>
<s> I'd say do nothing. </s>
<s> There are posts about which list to check but in this case not only would you be in for a new GPU but without a new PSU I'd not touch this. </s>
<s> I'd leave this alone. </s>

<s> But if i upgrade my PSU to say, 500 watts? </s>
<s> Because you might get some dual or triple rail PSU and that would be no upgrade. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html is the usual list. </s>
<s> And look at the rating needed and then again, unless you know your Amperes, you get a single rail of the rated value. </s>

<s> So i guess it's better to buy a new PC than to try and improve my current one </s>
<s> But it won't affect frame rates in games. </s>
<s> If you found this old PC with say a 5400 RPM drive, for cheap I could fit a 7200 RPM drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit. </s>
<s> The 230W PSU is just too low to consider any card on the list. </s>
<s> And without knowing which 500W you have so I can check rails, I can't be sure it will do. </s>
<s> That's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail. </s>
