Hi, I have a few months old Western Digital WD1600AAJS 160GB internal hdd.
Sometimes when i power up my system and just when the hard drive spins up, i hear few(4-5) slight cliks from the hard drive.
After that everything works fine, no system lockups and no noises from the drive.
Please let me know if this is normal for my drive?
