<s> I am getting conflicting advise on wireless networking. </s>
<s> I have 2 Dell Dimension desktops WIRED (one upstairs, one downstairs) and 1 brand new Inspiron Notebook WIRELESS with a 1450 wireless card attached to a new Dell TrueMobile 2300. </s>
<s> I cannot receive a good signal more than 15 feet away from the router in my house. </s>
<s> It's on the top floor and I can not go farther than the next room, not to mention downstairs to the bedrooms or family room. </s>
<s> This is a regular house........average sized, no steel walls or anything....just wood and sheetrock with lots of wide open spaces. </s>
<s> Is there a more powerful router to buy? </s>
<s> What are repeaters, antennas, bridges, access points or airports and would any of them work for me? </s>
<s> Each person at Dell I speak to has a different opinion! </s>
<s> Help? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I couldn't see what wireless router you have but let me comment on 2 items. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I ran into a person who had a wireless router and the antennas were missing. </s>
<s> &quot;It should work without them was what the salesperson told me.&quot;!!! </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The last dozen routers didn't have the latest firmware and had range issues (4 to 10 feet!) </s>
