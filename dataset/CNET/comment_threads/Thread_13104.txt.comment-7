I just looked up that Netgear router that you mentioned, and see that I've already seen it on CNET's reviews ( http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wndr3700-rangemax-dual/4505-3319_7-33485574.html ).
They considered it to be very good, but on the negative side they said that the N-band performance &quot;... is disappointing.&quot; Do you have that same experience?
