Does anyone know about this website? The tablet has decent specs, dual core 1.6ghz, 16 gig, 1024x768, dual cameras, etc., etc. At this point is the hardware secondary to the operating system? Would it be foolish to purchase this over the smaller nexus 7 which has a higher pricepoint? Are we at a point with tablets, which PCs reached some time ago, that branding shouldn't matter?
