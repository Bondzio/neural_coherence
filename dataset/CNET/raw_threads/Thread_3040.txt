If you created 2 partitions, you should see 2 different drive letters. Is that the case? If you have more than one partition, your BIOS is still only going to report the HD full size and not that of the partitions Windows sees. Perhaps you did create a 912Mb partition on the 502Gb drive.

The issue I cna't format G: because I shall loose the data. THANK YOU so much for your answer!!!

Instead of using explorer, look at what disk management says. It will list by partition with drive letter and also show a crude map of your physical drives. That map will contain partition information for each drive and will also show any unallocated space.
