hi jmarchi, the reason for the purchase was to simply add more usefulness from the scanner.
i am an editor for an eaa chapter newsletter.
sometimes i actually get input from our members, but the information may be from newspaper or magazine articles and when i tried to use the software that came with the scanner, lots of data was replaced with junk or lost altogether.
a trip to our local computer repair shop/store for answers led to the software purchase.
only problem was, i didn't know what to do with it.
should i take the oem software out, should i simply scan to the other program or what?
well, i'm here now for the answers.
the computer shop is long gone, and other places don't like to answer questions unless you want to buy something from them.
