1.1.1	The internal CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive ( CRX810E ) in my older ( 4 years old ) Sony Viao Notebook ( PCG-GRX550 ) recently started acting up .	St
1.1.2	If I insert any kind of CD or DVD into the drive it thinks it is an audio CD .	St
1.1.3	If I try to play the CD ( even audio CDs ) or DVD the drive spins for a while and then fails to read anything .	St
1.1.4	I looked under the properties for the drive and everything seems to be okay .	St

1.6.1	Hey Dgogoi , I have the exact same problem with my Sony Viao ( now 2 years old ) that you did .	St
1.6.2	Did you end up getting a new DVD-rom , if so which one and did it work out all right ?	Ques
1.6.3	I 'm also curious if you had any trouble switching them out .	St
1.6.4	I took a look at mine , and it did n't look like the removal/installation was anywhere near as straight-forward as with most laptops .	St

1.7.1	I have the same CD R/W / DVD combo drive and have had a hell of a time with it !	St
1.7.2	From incorrect copying of my files , to not alowing me to R/W my R/W disk , to not recognizing my R and R/W disk , not to mention the failure to play all regions formated DVDs .	St
1.7.3	I am seriously considering getting an external replacement drive and uninstalling this God Damned combo drive and throwing it in the garbage heap of all the other poorly designed drives and P.C .	St
1.7.4	devices .	St
1.7.5	Combo drives at this point in time are imperfect at best useless at worst .	St
1.7.6	The problem is Laptops and Notebooks rarely can handle more then one CD ROM/DVD ROM Drives , so unless you dare try to find a non-combo drive that will be compatiable with your Laptop and not require A+ Certification to install , an external drive ( s ) are your best bet .	St
1.7.7	Windows default drivers are often troblesome and very often not compatiable with your devices .	St
1.7.8	Sometimes your device ( s ) will work but not to their full potential because of imperfectly matched and/or outdated drivers ( such as the CD part of your drive working but not the CD/R and CD/RW part ) .	St
1.7.9	Uninstall your combo drive and get an external DVD R/W drive ( if money is an issue try E-Bay or if you prefer new , Comp USA is a good choice http : //www.compusa.com .	St
1.7.10	Good luck and damn Sony and their expensive and buggy computers and devices .	St
