emm, i put everything to auto in the bios config.
when i bought the memory sticks, i just picked ddr800 and didn't bother with the clock cycles and other stuff that i didn't really care.
i was assuming my mother board (p5ql/epu) is fine with any thing from ddr667 to ddr1066.
here is the model number on the memory stick in case needed: kvr800d2n6/2g 2gb pc2-6400 cl6 240 pin dimm thanks
