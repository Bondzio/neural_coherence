more to the point seagate with 5 year warranty.
i've been using these drives for a long time.
to get the 5 year warranty one has to purchase enterprise class drives or retail box drives that are labeled &quot;5 year warranty.&quot; seagate also sells drives with 1 and 3 year warranties, mostly into the oem and external markets.
maxtor is now owned by seagate.
still only carries a 3 year warranty on retail packaging..
