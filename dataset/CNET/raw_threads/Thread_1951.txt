Fact is, each company makes a line of monitors and any one may be better than any other one, depending on what you spend and how high you go in the quality of the monitor. You want a high contrast ratio, that is one of the main numbers to go by, another one is the Warranty, get a 3 year FACTORY warranty. If you really want help on specific brands then tell us EXACTLY which model you are looking for in each brand.

While the study was done by some that produce a competing technology, the brutal truth is that I'm already seeing the LCD displays age as you see at http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1153387,00.asp &quot;DMD panels are immune to aging and image deterioration effects seen with other technologies, such as CRTs and plasma displays, or even LCDs.&quot; You may be non-plused to find out that even your highest quality LCD display will have issues in just a few years. If quality and lifespan is an issue, you don't want a LCD. Bob

The better mfr's now include the response time as one of the specifications. Some report a single value, some give both the ON and the OFF time. [can turn solid state devices ON faster than turn them OFF]
