<s> I bought a new computer yesterday, and thus had to buy a video capture card (ATI Wonder 650) that is compatible with Vista. </s>
<s> I have a $300 outdoor security camera that I plug into the capture cards composite input and have a program I bought that records upon motion detection, and can stream video to a web site (Active Webcam is the program). </s>
<s> Everything works fine until I use the TV Tuner on the same card. </s>
<s> The cam image then changes to the TV Chanel I am watching. </s>
<s> But if I close the cam program and open it again, it changes the TV Tuner channel to display the cam feed. </s>
<s> So I can only view one or the other. </s>
<s> This never happened before. </s>
<s> I don't know what to do. </s>
<s> I think it is to do with the way the card sends video to the programs. </s>
<s> In the webcam software, it is using Direct Show, the Video Device is set to &quot;ATI AVStream Anolog Capture&quot; and the Video Source is &quot;Composite 1&quot; (from the availible option of TV Tuner, Composite 1, and S-Video [the three inputs from the card]). </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Seems right. </s>
<s> I decline to offer more than the video decoder/encoder has just one input. </s>
<s> Again, it's that simple so I decline to write a tutorial about this. </s>
<s> &quot;This never happened before.&quot; Since you changed machines and video capture card you may have to explore redeploying the machine that worked ok. </s>
<s> That's messed up, they should at least tell you something like &quot;Can only use one input at a time&quot; on the box, or at least have it so it switches back to the security camera after watching TV. </s>
