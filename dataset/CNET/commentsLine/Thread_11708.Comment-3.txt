hi, thanks for the info it's been very helpful and about my budget, i could probably spend around $2300 so what do you think about this setup than: e6850 3.0 4mb/1333mhz (ah what about q6600 2.4 8mb/1066mhz does this make a big difference) p5k deluxe, p5k3 deluxe, p5k premium and the p5k3 deluxe i got them at more or less the same price around $235 (i'm planing to make a slight overclock nothing extreme) 8800gtx/768mb where i am buying my stuff they dont have the 512mb only 8800gtx and 8800gts 640mb so it's between this two.
