Suspect the SW would run just fine with a better video ... the only problem may be finding an 8800 series equivalent or better card with 256 RAM that doesn't require a more robust power supply.
Before going further, fully explore both upgrade and new PC options.
All things considered, it may be best to look at new PC (NOT A SLIMLINE) that meets or exceeds the spec.
