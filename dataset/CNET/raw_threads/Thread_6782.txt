You can get a nForce4 chipset, socket 939 board for the same price. Also, you can get socket 939 Athlon64 3000+ (w/HSF) for less than your Barton. Athlon64 939 3200+ for a little more.

A Socket A motherboard has 462 pin holes for insertion of a 462 pin CPU, such as the Athlon XP 3200+ CPU. Socket 939 has, you guessed it, 939 pin holes for a 939 pin processor. Socket 939 motherboards support todays best AMD processors Socket 939 motherboards support todays dual core AMD processors. Socket A technology in the Athlon XP 3200+ is old. In fact it is three generations old: Oldest --&gt; Socket A --&gt; Socket 940, --&gt; Socket 754 --&gt; Socket 939 --&gt; Newest Athlon 64 CPUs (not available in Socket A) support 64-bit Windows OS and other programs. Among other advantages, Athlon64s have newer instruction sets, meaning that they will be compatible with more new software enhancements longer. When it doesnt cost any more to get the Socket 939 Athlon64 processor, there is no reason to get a Socket A AthlonXP or a Socket 754 Athlon64, unless you already have a great Socket A or Socket 754 motherboard that just needs a CPU. You can get a Socket 939 Athlon64 for less than the $160 you have indicated you might spend.

You don't necessarily have build the same machine, but the article will give you an idea of what to look for and why. Heres their High End Gaming PC Google &quot;gaming pc&quot; or &quot;gaming computer&quot; and see what gaming computer companies (not Dell, Compaq, or Gateway) and hobbyists are using for graphics cards on their low, midrange, and high-end gaming computers. Pay attention to the interface-- AGP is not the same as PCI Express (PCI-X16). The motherboard you select has to have a slot that is compatible with your video card. As stated previously, a socket 939 motherboard with a PCI Express graphics slot should keep up with the latest games for the quite some time.
