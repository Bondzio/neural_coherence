Now that it has a warranty it's time to use it.
But I wonder what the real problems are.
The post was very unclear with notes about broken stuff which I took to be as something an abusive owner might do to their machine.
We see those at the shop all the time with hammer marks on cases or when the owner &quot;kicked the machine to make it start.&quot; -&gt; We know that bad IDE devices can stop a machine from showing the BIOS screen so it looks like you have bad components to remove still.
