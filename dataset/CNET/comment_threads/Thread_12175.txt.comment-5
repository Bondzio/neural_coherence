I'll look up SYNCBACK.
I understand the final backup should be 'once only use' CD's.
Mainly I would like a copy of this computer because I can't remember all the programs & 100's of hours of updates to goodness knows what that just happen of their own volitition.
I wouldn't know where to start to discribe what's on this computer (I've totally lost track!).
So figured a copy would at least give me a starting point should this machine go AWOL.
