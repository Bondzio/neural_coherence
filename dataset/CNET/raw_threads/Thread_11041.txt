Make sure the printer is in &quot;Copy Mode.&quot; 2. Press the &quot;Menu&quot; button once. 3. The screen will display &quot;COPY MENU: Copies&quot;. 4. Press the left arrow button once. The screen will display &quot;COPY MENU: Tools&quot;. 5. Press the check button once. The screen with read &quot;Tools: Maintenance&quot;. 6. Press the check button once. The screen with read &quot;Maintenance: Ink Levels&quot;. 7. Press the right arrow button until the screen reads &quot;Maintenance: Print Test Page&quot;. 8. Press the check button once. This will start the Self-Test. Once the page has printed, the printer will stop. The test is not continuous. The self-test should at least print out a set of either a solid black or solid color bars, but the top portion will contain info on your printer. Get a fax number from tech support and fax that info to them. They'll be able to determine what's wrong from that info. I'm on my second X5470, and it's giving me the same problem as the first (sounds like it's trying to turn on for no apparent reason). Needless to say I'm not a happy camper. Must admit Lexmark sent me a replacement quickly, but what good is that when I have the same problems with the new unit? Good luck!
