Called up ECS and they said they will NOT warranty the board because it's a discontinued board. Unfortunately for me, the company I bought it from has gone out of business. So, what am I supposed to do? I called ECS, but they don't want to stand behind their products. Anyone else have this kind of issue? I hope not! Thanks Tim Shanks

Then send it to PC World, PC Mag, the Better Business Bureau in the state where ECS (USA) is located and anyone and anywhere you can post it in user forums ... even on the ECS site if they support user comments. Newegg is another place you might be able to post it...just make sure you make it clear the problem is with ECS and NOT NEWEGG. In the interim ..get another MB with a better mfg warranty. Let us know if ECS mends their ways. VAPCMD

Wonder if it would make a difference that the woman was hard to understand on the phone? After I got my response from ECS yesterday, I took and sent an email to their MB sales, and the corp sales email addresses. Maybe someone in those departments can help. It makes me wonder how many others are out there that have the same issue as I have ran into. I can understand that if I didn't have the proof of purchase, that they wouldn't warranty their products. And unfortunately, I don't have the manuals anymore, but IF I recall correctly, I believe their warranty states ''1 yr from date of purchase''. Well, normally in the business/retail world, ''the customer is always right''... Must not apply to ECS??? Thanks Tim

User was able to get the OS installed and running but the system wouldn't reliably find the HDDs during reboot/post. ASUS furnished a replacement MB (older revision) but it did exactly same thing... when the second MB went back ASUS said the they wouldn't replace it because of &quot;user damage&quot;. Later at a PC show a vendor indicated that that specific MB was plagued with problems and they didn't carry it any longer. The purchaser bought another brand MB (MSI) and the system booted up 'as is' with installing any new drivers and ran the OS like the MB had never been changed. My advice....pursue it 'til you get an answer in writing. The written word is hard evidence... the spoken word is easily misunderstood and denied. Let us know VAPCMD
