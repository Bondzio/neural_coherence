<s> So i have an older Dell desktop and am very broke (imma 21 year old starting out a business and a college student). </s>
<s> I am having trouble booting up i turn it on and it says i hav e a low power supply and then i have to press F1 and then i have to choose Windows XP (ive had to do both of those for ages. </s>
<s> But the thing is when it usually boots up to y desktop is flashes a blue screen then restarts this process and is very aggrevating. </s>
<s> So any feedback is highly appreciated. </s>
<s> What voltage does that CMOS battery measure with a Volt Meter? </s>
<s> How old is that battery? </s>
