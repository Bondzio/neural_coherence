the limit of ram that can be addressed will usually be between 3 and 4 gigabytes, depending on how much address space is taken up by other hardware (e.g.
graphics card).
so you might, for example, be able to access 3.5gb out of your 4gb using a 32-bit win xp installation (as in my case).
so there is a benefit to 3 over 4, but it is slight, especially since many programs can't make use of that level of ram.
also, you'll still own the hardware, so you could upgrade your os and presumably get the full benefit later, although i doubt many people will do that.
