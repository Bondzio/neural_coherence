Only problem is, I don't know a whole lot about computers as far as compatibility goes with the hardware. So I'm getting my computer off a site and I'll just list what I have in the works and if anybody has free time, I'd appreciate the input. 600 Watt -- Power Supply SLI Ready Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q6600 (4x 2.4GHz/8MB L2 Cache/1066FSB) OR Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6850 (2x 3.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache/1333FSB) Extreme-Performance INTEL CPU Cooling Fan System Kit Asus P5N-E SLI nForce 650i SLI Chipset w/6-channel CODEC, Gb LAN, S-ATA Raid, USB 2.0, IEEE-1394 Dual PCI-E MB 2048MB [1024MB X2] DDR2-800 PC6400 Memory Module NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT 512MB yeah...thats it..and a cd drive which i know will work.

It's $50 after rebates at newegg.com last i checked. I also suggest looking at the new E8xx core 2 duos. This seems more like a budget gaming system, and will handle most games, good luck.

I have ALSA, aRTS, Pulseaudio, and OSS running. I have a SB card. I can run multiple streams on it. Much more than a game on any Windows platform. You're worried about drivers and support? Build the drivers ans database for the hardware.

All that with what i listed in my first post came to a bit over 800, with shipping 900. But I suppose if money is the problem here, I could just buy the pc and use the speakers/mouse/keyboard i have now and gradually upgrade.

9362	10	295376	2778766	2778365	ramarc	5/22/08 11:39 AM	1.21145634E12	don't go to best buy for graphics card or cooling fan	you'll overpay unless you catch a great sale. if by &quot;disk tray&quot; you mean cd/dvd burner, then best buy will be competitive. if want a 8800gt, this one is hard to beat since it includes a game and is only $154 before $30 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125089 here's a good cooler for $30: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134

If you just have to have an SLI motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45NM like this board here http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131232 A good Intel board with a single 16x PCIe slot Gigabyte (GIGABYTE GA-EP35-DS3L) will do the trick. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128337 The Palit 9600GT will play modern games 5x better than the 8500GT will and it's affordable. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814261002
