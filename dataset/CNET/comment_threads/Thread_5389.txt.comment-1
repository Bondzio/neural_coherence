Two of the three Optoma EP720 projectors we run in our training rooms have recently started displaying badly pixelated images, one worse than the other and the third is OK.
I have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy!
To prove the issue, I finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image' is still badly pixelated.
To my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop.
The possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on Monday!!!!
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
