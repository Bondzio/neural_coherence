i didn't see that router in your posts.
the issue is sadly being copied it seems to other routers so when i look into this i bring another router.
as to you suspicion i can't tell you if that hurts.
the most common issue i encounter is moochers.
before that were routers that the old vista broadcast flag issue would cause issues.
the moochers still are out there and the broadcast flag is easy to research and resolve.
but if you find a router that has that issue you update it or toss it (in my opinion.)
