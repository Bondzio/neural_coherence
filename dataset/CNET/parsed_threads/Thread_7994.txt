<s> can I connect my keyboard to the computer and play with its sounds with no delay? </s>
<s> i assume we're talking about a midi keyboard. </s>
<s> check the midi ports on your keyboard and your pc. </s>
<s> if you have pro-style midi (round plug) you'll should get a usb midi adapter and not fiddle with the sound card's port. </s>
<s> if you have a db plug (semi-rectangular) the keyboard may plug into your sound/game card's midi. </s>
<s> you'll also need some sequencing software. </s>
<s> as for the delay, if you attach directly to a sound card there's typically no delay. </s>
<s> usb can introduce a delay, but it can be minimized by using a usb-2 device and plugging it directly into the pc (not a hub). </s>
<s> if you have lots of usb devices, find a usb port that can provide full power since it typically won't be on a shared host. </s>
