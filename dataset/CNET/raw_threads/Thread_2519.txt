After wasting an hour and one half I discarded it and loaded the drivers and other stuff from disc using the big bulky parallel? cable. It went flawlessly. Is the USB cable really to connect printer and computer or for something else?

Today's consumers didn't expect this. Bob

Can't understand why canon provides parallel and USB connections on back of printer and then it's impossible to set up the printer for USB using their supplied disc. Even tried web page driver download with similar lack of success. Now have spare USB cord.

Many consumers are ill prepared for USB issues. There's not much more I can offer with what you have written. And you didn't exclaim &quot;OMG!&quot; with all the USB madness there is with all the chipset issues out there. Just because a camera works means nothing. USBMAN sheds light on this. Bob

A repeating issue for Windows owners is that USB doesn't mean it works. http://www.usbman.com covers most reasons, but here's the two I see a lot. First the USB ports must be enabled in the BIOS, second many machines require motherboard or USB drivers that are not supplied by Microsoft. A new annoyance is that Microsoft offers a driver through Windows Update that is inferior to what the vendor/maker offers. With what information you supplied, only this generic advice can be offered. You have to research USBMAN because I don't duplicate web content in the forums. Bob
