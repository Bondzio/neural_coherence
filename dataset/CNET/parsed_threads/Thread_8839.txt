<s> Here's a weird one. </s>
<s> I've had an HP PSC 1210 All-in-one printer/copier for about 5 years. </s>
<s> About a week ago, it kept getting jammed everytime I tried to print/copy with it. </s>
<s> I went through HP tech support page, and it told me to uninstall the software and reinstall. </s>
<s> I tried that, but everytime it got to the end of the installation process (the part where you plug in the USB cable) it didn't recognize the printer. </s>
<s> I tried EVERYTHING to fix this, including: - Multiple uninstalls followed by reinstalls - Unplugging everything from every port and receptacle and waiting - Downloading updated drivers from HP - Turning off my antivirus and firewall during installation - Running Windows update - Trying different USB ports and chords - Reinstalling the USB drivers to the mobo - Following the damn troubleshooting tips on HP - Talking to an HP troubleshooter over tech support chat Nothing works. </s>
<s> This printer was perfect a few weeks ago, and now its own drivers don't recognize it. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> PS - Here are my specs: Windows XP Professional SP3, Pentium D 3.24gh, 2 gb of ram, homebuilt PC with a Gigabyte 81945gzme-rh mobo </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Test the printer on another PC. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try another USB cable. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> &quot;- Reinstalling the USB drivers to the mobo&quot; Instead, install the motherboard CHIPSET DRIVER PACKAGE. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> the program requires the printer to be connected to the PC before installing the software/ drivers. </s>
<s> Actually, it doesn't. </s>
<s> the installation package makes it really clear that you shouldn't attach it until prompted. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback, all. </s>
<s> None of it worked, but i appreciate the gesture. </s>
