I have been experiencing problems, and I am not sure what it is. I have copied some DVD's of mine with no problems, and burned some data discs with no problems. It seems that the problem only occurs when making DVD Movie's. Nero works fine until the very end. It burns about 4.4GB out of the 4.6 and then has an error and stops. I saved the Nero Logs from two seperate burns and they are different, although they have the same characteristics: burns about 4.4GB then stops and a error message comes up. In one of the logs, it says: [17:12:16] NeroVision ???? 05:12:08
