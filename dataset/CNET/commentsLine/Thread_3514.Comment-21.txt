'' so can i assume that this means any standard atx board will fit into my case?''
not necessarily.
look on p.12 of the technical information pdf.
section ''1.1 overview'' says the motherboard was made in microatx (9.6'' x 9.6'') and full atx (12.0'' x 9.6'') sizes.
which one do you have?
you could put a microatx board in a number of standard case sizes, but you can't put a full atx board in the smaller atx cases.
if you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent cpu (p4, athlon 64, dual cores), the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well.
this includes the power supply unit (psu).
new components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling, fit larger fans, accommodate larger heatsinks, et al.
there are good deals on new cases that come with psu's.
