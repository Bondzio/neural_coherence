If this burner has worked in this configuration before, you may have a hardware problem with the drive.
If it has not worked before then you may need PatchBurn 3.1 ( http://www.patchburn.de/ ) or an update to Toast Titanium.
Current version of Toast is 6.1.1 What happens when you insert a blank disk into the 109 without launching Toast first?
Unless you have not set a default action, the Finder should ask you what you want to do with this blank disk.
If the Finder is not recognizing blank Media, PatchBurn will solve that problem and then you can move on with further troubleshooting.
You might try repairing permissions too.
I know it doesn't seem to be connected but strange things happen when they are not right.
Hope some of this helps P
