1.1.1	Hi , I recently got a Dell e196fp flat panel monitor at work .	St
1.1.2	While its size impressed me , I have n't been able to get the desired display from it ( nothing close to my old CRT monitor ) .	St
1.1.3	The monitor 's default is 1280x1024 resolution at 60 Hz frequency .	St
1.1.4	However , I have realised that at this resolution , neither graphics nor text is appearing properly .	St
1.1.5	Text is too light to read and letters appear broken .	St
1.1.6	Graphics appear stretched out .	St
1.1.7	I am using P-4 machine 1.8 GHz , 1 GB RAM , with built in Intel 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics controller and Windows 2000 Professional .	St
1.1.8	I tried re-installing drivers but that did n't help .	St
1.1.9	Any idea what could be the possible reason for this ?	Ques
1.1.10	How to get optimum viewing experience from this monitor .	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance .	St
1.1.12	Satish	St
1.2.1	If you use any ext .	St
1.2.2	cabling , remove them and have a direct connection .	St
1.2.3	Understand also , while the LCD default resolution is XYZ , your std .	St
1.2.4	output from the video port/card is is usually another XYZ too , they must match or get the best possible viewing , play with it .	St
1.2.5	Also , if you 're in an office with bright lights , etc .	St
1.2.6	and you adjust brightness/constrast to extremes viewing will diminish overall .	St
1.2.7	The bigger the screen the larger some displays show thier weakness , especially when using older video ports .	St
1.2.8	Thus , having a newer video port/card and more video ram increases enjoyment in this regard .	St
1.2.9	Last , overall the quality of the LCD counts as well , but I think you need to adjust setting for the best match as Dell offers decent LCDs .	St
1.2.10	If possible get a video display output pattern to adj .	St
1.2.11	basic setting before going overboard on anything else .	St
1.2.12	here 's a link : http : //www.brouhaha.com/~eric/software/lcdtest/ or find something similar .	St
1.2.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
