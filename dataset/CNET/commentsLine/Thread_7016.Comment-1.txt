hi all.
this is my first post so bear with me if i don't know all rules i have a web server with public ip that is connected to internal network.
i would like to display content from my networked machine.
the network machine can't be accessed from internet and i want to keep it that way.
(it can go to web though).
web server is ubuntu server so i get the part of working it out with ip tables.
i want to display content from internal nw machine but so it can only be seen through web server.
(it should be re-rendered on web server with some technology or application).
to recap: show content from nw pc on web server and only visible when looking on web server, other direct connections prevented.
thank you, mario
