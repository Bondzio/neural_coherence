1.1.1	I have recently bought a Western Digital 40Gig drive and I need to have it ghosted from a smaller drive which is 9Gig .	St
1.1.2	Would it b possible to ghost the contents of a smaller drive onto a bigger drive , will it mess up because of partitions or what .	St
1.1.3	I need to know if this will work ASAP .	St
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	That 's the best way to do it , usually a smaller HD to larger HD or of same size for less hassles .	St
1.3.2	YOu can slso ghost to partitions once to point them out and agin , the partition size should be equal or larger than the source .	St
1.3.3	Using the simplst defaults , ghosting once the HDs/partitions are ready just point out out source and destination and let it fly .	St
1.3.4	I hope this helps ... good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
