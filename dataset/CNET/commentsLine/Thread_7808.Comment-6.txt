the articles said something about that core i7's integrated memory-controller could get damaged beyond repair by memory-modules operating above 1.5v.
almost all of the ddr3 triple-channel operate at 1.65v, but then i found these.
havent had the time to try to figure out, whether there is a problem, or whether those sites(articles)are just amd-freaks bashing superior enemy architecture
