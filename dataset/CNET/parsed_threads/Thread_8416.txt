<s> I have an older emachine that I am refurbishing for a friend. </s>
<s> It is an etower 533i which came with Windows 98 installed. </s>
<s> I have upgraded the memory and it works great. </s>
<s> I installed Windows 2000 Professional (clean install) and finally got all updated drivers installed so that all hardware works perfectly with the exception of the modem. </s>
<s> No matter which driver I install, nothing happens. </s>
<s> I have installed the one that emachine provides and I have also installed what is supposed to work according to all the driver sites I've found and nothing works. </s>
<s> I understand the modem is a Conexant Soft 56K PCI Modem. </s>
<s> Can anyone help with this problem ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Conexant never made modems, just the chips. </s>
<s> As such you didn't supply the make and model of the modem for others to go find it. </s>
<s> Maybe do as I do and pull the modem out and toss it. </s>
