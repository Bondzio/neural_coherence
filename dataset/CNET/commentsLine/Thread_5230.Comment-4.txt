i am on my second canon printer, gave the first to my daughter for college.
i have always refilled my cartridges, either with a kit from costco, or one purchased over the internet.
i have never had a problem, even refilling numerous times per cartridge.
just follow the instructions carefully and have lots of tissue nearby for some minor leaking after refill.
it will soon stop and you can replace cartridge in printer and continue on with your projects.
you will have to override your printer color functions, but the printer will wlak you thru that process.
you will not be able to track ink usage after this step, but i just check them often.
