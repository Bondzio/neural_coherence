purchased a usb powered extension some time ago.
did not try it immediately as i didn't need it.
finally decided to try it and i get an error message stating &quot;usb device not recognized&quot; &quot;one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned&quot;.
i have tried the cable on two laptops and two desktops; operating systems ranging from the current windows 7; vista and windows xp.
all with the same results.
going into device manager on the xp system; it tells my that there is an &quot;unknown device&quot; and that there are no drivers installed for it.
did extensive research on the web; and every where it says that no drivers are required for a powered usb cable.
any suggestions or alternatives.
have had the cable to long to return it; so that is out!
