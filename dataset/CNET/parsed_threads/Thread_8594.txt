<s> I've enjoyed a wireless network for some time. </s>
<s> After hurricane Charlie, things got messed up and I'm in the process of networking a different computer to my host (winXP). </s>
<s> The guest computer operating system is WIN Mn. </s>
<s> I access the Internet through cable modem and use a Linksys wireless router. </s>
<s> I've played with this for days. </s>
<s> I've unplugged everything, redone it and checked all of the addresses etc., over and over. </s>
<s> I used to get 100% signal between the PCs and now the best I can get is 67%. </s>
<s> The guest computer won't even log on to the Internet. </s>
<s> I'm sure I'm overlooking some simple thing but my mind is now fried! </s>
<s> Can you suggest what I might have missed? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> I can't tell what parts you've replaced. </s>
<s> Some spend months playing with such and in the end a new wifi card or router fixes it. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, I replaced the guest (Win Mn.) </s>
<s> computer only. </s>
<s> I should tell you that a few days ago, I had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal. </s>
<s> I then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer. </s>
<s> I did that and then replaced the software etc. </s>
<s> It tells me that I'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the Internet. </s>

<s> That's a little clearer. </s>
<s> Here's what I see happen daily. </s>
<s> People format a drive and install &quot;Windows&quot;. </s>
<s> What they didn't know is that drivers for the MOTHERBOARD, USB and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the Microsoft CD. </s>
<s> It's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this. </s>
<s> Today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an OS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This is a compaq though and I used the recover disk to put it back to it's original factory condition. </s>
<s> Does you opinion still apply and if so, what do I do? </s>
<s> Valerie </s>
<s> There are more items at play here. </s>
<s> There can be updates after the CD was made. </s>
<s> I will not know what the machine needs and owners often forget. </s>
<s> When faced with these setups, we always bring spare routers and wifi client parts. </s>
