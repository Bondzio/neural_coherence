Meaning, you can change how the audio is produced like in a cave, auditorum, stage, etc.. You need you check the audio(multi-media) portion and see what if any changes can be made. You will know if that's possible, chancge it and save upon exiting that area. This should be found under the control panel area. Mine is for the AC'97. It could be another problem area, but that's where I check first. You can also verify under the device setting what the outputs are set at, like XYZ??? device. tada -----Willy

If you run XP, then you have an icon under control panel that's labeled, &quot;Sound Effect Manager&quot;. If none, you have what? tada -----Willy
