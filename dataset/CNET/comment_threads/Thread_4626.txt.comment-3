Replaced the battery today, no improvement.
- can't get into the bios as I have no visual.
The psu has only been installed recently and has been running for about 24hrs, would it start to fail after such a short period?
I have 2Gb of ram and windows 7 running - although operating system doesn't strike me as the issue seeing as majority of the problems happen before the OS loads.
Last time the computer was momentarily working I got a computer literate mate of mine to install all new bios and drivers and that wasn't long ago.
Thanks, keep the suggestions coming.
