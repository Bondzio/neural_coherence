Hey people First of all apologies if this is in the wrong section, I was a little confused to where to create a ew topic and thought this would be the best place but mods please remove if you feel necessary. I was hoping someone could offer me a little support regarding trying to add my new tv/monitor as my secondary monitor to my pc, ideally what I want is when you add a second monitor to your laptop as an extended monitor that is what I require. Is this possible? If so how? Would I need to purchase an additional graphioc card for my pc? Could you recommend me one? Or could I purchase something like a vga splitter which I would plug in the back of my vga slot and it would have two female vga connections? Thank you.

So all I need to do is add this pci card to my motherboard and then buy a hdmi cable? and connect the cable from the pc to the tv? the only query I have regarding this is that would my pc sound also come out of my tv? That is ideal for me. I know I could have gone down the easy route of getting a vga connection for my pc but the hdmi graphics will be better and I might get sound.

Also, any USB Video is far too slow to play video such as DVD or games. But about HDMI. A few of the newer laptops in the office have HDMI and those can ship sound over HDMI. But again I can't see a make and model so the discussion runs flat. Bob

If not I would have thought it would be better to have 2 as I don't think you can split 1 output. Bear in mind though that when you have dual-screens (extended desktop) it can have a performance impact on games i.e. tearing on screen etc. So you're better off turning the extended desktop off if you play games.

It's call &quot;vga video splitter&quot; with 4 ports up to 1920x1440 resolution and it's made by IOGear. $45 with $10 instant saving. I did see another devices for such purpose but I forgot the name or where I have seen it. So it's out there. This one could be use as clone or display extension.
