Bob, Thanks for responding.
My computer doesn't have the front USB ports - only the back ones of which I have only two.
They have worked for using a mouse for example.
I am not the most computer savvy person, so please excuse that fact.
If you could recommend a couple of drivers as per your comment, then I can try each one until hopefully it works.
Thank you very much.
