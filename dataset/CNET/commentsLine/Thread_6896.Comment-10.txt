but that is exactly how pcs are fixed today.
someone gets to go in and troubleshoot the pc.
the home builder is sometimes at a disadvantage since they don't do this a lot and may not have spares to test with.
here i might debate if it's cheaper since one trip to a repair counter is 120 bucks plus parts.
not one service desk i know will troubleshoot and say it's the video card.
why?
because if you replaced that and it still didn't work, would you be upset?
this is why the usual repair centers don't take in such a request.
