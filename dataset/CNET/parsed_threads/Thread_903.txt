<s> your power supply is failing. </s>
<s> I is probably sensing a voltage problem and shuts down before any more damage is done. </s>
<s> They are cheap so replace and see what happens. </s>
<s> A few more specs on your machine might help also . </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> as for overheating it doesnt have time to overheat so i doubt that. </s>
<s> the power supply was changed last night and the same problem is still going on. </s>
<s> i will give more specs later....dont actually have the computer with me. </s>
<s> its my moms and she is ohio while im here in louisiana trying to help her figure it out. </s>
<s> here are some of the specs on this computer mother board can handle a 133, 266, 333 Fsb AMD AthlonXP Processor. </s>
<s> The Video was a Geforce4 MX 440. </s>
<s> Had about 512MB od DDR2 Ram. </s>
<s> Around a 60 gig Fast 7200Rpm HardDrive. </s>
<s> 56kModem, and 5.1 Sound out of the motherboard </s>
<s> First; with the power off, open the case and remove the family of &quot;Dust Bunnies&quot; which may have taken residence there. </s>
<s> Vacuum first and then blow with the other end of the vacuum or use compressed air. </s>
<s> Pay particular attention to the fan & heat sink on the CPU; the vents in the power supply; and the cooling fans. </s>
<s> Look for anything which might have come loose, (like the heat sink which should be on the CPU). </s>
<s> Second; with the case open, turn on the power and observe the system. </s>
<s> Look and listen for anything which seems amiss. </s>
<s> If the problem still occurs and all the fans are operating properly, replacing the power supply is the next step. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
