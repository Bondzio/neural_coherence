i want to link two towers together as one system.
i do not wish to use two monitors or two keyboards or two oss.
my newer primary pc would be the link to the net.
one printer would be used for both.
how can this be done?
how can i marry them together without creating a network of machines?
what would i need?
i have an old pc that i would like to use for its resources .... cpu, drives etc., to enhance my current system.
can i marry them together without creating a network?
what about the oss, can i use one os to run both towers?
is this possible?
