<s> I was hoping to get some reviews/suggestions on external hard drive enclosures. </s>
<s> I have a ton of hard drives just sitting around and I would like to use them to back up my computer. </s>
<s> I haven't been able to find solid reviews on them however. </s>
<s> I have been looking intently at these two: 1. </s>
<s> AMS VENUS DS-2316B2BK 3.5&quot; USB 2.0 Black External Enclosure 2. </s>
<s> VANTEC Nexstar 3 NST-360U2-RD 3.5&quot; USB 2.0 External Enclosure Does anybody have any experience with these? </s>
<s> Do I really need a fan? </s>
<s> Will an alluminum case be enough? </s>
<s> Are there better ones out there? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I'd say go for the AMS Venus. </s>
<s> I got a 200 gig running in a Venus caseing and it is sweet. </s>
<s> Get a little warm if i forget to shut it off but it's nothing out of the norm. </s>
<s> Another thing is it's real quiet too and if we're talking about the same models since i'm too lazy to do a google and check the fan is a nice feature. </s>
<s> A few down sides to the venus is it's not exactly what you would concider 'shock proof'. </s>
<s> this is due to the design of the drive. </s>
<s> the HDD screws on top of the fan which screws into the caseing from the back. </s>
<s> If this is for a sit and light travel but mostly for sitting and collecting dust highly recommended. </s>
<s> Vantec...i stay far far away from these. </s>
<s> Not from personal experience but a good friend of mine who gets a new HDD and enclosure every 6 months has nothing but burning hatred toward Vantecs. </s>
<s> According to him the two Vantec enclosures he bought failed and took the hard drives along with it. </s>
<s> Meaning nothing was salvageable cept screws. </s>
<s> Well that's my two cents </s>
<s> That's really interesting. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I've kind of been leaning towards the AMS anyway due to the fan. </s>
<s> I'm not 100% sure I need it, but I guess it gives me one more piece of security. </s>
<s> Don't know if u want to shop around but the Mad dog 3.5 enclosure w/ the usb and firewire connection has been good to me for about 6 mo. </s>
<s> now, with no signs of wear. </s>
<s> No real heat buildup to speak of, provided your just using it to back up files ect..No fan in it either though, but for the price, $42.00 where I got it,it has been a trooper. </s>
<s> Nice and quiet also,and pretty shock resistent (I've move or kicked it at least 4-5 times).Hope this helps. </s>
<s> they're all aluminium and they handle HDDs up to 1TB. </s>
<s> They're about $40.00 at BUY.COM ...best delivered price source I've found. </s>
<s> Thanks for the information, but what few reviews I have found on the adaptec said that they tend to run hot. </s>
<s> Also, I guess Buy.com raised their price to $45 for what it's worth. </s>
<s> put a Raptor in there but I have three of the Adaptec enclosures ....2 of the ACS-100s and ACS-200 ((?) </s>
<s> the one for the 2.5&quot; HDDs) and never had any problems with any of them. </s>
<s> I use them primarily for extra image backups and data transfer between home and work PCs. </s>
<s> Key is they work reliably and with all my systems and handle HDDs up to 1TB. </s>
<s> Many of the others don't work with HDDs over 300 or 400GBs. </s>
<s> At the time I got the notebook HDD...I had trouble finding any 2.5&quot; enclosure that handle 2.5 HDDs over 80GBs. </s>
<s> Here's another enclosure that looks interesting...I have an external USB by BYTECC also ... but this case looks interesting. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817145378 . </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll check them out some more. </s>
<s> I'm just struggling with it, because I hear all this stuff about problems and unreliability. </s>
<s> It just makes me nervous. </s>
<s> Maybe that's a good thing. </s>
<s> In all my life I have never crashed a computer or lost a drive...knock on wood. </s>
<s> I should quit reading these forums. </s>
<s> They are making me paranoid. </s>
<s> All this talk of drives failing has got me questioning myself. </s>
<s> Here was my original plan: 1. </s>
<s> Used external enclosure to back up my system. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Pull out hard drive, box it, and put it in my safe deposit box. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Install second HDD and backup again. </s>
<s> Now even as I write this I'm pretty sure its a stupid question, but if there is a failure of the external drive, there shouldn't be any problems pulling the one out of the SDB and reinstalling. </s>
<s> Should there? </s>
<s> I do have DVD backups, but that sounds like a nightmare to reinstall the kind of info I have from DVD's. </s>
<s> Honestly, if had to backup all at once to DVD's it would probably take me a couple of days. </s>
<s> But there's lots of good discussion about backup strategies... </s>
<s> I always use two internal HDDs ... (three including an external HDD which holds a second copy of my backup) and it's worked for me and those I help since 2001. </s>
<s> I sleep well. </s>
<s> First hard drive has two partitions .... - Partition 1 The OS and the Apps - Partition 2 All data, downloads, updates, etc., Second hard drive also has two partitions.... - Partition 1 small partition for a swap file - Partition 2 large partition for image files of both C: and D: In the event C: becomes corrupt and cannot be quickly fixed thru restore points or other...I get out my Ghost 2003 floppy disk and restore C: (the first physical hard drive) from one of the images stored on the 2nd physical hard drive. </s>
<s> If the first drive dies mechanically ...I get a new drive, install it and restore the images again from the second hard drive. </s>
<s> If the original HDD is still under warranty ...I send it back and put the warranty replacement on the shelf when it's replaced. </s>
<s> Actually have several spare HDDs so the restore is very quick and as easy and painless as a drive failures can be. </s>
<s> To take it one step further...I copy images of drive C: and drive D: to an external HDD that I can keep safe in my desk at work. </s>
<s> I also protect the system with a good UPS that minimizes data loss and potential corruption from unanticipated power outages. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
