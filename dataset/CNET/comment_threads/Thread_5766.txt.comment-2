Hi lggiemo, Before replacing the video card, I would try all software troubleshooting options.
For instance, try updating your video driver.
Here is the latest from HP for your PC: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=pv-62691-1&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&os=2093&product=3644699 Also, what monitor do you have?
You may need to install a new monitor driver or other monitor software.
