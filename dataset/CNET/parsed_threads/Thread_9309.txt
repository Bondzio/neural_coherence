<s> Since a few days, Home and End keys don't work. </s>
<s> If, for example, I'd want to go to the beginning of this post, I'd have to use cursor keys or the mouse, too bad. </s>
<s> I can't figure out why is this happening. </s>
<s> I have WinXP with Service Pack 2. </s>
<s> Any idea? </s>
<s> Happened after SP2? </s>
<s> (clue) Or a &quot;keylogger&quot; virus? </s>
<s> If you bring up Word or Wordpad and type in a few words and hit home or end do you have the same problem. </s>
<s> Do you have the same problem with both sets of home/end keys. </s>
<s> Can you try a different keyboard? </s>
<s> Yes, the problem is the same in ANY program I try. </s>
<s> Both sets of home/end keys? </s>
<s> Do you mean RePag/AvPag? </s>
<s> If so, they work OK. </s>
<s> I could BUY a different keyboard, but I don't think that's the problem. </s>
<s> All other keys work perfectly, and these two ones have ceased to work at the same time. </s>
<s> Curious... </s>
<s> I can't remember exactly if it happened a little after or a little before installing sp2. </s>
<s> I'm sure it didn't happen JUST after sp2. </s>
<s> I'll pass Spybot to see if it's a keylogger. </s>
<s> No keylogger found, I was wondering, could it be the generic driver that Windows uses for this keyboard is not correct? </s>
<s> The keyboard has 105 keys. </s>
<s> Every standard keyboard has 2 home and 2 end keys. </s>
<s> One set on the number pad and the other between it and the keyboard off. </s>
<s> Do both sets fail to work? </s>
<s> Go to housecall.antivirus.com and run a virus check to see if you have a worm. </s>
<s> Can you believe I never noticed that!!! </s>
<s> I always used the set between the numpad and the rest of the keyboard. </s>
<s> Those are the ones that don't work. </s>
<s> The ones in the numpad (7 and 1) work OK. </s>
<s> I'll run that virus check right now (anyway I have Kaspersky running as resident). </s>
<s> is set up automatically on at boot. </s>
<s> This can be changed in &quot;setup&quot; (BIOS). </s>
<s> May be the reason num pad works and other keys don't. </s>
<s> Per session, without bios change, you can toggle the num lock on-off. </s>
