blessings, i tried what you suggested-reformatting the sata drive.
after wiping, i went to restart and now it is asking for a password!!
i didn't password protect this drive, so i don't know what is going on.
1. how can i get past the request for password screen?
2. do i need another reformat?
3. is there something else i can do to solve this problem?
thanks, deborah
