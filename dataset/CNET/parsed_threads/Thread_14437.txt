<s> I bought a wireless card a few weeks ago (Linksys Wireless G PCI card WMP54GS) and it worked perfectly right out of the box. </s>
<s> I have two networks that I connect to. </s>
<s> One is wired and the other wireless. </s>
<s> I would just disable the one I wasn't using and enable the other. </s>
<s> For some reason though this morning when I tried to enable the wireless network connection the computer froze (Windows XP Pro SP2). </s>
<s> I restarted and the same thing happened. </s>
<s> I tried reseating the card and installing the latest drivers. </s>
<s> Windows detects the new hardware but then I get an error that says the device was unable to start (Code 10). </s>
<s> The Linksys tech support reps weren't very helpful. </s>
<s> The only suggestion they had was that there was an IRQ conflict and they couldn't help me with it. </s>
<s> Everything else on the computer is working fine. </s>
<s> I haven't made any hardware or major software changes. </s>
<s> What can I do about this? </s>
<s> Another small thing I noticed was that when I reinstalled the drivers it labels the card as &quot;#2.&quot; This leads me to believe that it still thinks there is another card installed from my first installation. </s>
<s> How do I get rid of this? </s>
<s> Thanks, Kevin </s>
<s> IRQ conflicts are technically impossible in PCI systems. </s>
<s> Your post didn't get much indication of the host machine so any input I can give is going to be generic. </s>
<s> -&gt; Use system restore to when it worked. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I would start by removing the Linksys card from the device manager in Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Computer Management&gt;Device Manager&gt;Network Adapters. </s>
<s> Remove both instances of the card in this area. </s>
<s> Reboot your computer next and let the operating system detect and set up the card. </s>
<s> My bet is that this will resolve your conflict. </s>
<s> right click my computer -&gt; properties -&gt; click devices -&gt; click device manager. </s>
<s> open the network cards icon (green) you'll see a red x on both your wireless cards click on each one and delete them one at a time, except your lan card, just delete the wireless cards. </s>
<s> now restart the computer and windows should detect and auto install the drivers, if it can't find the drivers then click the cancel button and reinstall the linksys driver setup. </s>
<s> once installed if you need to reboot then reboot. </s>
<s> now click start -&gt; settings -. </s>
<s> control panel -. </s>
<s> network connections. </s>
<s> right click the wireless card -. </s>
<s> click properties -. </s>
<s> click the advanced tab -. </s>
<s> click the checkbox next to windows firewall to uncheck the box. </s>
<s> this will disable the windows firewall and should allow your wireless to communicate. </s>
