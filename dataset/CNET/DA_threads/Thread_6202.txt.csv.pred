1.2.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/02/16/is_the_acer_f20_the_ferrari_of_lcd_monitors/page7.html - &quot;Gaming is possible with this monitor.	St
1.2.2	But its performance was well short of that of the best 4:3 monitors&quot; - &quot;We found that latency was much less perceptible with video applications, but the movies we screened were fairly noisy&quot; - &quot;Given what you get for the high price, the F20 will probably remain more a showpiece for Acer than anything else&quot; the dell ultrasharp gets better reviews but lacks the f20's standard def tv tuner.	St
1.2.3	http://reviews.cnet.com/Dell_UltraSharp_2007WFP/4505-3174_7-31783769.html - &quot;Tested at its native resolution of 1,680x1,050, the Dell UltraSharp 2007WFP delivered excellent performance on CNET Labs' DisplayMate-based tests.&quot; - &quot;Despite a relatively slow 16-millisecond pixel-response rate, DVD performance was also sharp, smooth, and detailed.&quot; - &quot;We noticed only minimal ghosting.	St
1.2.4	Gaming performance was nearly perfect, with accurate colors and overall sharpness.&quot;	St
