My scanner was connected with my old system with win 98 SE and the scanner was working fine.Replaced the system with new one but the scanner does not detect on either OS.Checking device manager does not show any imaging device. Since the scanner is old, I have driver for the same on floppies but do not know how to install the scanner and then install the driver for the same. Appreciate some help. Thanks. Mahendra

I can assure you will spend a months trying to get that scanner working on a new machine and OS if your download from hp.com didn't work on day one. I will not be offering any help to make it work. After years of running into this, you learn to not walk into the tarpits. Bob

Beside Win XP also didn't support it (correct me if i'm wrong) That scanner + ISA scsi only works on 95 and 98. The problem is SCSI card compatibility... Unless you can make the old ISA SCSI works in windows XP, donate it to someone who need and get a new scanner. FYI, I have 4 good and working scanner (IIc, IIcx, 4c, 4p) that collecting dust in my garage... just because I move to windows XP.
