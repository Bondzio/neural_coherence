you don't want to know i tossed out an epson c80 last week.
i think someone carted it off and they won't write a similar post.
nothing tells me that your printer actually works.
on the downside i had to buy a full set of new ink to see if the printer had failed.
of course it had failed.
so smarting from that failure i bought a new printer and am back in business.
to remove part of the stinging feeling i lucked out and found another c80 owner and shipped him the full set of inks, then tossed out the old printer.
you have to grapple with these printers since the costs are now so low that a full set of inks is close to what the new printer is... bob
