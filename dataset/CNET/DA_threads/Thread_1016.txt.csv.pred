1.1.1	I am trying to switch a SATA hard drive with windows xp on it, to a dell machine.	St
1.1.2	I hooked it up, but got a STOP 0x0000000b error (don't know if that's the exact number or not).	St
1.1.3	Now i read up and I think it means I need to install my dell hard drive drivers on the hard drive to use it and boot it, but how do I go about doing that?	St
1.1.4	If that's not right, and you know what is, it'd be great if your could help out.	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Windows can't move from machine to machine.	St
1.2.2	You get to install it as you change motherboards and such.	St
1.2.3	And no.	St
1.2.4	You can't just install the Dell drivers.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
