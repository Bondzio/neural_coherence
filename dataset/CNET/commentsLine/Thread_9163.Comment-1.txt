hi i just bought a new mic, the trouble is it doesnt detect sound, my laptop is new and this is a non usb mic.
i have unmuted everything on both playback and recording.
windows help told me to go to the speech regonition tab, but there isnt one, i click on speech and there isnt one there.
any ideas?
