<s> Hello, I have no idea if this is in the right forum or not, so please don't complain about it. </s>
<s> Anyway, when ever I put in a black DVD-R+ into my DVD drive/burner, it switches to a CD drive. </s>
<s> I have tried enabling recording and switching the registry drive numbers from 1 to 2 as said on MS's website. </s>
<s> I also tried uninstalling it and restarting letting Windows configure it itself. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I am running windows XP Media 2005, latest updates from Windows Update service. </s>
<s> That's not a sign of any issue. </s>
<s> XP does not know about DVD recording so there's nothing to fix here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So you're saying that XP doesn't have support to burn DVDs? </s>
<s> Well, could you recommend an app that does it for free and efficiently? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> If you're in a hurry ... you can easily find what you're looking for (or attractively-priced commercial SW) through your favorite search engine. </s>
<s> I use/recommend Roxio Easy CD Creator and you can get good deals on it if you're willing to look ... but free it's not. </s>
<s> Good Luck VAPCMD </s>
<s> Imgburn. </s>
<s> If you want to author DVD's for free, that is also available. </s>
<s> Check out the tools (on the left side) here : http://forum.videohelp.com/ There are guides to tell you how. </s>
<s> Give a look. </s>
