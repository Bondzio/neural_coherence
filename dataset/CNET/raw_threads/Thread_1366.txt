I already own the 4 matching monitors, all are acer x243w - 24inch widescreens, I currently have 2 hooked up thru my computer off the video card, but would love to have all four *if not for maybe 3?) hooked up for a reallly extended desktop. What I am looking for is advice on what will work to make this happen or if this is even possible given my current equipment and setup. I own an HP M7760n Multimedia computer 2.13 GHz Core 2, 2 Gig Ram, Vista Home Premium, the only upgraded item is the video card, I put in an msi 8600 Geforce GT card in it so I could run dual dvi monitors. I checked out the HP page and it says I have one pci express 16, and 3 pci slots, I am using that geforce gt card in the pci express 16 slot, so available i have 2 pci's and the onboard video. Is it possible at all to use the onboard video to add at least a 3rd monitor? I hooked one up and rebooted but it didn't seem to recognize there was a 3rd monitor... Is there anything in the bios I need to adjust to allow onboard video to work with a pci express card or is this just not going to work? I saw an option of a pci card by ati that supported upto 4 monitors, would that work in my pci slot? (there is also a pci express 1 version) but I dont have a pci express 1 slot. Just trying to learn what I could do (if anything) to add a 3rd or 4th monitor to this system and make it all &quot;work&quot;. Thanks for any help on this. Bill

The easiest thing would be to change the motherboard, it would allow you to add an additional PCI-E card and would help to future proof your PC a little. 2 video cards in SLI (in your case 8600GTx2) would allow you to have 4 displays. Keep in mind you would need a SLI ready Powersupply with the correct voltage and amps along with a SLI ready motherboard.

Your options are limited because you already have pushed the normal video limits. No matter what direction you take, its going to cost. Either replace the system to better handle this due to more slots or get a ext. video box that splits amongest the LCDs. Matrox makes such and I'm sure others at least duo display maybe more. You need to google for vendors and/or solutions currently out there. If you find a video card with more than 2 ports, then its a very special card, and probably is the most installable for your HP. Under HP bios once you install another video port/card, on-board becomes disabled but again that depends on the video maker, in what they may offer via the s/w side. Verify what the bios will do or check the manual/support website. tada -----Willy

Worth a try tho i guess... Bill

Then you can just add an extra monitor through a USB port, and you don't even have to open the computer. You can even use multiple adapters to add extra monitors.
