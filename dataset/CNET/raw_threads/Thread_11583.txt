Cause the name and mark was earase, so I could not know what is it to find. It has three pins look like transitor, but using only two pins. So any body know well about that Eprom can show me where can find it? Thank so much for instruction. Le LT

Since, you didn't mention even the product, well alot is not known. I can only assume the eprom is special or rated for certain usage and pins are cut or made w/o them in order to fulfill its mission. BUT, it maybe a generic(you find one, then clip pins) eprom done in this matter only because the OEM wants it that way. -----Willy

I read this, and I suspect you are talking about the clear Eprom header that a lot of motherboards have. It is a three pin connector with a jumper that you pull from the one side and put across the other side to clear the EEPROM(To reset the bios EEPROM back to the factory defaults) I may be off base about this, but from your post I am guessing that you are not talking about a special EEPROM like the one wire EEPROM... If I am wrong, then never mind... If you are trying to clear your BIOS Eprom, then you need to look in the motherboard manual, or just look at the motherboard and find the 3 pin header with Erase marked next to the pin that is not jumpered.
