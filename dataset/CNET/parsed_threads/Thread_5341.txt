<s> I bought myself a 1 GB stick of RAM for an old Tower I had been using, but it has since died (I'm hoping the RAM stick didn't have anything to do with it...). </s>
<s> I believe the RAM is DDR 1. </s>
<s> So I'm wondering, if I go and buy myself a new 3 GB equipped computer that uses DDR3 and I put the old stick in one of it's spare slots... will that helpmate computer in any way? </s>
<s> Or would it just hinder it? </s>
<s> I think the technical term for what I'm asking is backwards compatibility. </s>
<s> *will that help the computer* </s>
<s> you cannot put a DDR1 ram in a DDR3 socket. </s>
<s> It won't fit. </s>
<s> lol, thanks for the swift response to my query. </s>
