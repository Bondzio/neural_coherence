i'm running xp sp2 on a hp pavilion.
i have recently upgraded the ram from 256mhz to 1ghz.
since i have done this i occasionaly (but regular enough to be now getting on my nerves) find xp shutting down, restarting and filing an error report as &quot;the system has recovered from a serious error&quot;.
microsoft reports that it is a device driver that has caused the problem but can be no more specific about which one.
as the only hardware i have changed recently is the ram, i can only assume this is the cause.
to complicate things a little the replacement ram is 2nd hand but is in good working order (pc2100 266ddr).
it is by the same manufacturer as the original, but i don't know who that is!!
the logo is a rounded letter m circled by a planet-style ring.
1) does ram require a driver?
2) who is the manufacturer of my ram?
3) am i barking up the wrong tree?
i haven't lost any work yet, but it can't be long.
any advice would be much appreciated.
