<s> I have a HP Pavilion 8505, year 1999 model. </s>
<s> It's having a Pentium III 450 Mhz clock and 100 Mhz FSB cpu. </s>
<s> It's a Katmai Slot 1 SECC2 processor. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade the cpu to 800 Mhz. </s>
<s> But i think katmai CPUs have max 600 Mhz clock rate. </s>
<s> Will 800 Mhz Coppermine be compatible with my ASUS P2B-VT Motherboard having Intel 440BX Chipset ? </s>
<s> If no, then would upgrading the RAM from 192 mb to 384 mb (max possible) improve the system performance instead of the above mentioned cpu upgrade ? </s>

<s> I don't think the computer is worth upgrading. </s>
<s> Save the money for the next computer (be it used or new). </s>
<s> You probably will get more bangs for the bucks (just my thought). </s>
<s> How much do you think you want to spend? </s>
<s> Basically i'm upgrading this pc for improving the internet surfing(cos' browser is working slow), a lot of downloading and also some applications sometimes takes 30 sec - 1 minute to start up. </s>
<s> Does a change from 450 Mhz to 800 Mhz Cpu clock would improve the above or the RAM upgrade from 192 MB to 384 MB or Both? </s>
<s> But if you've got 50 bucks to spend go here. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/ Bump the ram to the max. </s>
<s> Might give you a little bump in system perf. </s>
<s> Be malware free. </s>
<s> You've got a low horsepower machine. </s>
<s> Keep that startup list super skinny. </s>
