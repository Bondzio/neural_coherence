if you want the two cards to work together or entirely separately.
If you're wanting something like crossfire, I believe you need cards with matching chipsets, RAM amounts, etc.
Someone here is probably going to say that you might want to move up to larger PS as well.
In any event, tell what sort of a hand you're looking for and you'll probably get a better response than mine.
