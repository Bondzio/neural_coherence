It's a little embarrassing, but it turned out to be a fan after all.
Willy's recommendation of looking for a front fan turned out to be the issue.
I had actually looked there in the past and saw nothing, but there in fact was a fan up there that I'd missed (thanks Willy, and sorry I responded too quickly with there is no front fan).
It seems hard to miss a fan, but it's hidden very well.
Anyway, I would not have found it if not for posting and getting great ideas.
Thanks all.
