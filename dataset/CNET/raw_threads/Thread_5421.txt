1059	0	235354	2412819	NR	samssf	2/24/07 9:33 AM	1.17230958E12	pc randomly turns off with 512MB RAM, but fine with 256MB	I have a Compaq Presario V2135US that is acting bizarre... When I boot to Windows XP or even the XP disc, my laptop will shortly thereafter shut off (within 30s or so) I boot using Ultimate Boot CD and ram MEMTEST and several other memory and hard disk diagnostic tools, but found no problems. I have 2 sticks of 133mhz 256MB RAM. If I remove EITHER of them and reboot, the system will work flawlessly and will not shut off. I have tried both sticks of RAM separately in each slot, and either way the laptop will work as long as I only use one stick of RAM... so I'm pretty sure it's not related to the slots or the RAM itself. Another thing I find interesting is with this problem... the laptop will actually turn off, rather than reboot... which is what happens sometimes when windows experiences a critical error. If I try to boot to a Windows XP install disc I experience the same problem... around the time that the dialog box shows up asking me if I want to Repair or Install. Thanks, any help is appreciated.

Some laptops have a small int. fan for the cpu which in turn it mounted to a heat plate, the fan helps cool the laptop. if the fan fails, the heat plate still cools the cpu but it isn't as efficient, so you get into critial heat range and begin a shutdown. The fan itself is quite, but a non-working is real quite and you won't know until too late. If your has one, verify its operation. You can use a &quot;laptop cooler&quot;, available at most office centers or shops and see if that helps. tada -----Willy
