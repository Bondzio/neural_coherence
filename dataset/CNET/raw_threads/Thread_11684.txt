To remove the floppy, the floppy must be disabled in the BIOS. Just removing it from device manager will cause it to be reinstalled on reboot. Go into the BIOS and navigate to the floppy controller and disable it. Power off and unplug the ribbon and power cable from the drive, and remove the drive. How many optical drives do you have now? If you have only one, the IDE cable may have two connectors and just plugging another drive into the other connector will do what you want. If you have two optical drives you'll need to add a PCI controller card. Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't.
