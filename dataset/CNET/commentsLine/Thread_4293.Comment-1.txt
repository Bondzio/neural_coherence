this past monday, my house suffered severe smoke damage from a fire, with the third floor getting most of the damage.
my sony vaio, which is my main computer and was bought 3 months ago, was on the first floor and i need to access it for information.
in addition, i had to two other usable computers on the third floor.
what do i need to do in order to clean all 3 pcs up so that they can be accessed and/or used again?
i know soot is a conductor for electricity and i don't want to short any of them out.
in addition, i do not have the money to take them anywhere to get any diagnostics done, either.
please help!
