<s> hi all, i have been trying to get wallwatcher to work. </s>
<s> i have one of the supported routers, airlink101 ar525w, and i have logging enabled and i put in the static ip of my computer. </s>
<s> i then fire up wallwatcher and pick my router from its list and make sure my routers ip is correct. </s>
<s> anyway it just keeps saying &quot;starting&quot; but never actually connects or displays any info. </s>
<s> does anyone have any other software solutions or recommendations for me? </s>
<s> snmp 161/tcp SNMP snmp 161/udp SNMP snmptrap 162/tcp SNMPTRAP snmptrap 162/udp SNMPTRAP Your firewalls must not block these ports. </s>
<s> are you referring to computer firewalls or the routers?i tried the ping router function built into wallwatcher and it said it could ping my router fine... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> well i opened those ports and no luck... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
