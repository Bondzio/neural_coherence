Routine run of Spybot S&D today zapped my connectivity, and after three system restore operations, the problem is still there. It tells me that this problem is occurring because ''the network did not assign a network address to the computer.'' Indeed, running ipconfig shows the IP address and Subnet Mask as zeros. All other machines not affected, but I am floundering attempting to rectify this problem. I am running WinXP Home on the affected pc, and WinXP Pro on the other two. I would very much appreciate some advice on this one.

I thought about it a bit, and noted the addresses by using ipconfig on the other computers in the network, then manually entered the logical missing address on the affected machine. Where there's a will there's a way, it seems!

I don't quite know how NewDotNet got on my machine but I do know that it took a lot work to get if off and then I lost my internet. I tried everything, I was on the verge of reinstalling my Windows partition but I decided to wait till I could use someone else's internet. This was the perfect post, I typed &quot;network did not assign a network address XP&quot; into Googel and this was the first on the list. It even stated what I had done to get this problem. I alway come here first for downloads but now I've even more to thankfull for! Thank you Matt and thank you CNET!!!

My Windows MCE reported that it could not access the program guide , so it threw away my channel settings and guide data. I restored my machine , messed about with DNS settings . It got so that no browser would work , although i could ping anything . This took maybe 12 hours work. I used the winsockfix , and MCE started working again . Absolutely brilliant. I note this in case some other poor soul is fighting MCE in a similar way & it could save them a load of time.

I spent hours on netgear tech support line with some helpful reps, but after hitting the end of the road they suggested I contact HP about the network adapter. I decided it would be easier to buy a new one which didn't work either. This fix gave me an immediate connection. Thanks!

What exactly did you do on the client (like formatting and installing)? Where does the message come up (client or server)? When does the message appear? And what is the full text of the message? What's the structure of your network (including routers, hubs, Internet connection and that kind of stuff)? Kees

If you can connect to the internet using your modem, try this.(If you are hacking someone else's network, this won't work) 1. Open your web browser and make sure it's working.(then minimize it) 2. Connect to the network, even if it gives you that message. 3. Get the network's default gateway on your wireless connection status.(It is under the support tab)If it doesn't say it, it is probably 192.168.1.1 4. Type that into your browser's address bar to change your settings.

My network consists of an Airport Extreme wifi, 1 iMac (Admin), 1 Old Mac, and my pc. Both macs are able to connect the internet without problem. In my pc I am using the Asus Wifi-Ap Solo, that came with the motherboard to connect to the network. Story: Last night I wanted to watch 'The Prisoner' on amctv.com, however, I live in the uk so could not watch it. I downloaded AnchorFree's Hotspot Shield to hide my real IP so that I could watch it. [When I installed it, my pc appeared to re-discover my wireless connection, although maybe that was supposed to happen]. When I quit Hotspot Shield, my computer said I was still fully connected to the network and internet, however no pages were loading, or email, msn etc. This morning I reset my network and modem to try and fix this issue. The 2 Macs connected back fine instantly, but my pc showed the &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error. I have done countless reboots, ran Winsock XP Fix, ran ResetTCPIP.msi, set up my network again, and I must say I am stumped I called my ISP and they said they cant do anything if its just 1 computer on the network that isnt working, fair enough. TCP/IP properties set to automatic. DHCP is enabled. Auto-configuration is enabled. When I repair the connection and it fails, I go to status and get this: IP: 169.254.71.9 Subnet Mask: 255.255.0 Default Gateway: 169.254.71.9 DNS: [Blank] WINS: [Blank] From the help section on my ISP's website I found that the 169 in my IP address means that my pc failed to contact the DHCP server. It has worked fine up until now. This has been driving me nuts all day, any help will be greatly appreciated.

Although when I enable the password I am get the good-old &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error. This is with the correct password entered as well, as when a wrong password in entered it doesn't connect to the network at all like normal. Anyone got any idea why I can only connect when I have no password? Im not too happy about using an insecure network....

After a long frustrating week getting notices that say: &quot;You might not be able to access the internet . . . . . . because the network did not assign a network address to the computer.&quot; my oldest laptop running Windows XP is back in business and connecting to the internet. The trouble began when I ran a bit of proprietary software (SYSTEM MECHANIC) intended to speed up operations of my XP operating system.
