I upgraded my firmware on my router, (Netgear WGR614v6), to version wgr614v6_2_0_19_1_0_19_na.chk and everything works great except I cannot send email. I used MS Outlook with pop3 mail settings: incoming port 110, outgoing port: 25. All the default stuff. I'm able to send email from other places, which leads me to believe it might be he firmware upgrade. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.
