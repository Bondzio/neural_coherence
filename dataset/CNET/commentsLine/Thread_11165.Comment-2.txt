you neglected the forum tip: &quot;if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; if you had written more about the machine, i may have asked (and still will) if the windows 2000 service pack 4 and all critical updates were installed plus drivers for the motherboard.
tell more, get more.
