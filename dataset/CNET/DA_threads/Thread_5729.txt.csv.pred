1.1.1	Hi!	St
1.1.2	I've posted before and the printing problem still not solved.	St
1.1.3	The printer is HP LaserJet 1000.	St
1.1.4	It's a network printer, meaning when the computer that is experiencing the problem wants to print with this LaserJet 1000, it will go to the network, look for the printer and print.	St
1.1.5	The Operating System of the computer is Windows XP and Service Pack 1.	St
1.1.6	A very old computer (i think it just met the minimum requirements for installing Windows XP).	St
1.1.7	Information on the printer: Driver Name: IMFNT5.DLL Data file: SDhp1000.SDD Config file: SDNT5UI.DLL Driver version 5.51 Environment: Windows NT x86 The problem is like this.	St
1.1.8	Sometimes, when we print a document or any file, the application just hang there, not responding.	St
1.1.9	Then we tried printing the test page, the computer has problem finding the printer and hang there.	St
1.1.10	And after we restart, we can print again.	St
1.1.11	How?	St
1.1.12	Any idea?	St
1.1.13	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	a year ago i had the exact same problem just not networking restrat print print hang i just reinstalled the driver for the printer and solved all the problems no trouble yet	St
