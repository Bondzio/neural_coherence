some time back i had an major hard drive crash and at that time i contacted stellar (  ) .. as my hard drive was making sound, they suggested me take the hard drive to their data recovery clean room.
and my good luck!
they were successful in recovering my data.. then i went through the successful data recovery stories & testimonials of stellar i came to knew that these people have recovered the data from burnt hard drive also... they are really god for lost data...
