1.1.1	I am planning to buy this netgear router NETGEAR N600 Wireless Dual Band Router WNDR3400 the description of this route says i can get a combined thruput of 300 + 300 because it is a dual band Now my laptop has got an intel centrino Advanced-N 6200 wi-fi adapter .	St
1.1.2	http : //www.intel.com/products/wirele ... 6200/index.htm the description of adapter says it works in dual band and will give me 300 max throughput .	St
1.1.3	Question : Can I configure this adapter in laptop to work in dual band and get 300+300 max throughput ?	Ques
1.2.1	I have yet to find anyone achieve this since all the adapters or on 2.4 or the other band .	St
1.2.2	Not both at the same time .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	In my laptop , I can see there is an option to set my intel wireless adapter to either 2.4 or 5 or multi-band If I were to change to multi band and use this router , shudnt i get 300 + 300 ?	Ques
1.4.1	But why not try and convince yourself ?	Sug
1.4.2	Kees	St
1.5.1	I 've seen such seek one or the other but I fear you think it will do both at the same time .	St
1.5.2	A short course in the design would be needed to explain why , beyond the simple answers .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	It does n't really matter because you wo n't even get the 300 in the first place .	St
1.6.2	Besides the fact that no home user has 300m internet wireless technology is half duplex .	St
1.6.3	So to your question , there is no standard defined for the bonding of 2.4 and 5 channels into a single stream .	St
1.6.4	This means if this ability even existed it would a be a proprietary thing which would mean both your nic and your router would have to come from the same vendor .	St
1.6.5	If you want to write your own drivers and firmware it is technically possible I suppose .	St
1.6.6	You could in theory also get 2 completely separate lan connections up if your PC nic allows this , the router more than likely does .	St
1.6.7	But now you have the larger issue of how to use 2 lan connection at the same time .	St
1.6.8	This is the how do I run 2 internet connections question that there is no good answer for .	Ques
1.7.1	The radio is on one band or another .	St
1.7.2	Not both .	St
1.7.3	At least that 's what the spec sheet said .	St
