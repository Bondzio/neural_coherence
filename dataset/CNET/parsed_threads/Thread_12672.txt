<s> hi there, need to know the way of setting my printer to print black and white only, i couldn't find an option to let me print out pages in black and white.... thanks for any help. </s>
<s> also, one of my friend got his printer set up into 2 printer accounts, one's for balck and white and the other is for colour, so when he wants to print colour, he just pull the colour one down the list, just wanna know if my printer allows that to happen. </s>
<s> My experience with printing high quality black and white prints is to pick &quot;greyscale&quot; in the advanced print setup. </s>
<s> The R210 will then use the black cartridge for the black plus a mixture of cartridges for the shades of grey. </s>
<s> It will also show you which cartirdges it will use. </s>
<s> A very nice touch! </s>
<s> I presume for a picture that is just hard black and white, the printer will only use the black cartidge. </s>
<s> However, the R210 will attempt to reproduce as precise a print as it can, so any level of grey will bring the colour cartridges into play, just check in advanced settings. </s>
<s> I hope that helps. </s>
