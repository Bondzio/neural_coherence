it's a &quot;good rule of thumb&quot; to place largest ram first, but that's not absolute.
alot depends on the ram mapping as the mtrbd.
maker usually provides in how ram can be installed.
check the manual, usually this is provided at thier support website for that model mtrbd.
or actual manual or on driver/info cd provided.
good luck -----willy
