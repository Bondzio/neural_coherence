I rececently purchased a wireless network adaptor, while I am waiting for my router to come in the mail. But for some reason I have internet connection in my apartment. I guess I might have connected to someone elses netowork or maybe a &quot;hot spot&quot;. Now while I am using this network, which is not mine, can other people steal file from me?

However, we often turn on WEP, WPA and even MAC filtering to harden the home network. In answer to &quot;can other people steal file from me?&quot; the answer is very likely. Do a little research about the EVIL TWIN problem of wifi hotspots and you quickly learn to distrust unknown spots. Bob
