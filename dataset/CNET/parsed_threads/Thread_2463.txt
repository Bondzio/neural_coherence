<s> I have both IR and RF devices that I want to control with my ipad using it as a remote control. </s>
<s> I have been able to replace my IR remotes but now want to be able to do away with my RF remotes as well. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me how to take the RF signals from my various remotes , and be able to channel through some device and then through my iPAD then to the appliance? </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> But you may have to create and build the last interface with some boards and software. </s>
<s> Unlike the IR controls which is a pure bit on software kit, this requires much more work. </s>
<s> I find many are not ready for this work but as I have done this in the past I do have solid ideas on how to create it. </s>
<s> However there appears to be no off the shelf system to note yet. </s>
<s> If there is something made it would be specific to what you would control. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob . </s>
<s> That is a relief. </s>
<s> I have a home theatre where I want to operate the curtains, screen and blinds that have RF remotes. </s>
<s> Can you tell me how to do it or where I can go to have it done? </s>
<s> I don't know your electronics design background but if I was to build this I would CHEAT BIG TIME. </s>
<s> I'd get something like a IP controlled relay box like http://www.controlanything.com/ Now I can wire up those relays to that curtain or even the RF control device. </s>
<s> Like I said, this is not for a consumer to do but for those that create stuff. </s>

<s> Bob That ius a big help . </s>
<s> Ill see if anyone here can take it further. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> There are more boards like this but the root of this system is to get from the ipad to ANYTHING that I can make to press those buttons or to power that curtain. </s>
