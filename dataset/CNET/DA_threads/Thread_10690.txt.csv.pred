1.1.1	I have a computer from Taiwan which has a SiS 900 Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter.	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to hook it up to my cable modem service.	St
1.1.3	Unfortunately, I can't get it to connect.	St
1.1.4	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	If FE is your abbreviation for fast ethernet, then your issues are probably more along the lines of drivers and common install problems.	St
1.2.2	As least this issue is not one of them.	St
1.2.3	Best of luck, Bob	St
