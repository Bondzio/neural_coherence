1.1.1	Hi all , I was going through these LAN hard disk available nowadays .	St
1.1.2	Seems pretty usefull to have it on the network and then anyone can access it from their own PC .	St
1.1.3	But the problem is of access control .	St
1.1.4	What can we do if we do not want everyone to access every folder .	St
1.1.5	Is there any way to do the access control based on users ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for the help AQ	St
1.2.1	What OS .	St
1.2.2	For example if the OS was Windows NT or later and the external drive was NTFS then NTFS permissions is sufficient .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply , If you are asking for the PC on the network , we have 7-8 PC on the network with most of them running windows XP and one or two on Windows 7 .	St
1.4.1	The machine that & quot ; serves & quot ; up the files would have to have accounts maintained and then we use NTFS permissions to grant or deny each account access to what we see fit .	St
1.4.2	As there are plenty of web pages on NTFS permissions I must stop at that point .	St
1.4.3	Many go nuts over all the maintenance , the tedius account and if you had XP Home the 5 user limit .	Sug
1.4.4	That 's why businesses usually end up on a server .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	But there is no dedicated machine on the network which is always on .	St
1.5.2	All machine are personal systems and they are normally turned off .	St
1.5.3	So if it requires a PC which can be used to set the user profiles , and it can be turned on and off then it should be ok .	St
1.5.4	But if it requires a PC which should be always on then we would have a problem .	St
1.5.5	Can you help me clarify this doubt .	St
1.5.6	Thanks ,	St
1.6.1	Given no two are alike we would have to download the manual for each one and see what user access controls each one offers .	St
1.6.2	Remember there is no standard here for this product type .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks all for the reply .	St
1.7.2	Yups it was right that different HDD have different options .	St
1.7.3	So I searched for the manuals of Western Digital .	St
1.7.4	Finally I bought the western digital book world which offers me the needed functionality .	St
1.7.5	Thanks all for the time .	St
