<s> I bought this EPSON STYLUS CX4700 all in one a week ago. </s>
<s> It can do everything (print, black&white copy, color copy, graysclae scan) EPCEPT color scanning. </s>
<s> When I tried it, it displays the message &quot;Cannot properly communicate with the scanner. </s>
<s> Make sure the scanner is on, properly connected, andproperly set up to scan. </s>
<s> If using a SCSI connection, restart your computer.&quot; (But I have connected it properly for sure!) </s>
<s> then, If I want to use it again, whatever print,scan, or copy, I must turn off and turn it on again to use it. </s>
<s> I thought it might has a problem with the USB. </s>
<s> But I don't sure. </s>
<s> I use Microsoft Windows XP Pro 2002 SP2. </s>
<s> Could anyone help me? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Did you install the associated software and reboot? </s>
<s> It yes, check in device manager to see if the device is detected properly. </s>
<s> Again, if yes, then look on the Epson site for updated drivers or software. </s>

<s> hi ShinYame, Like you, I just bought CX4700 3 weeks ago. </s>
<s> Everything works except the scanner. </s>
<s> I tried everything, reinstalling the software, download latest software and driver, etc, but to no avail. </s>
<s> Both my laptops having the same problem. </s>
<s> I searched and googled and finally I found another forums where some people was having problem with their USB scanner (not Epson) and some one suggested that the USB cable might be the problem. </s>
<s> The USB1.1 cable doesn't have a good shielding compared to the USB2.0. </s>
<s> Today, i went back to the shop and specifically requested a USB2.0 cable. </s>
<s> They gave me a USB Cable from Cooler Master. </s>
<s> On the back of the package it says it's USB1.1 and USB2.0 compatible and it has EMI Shielding. </s>
<s> After I plugged it in, the scanner works perfectly. </s>
<s> I hope this works for you. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Tian </s>
<s> I had the same problem with my Epson All In One DX4200 device. </s>
<s> I could copy and print but not scan. </s>
<s> I have tried everything, from removing background processes, to playing with Control Panel, getting a new cable, chatting with Epson eTalk support etc. </s>
<s> Nothing worked. </s>
<s> Then I installed one USB card on one of my PCI slots. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> It's not the USB ports that have problems, because I use Microsoft wireless mouse on it and a USB card reader which work fine, but those Epson drivers which were definately poorely written. </s>
