<s> I built my own PC a couple years ago, and I discovered recently that my on board USB slots are all USB 1.1 after I tried to transfer some pretty big files to a friends external HD and it took forever. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade to USB 2.0 and mount it in one of my 5.25'' bays so they're in the front. </s>
<s> I've priced USB 2.0 cards, but before I buy one, I want to make sure that it'll work right. </s>
<s> Does the motherboard need to support USB 2.0 for it to work at the higher speeds, or can I just buy a PCI card and be done with it? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I've used all models from newegg.com, geeks.com and they all work in Windows 2000/XP. </s>
<s> I can't tell if other OSes have support. </s>
<s> As to the front panel, USB 2.0 wiring must be used. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> if it is from a pci card, your motherboard will support it. </s>
<s> you can find them that go from the pci card to the front 5.25&quot; bay and yes, it should support it. </s>
<s> I'm backing the last post up..... </s>
