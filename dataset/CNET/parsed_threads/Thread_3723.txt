<s> I found that many pictures on my PC were far too saturated with respect to red and orange. </s>
<s> I changed my color profiles to prophoto rgb, which helped out tremendously--but only in windows picture viewer. </s>
<s> I don't notice any difference at all in terms of desktop color. </s>
<s> The vista sidebar, thumbnails, and non-icc compatible programs all display the hideous oversaturated colors. </s>
<s> I mean, reds practically glow with a supernatural aura. </s>
<s> The monitor has been &quot;calibrated&quot; with visual tools (not spending money on colorimeter) and is accurate within reason with those tools (gamma, brightness, and contrast). </s>
<s> Again, color is awful on the desktop and most other apps except picture viewer. </s>
<s> Hardware: HP Pavilion Elite d5100t ATI Radeon 4850 graphics card HP w2558hc monitor Let me know if any more relevant hardware is required. </s>
<s> I think I managed to answer my own question. </s>
<s> For anyone else who may be wondering the same thing or pulling their hair out over the matter, Windows Explorer is NOT ICC profile-aware. </s>
<s> So Vista/XP itself will not really manifest the color profiles, but your photos, etc. </s>
<s> in aware applications will (like Windows Picture Viewer, Photoshop, etc.). </s>
<s> I confirmed the effects myself by looking at another very new system that features a Samsung T240HD monitor with an Nvidia GTS250 graphics card and it had a very similar cast to all images in Windows Explorer--the same oversaturation of reds and oranges. </s>
<s> I guess this is more of a windows problem for now... </s>
