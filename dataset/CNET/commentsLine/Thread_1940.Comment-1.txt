most reviews are for the older models, so i thought i would get some feedback from actual owners of these machines.
i went to bestbuy to see these machines side by side and the hp seemed to print a photo copy of a picture faster and of slightly better quality, but the epson was low on magenta ink.
the epson's photo was actually redder ( surprising since it was low on magenta).
i wasn't able to test the regular black and white printing function or the scanning.
two separate best buy reps said that the hp was overall the better machine and that the epson tends to waste a higher amount of ink when it comes to loading new ink cartridges.
i had been concerned with some of the problems mentioned regarding the previous hp model and he assured me that hp worked out the kinks.
i wanted to hear from actual users/owners of these two machines to see if this was true.
i am curious as to how the hp does in the scanning area and in long term use.
neither of these machines is cheap so i don't want to be sorry.
my last two printers (lexmark) were junk, both fed paper crookedly and one eventually stopped working after 6 months of very little use.
so i am definitely staying away from lexmark.
my goal is to find a high quality multi-purpose that will do the functions it offers well and will last a long time.
and it has to operate on an mac os x software.
i would love to hear your feedback.
thanks.
