I cannot boot up when the card is installed (Windows XP). PCI slots are OK/not damaged. Is there a known compatibility issue with either this card or computer? Perhaps a BIOS issue?

It's quite possible either you: a. found a card that doesn't work in it. b. overloaded the PSU. c. Have the IDE cable on wrong (try just the card!) d. haven't plugged in the card all the way. Best of luck, Bob
