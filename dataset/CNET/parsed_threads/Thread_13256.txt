<s> I'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming HD video and basically speed everything up. </s>
<s> We still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well. </s>
<s> Is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the Belkin F5D7132 to my new wireless N router? </s>
<s> My understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access. </s>
<s> This forum's sticky has that setup at about post 18. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> I understand basically how to set up the access point. </s>
<s> I think my question is a little more basic. </s>
<s> I need to maintain wireless G access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless N performance. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless N router (D-Link DIR655) will let the router run pure N instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic. </s>
<s> The access point will let my Wii and guests to connect with g. True? </s>
<s> And I rechecked the forum top sticky post. </s>
<s> The setup to use is at post 18. </s>
<s> You're very close to getting it working. </s>
