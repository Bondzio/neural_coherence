1. the cd/dvd drive has aged and can't boot anymore.
try cd/dvd lens cleaners first then a new drive.
2. there are usb things plugged in.
try without.
3. the hdd has one of those boot virus infections.
to fix that has too many solutions from bootable cds to reinstalling the os.
keep supplying clues so other ideas can be put forward.
