I've been looking up solutions for networked storage.
I want it mainly for my computer, so I just want to mainly put movies on it.
I might do music, but I mainly need all the videos off my desktop.
I've looked at the Western Digital drives, but their network ones have a very low score.
I was just wondering what my best bet would be for this, and I'm looking to spend under $200 for 250+GB, even if I need to use my own hard drive.
Any positive help is useful.
Thanks!
