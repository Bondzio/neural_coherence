<s> I have a Dell XPS Studio 7100, with the AMD 6 core Phenom II 1090t CPU. </s>
<s> Recently I changed out my PSU for a future graphics card upgrade, and this is where the problems began. </s>
<s> The Corsair 650 watt PSU went in w/no probs, and my system runs great, even smoother than before. </s>
<s> However... </s>
<s> If I run a stat program like CPU-Z, it shows the V CORE voltage of my CPU is now WAY TOO HIGH like 2.028 volts (it's supposed to be 1.1 or 1.2v according to AMD). </s>
<s> I've checked it on a couple of other programs as well including HW Monitor, AIDA64, and Speccy which all give the same result. </s>
<s> 2 volts or more. </s>
<s> And no- I am not overclocking, you can't on a Dell. </s>
<s> I called Dell, AMD, and Corsair, but they all tell me since my system is stable and not running hot (it's only 31c right now under a light load, and only gets to around 40-42c under heavy load), there is nothing they will do right now. </s>
<s> They basically want me to wait til it fries the CPU or something else and then call them. </s>
<s> The AMD tech support said he thinks the Dell mobo may be &quot;over-volting&quot; the CPU so I should call Dell and tell them. </s>
<s> I did and they didn't agree and said to call Corsair because its a PSU problem, so I have to call them. </s>
<s> When I called Corsair they said since it's only the CPU and not anything else affected, and the system isn't overheating at all- it's likely either AMD's or Dell's issue - not the PSU. </s>
<s> What a run around! </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how I can lower this voltage setting or is this all just false readings? </s>
<s> Bios adjustments are not accessible on Dell's so I can't even check to verify that it's not a false reading. </s>
<s> I'm stumped. </s>
<s> And again..I'm not overclocking. </s>
<s> I even tried to running Crysis 2, while having an Excel spreadsheet open, wih several browser tabs open, and while playing iTunes in the background. </s>
<s> Still no problem- It only got to 40-42c, and was completely stable. </s>
<s> It didn't even phase the 1090t which was laughing at about 20-24% usage. </s>
<s> Any opinions? </s>
<s> I just dont want to fry my CPU or mobo with high voltage. </s>
<s> Dell usually does not allow change of this setting. </s>
<s> That is, unless someone has installed some tweak software it's correct according to Dell. </s>
<s> Sadly some apps like you note read something wrong and folk lose time calling support for no reason. </s>
<s> Your story might be incomplete but so far I see no reason to keep writing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you install the old psu what does that v-core stuff show? </s>
<s> If it shows the same thing then I doubt it's a psu issue. </s>
<s> Yes I put the old PSU back in to double check, but it's the same reading. </s>
<s> It's like the sensor is stuck now on 2 volts. </s>
<s> But again, my system is running great, stable, and cool. </s>
<s> I have sinced put the new Corsair PSU back in, since the voltage readings are the same. </s>
<s> Hardware monitor ITE IT8721 Voltage 0 5.24 Volts [0x69] (+12V) Voltage 1 2.58 Volts [0x7B] (+5V) Voltage 2 2.02 Volts [0xAA] (CPU VCORE) Voltage Values CPU Core 2.028 V Motherboard 30 C (86 F) CPU #1 / Core #1 34 C (93 F) CPU #1 / Core #2 34 C (93 F) CPU #1 / Core #3 34 C (93 F) CPU #1 / Core #4 34 C (93 F) CPU #1 / Core #5 34 C (93 F) CPU #1 / Core #6 34 C (93 F) </s>
<s> Remember that Dell will not respond if it's not. </s>
<s> Are you SURE this ever read less than 2 volts? </s>
<s> Perhaps it has been that way from day 1. </s>
<s> Before I chased this around I'd break out the DVM and see what it really is. </s>
<s> Maybe the sensor fibs. </s>
<s> If the DVM shows 2+ volts and AMD says 1.3 volts I'd call Dell and ask&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How Come? </s>
<s> As mentioned.....you can not use non-Dell software to tell Dell they have a problem......it does not work....they go deaf. </s>
<s> Not possible. </s>
<s> After doing some reading that vcore should be in the 1.2v/1.4v range......depending on turbo or what ever AMD calls it. </s>
<s> Before you could get vcore to 2v+ that cpu would have gone to &quot;cpu heaven&quot;. </s>
<s> The temps look fine. </s>
<s> Ignore the voltage sensor. </s>
<s> Yes, I think youre right bob b. </s>
<s> There is just no way the CPU hasn't gone up in flames if it was really running at 2 volts. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure it was only showing the normal range before I changed out the PSU, but in all honestly I'm not positive. </s>
<s> I really wasn't looking at the VCORE, I was only monitoring the temps. </s>
<s> I've had my computer running for about two hours now, and the CPU temp is only 29c, and the mainboard is 31c (according to Speedfan). </s>
<s> My question is this - If these software based can't read my VCORE accurately, how reliable are the temps they're giving me? </s>
<s> I found them to not be accurate but when they work they were reliable to show me when the temp changed. </s>
<s> Put another way, if it did report 55C and it shot up to 88C while it could be off 10C it reliable did indicate it got hotter. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> If your using one of those monitor progs a good dose of skepticism will come in handy. </s>
<s> I recall using one of those monitor tools that came from the mobo maker......the readings were nutty. </s>
<s> If the mobo maker can't figure out how to get that info from &quot;their&quot; own board what chance does a third party tool have? </s>
