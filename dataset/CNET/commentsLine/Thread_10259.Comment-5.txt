bob, i am not at home right now, so i can't give you complete specifics.
it is a compaq and i bought it used a few years back.
having said that, my complete hard drive was tranfered from the computer that i had long before this compaq that we are talking about now.
beyond that, i can't tell you anything until i get home and see the information you require.
as it is windows 98se, i just assumed that there was a standard windows 98se driver or update that needed to be downloaded.
tell me exactly what you need to know and i will provide that when i get home from work.
thank you very much.
