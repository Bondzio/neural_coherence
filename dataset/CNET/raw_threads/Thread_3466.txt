Say i type on the keyboard and the things I type come out as tect on both PCs. If this is possible, how would I go about setting it up? I would buy 2 wireless keyboards, and set up the 2 recievers, but is there a way to set them to the same frequency? I have never owned a wireless keyboard so im not sure if this is possible or not.

I was told I could only have my monitor, keyboard and mouse all hooked up at once. From what you were saying I could only have my mouse and keyboard hooked up and keep my 2 monitors. Can I just only hook up my mouse and keyboard? If I can just hook up the mouse and keyboard, what is the delay between switching from one PC to the other?

However, I don't believe you can address both units at the same time( at least in my experience). You use a hot key or manual switch to toggle between desktops. If the two machines are networked,you can of course move files between them.

The speed of switching depends on what kind of KVM you get. There are KVM switches that can work with PS/2 or USB keyboards and mice. The PS/2 KVM switch switches between PC's faster than the USB version (1 second vs. 3-4 seconds) because with the USB version, the PC you switch to has to re-recognize the device vis usb.
