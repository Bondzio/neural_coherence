1.1.1	Hello I 've been looking around for a TV tuner that can broadcast my TV at home back to me away from home .	St
1.1.2	So far I 've only been able to find the Slingbox as a viable option .	St
1.1.3	Are there any other types of this kind of device similar to the Slingbox ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks in advance - Nick	St
1.2.1	you could home-brew your own , but slingbox does all the work for you .	St
1.2.2	unless you 're a hobbyist , go with slingbox or get something to convert your programs to divx and burn them to cd/dvd .	St
1.2.3	a single layer dvd can hold 12+ hours of divx high-res video .	St
1.3.1	Something sort of like SageTV ?	Ques
