if you read the last supplied articles, you would not be asking if there is enough power.
i can state there isn't enough.
i can make a fairly safe bet the base machine didn't come with 512m ram (it does take watts!
), the second hard disk and such.
what can you eject?
that 10gb drive is 20 watts or so and 256 m ram isn't too bad compared to it not working.
did you try that plus set the agp rate to 1x?
