ok i'm back.
it was late by the time i posted my last message (i'm in the uk) so didn't get your reply 'til today bob, thanks.
anyway, i've dismantled the pc as you suggested and stripped it down to just memory, floppy and graphics and guess what?
yep, it starts once and posts to tell me there's no keyboard (i'm sure it would have worked with the keyboard) but after shutdown it won't power on again, nothing, no fans, no beeps, nothing.
i'm still using the power switch and speaker from the case and also the original memory module.
could there be a problem with any of those?
can't believe there could be anything wrong with the switch, there's not much to it is there?
i'm aware that i could jumper the power pins on the board instead of using the switch but i'm always nervous of approaching the board when it's got power.
i do recall the speaker sound becoming a bit strangled sounding when the alarm beeps were going off when this sorry story started with the cd drive blowing.
i did of course try it again without the speaker connected, but it was the same old story....nothing.
looks like i'll have to wait some hours now though to try it without the speaker connected or am i clutching at straws?
frustratingly i have no spare pc133 mem modules to check the memory but would it start at all if there was a problem with it?
i don't know what to try next, any more suggestions?
thanks, as always, minskin
