1.2.1	http : //ca.lge.com/en/prodmodeldetail.do ? actType=search & page=1 & modelCategoryId=040103 & categoryId=040103 & parentId= & modelCodeDisplay=L1919S & enlarge= % 2Fen % 2Fdown % 2Fproduct % 2F040103 % 2FM4200C % 2FM4200A_large.jpg & model=8 theres the second link	St
1.3.1	Honestly , I do n't see a difference between the two .	St
1.3.2	The specs are exactly the same for both .	St
1.3.3	If you 're concerned about ghosting , look at the response time , the lower , the better .	St
1.3.4	The only way to tell is to go into the store and look at it yourself .	St
1.3.5	Otherwise you can only rely on specifications alone .	St
1.3.6	I 'd say get whatever one is cheaper .	St
