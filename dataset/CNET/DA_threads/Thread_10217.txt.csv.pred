1.1.1	Hi everybody out there .	St
1.1.2	I have a question .	St
1.1.3	Can i upgrade the dell E521 to a geforce 9500GT from the onboard crappy graphics ?	Ques
1.1.4	The dell forums says its absolutely ok and the power supply will handle the card .	St
1.1.5	the card needs a min of 350W with 18A on +12V rails .	St
1.1.6	But the dell supply is 305W nd has 18A on the 12V rails .	St
1.1.7	Is it possible ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or should i settle for a 8600GT ?	Ques
1.1.9	Pls I need ur help Thank U !	St
1.2.1	Go get a Watt meter like the P3 http : //www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html Armed with that , measure just the machine 's Watt usage and if we want to be conservative if the draw is under 150 or 50 % of that 305 Watts then I 'd go wtih the 9500GT .	St
1.2.2	HOWEVER in one day I 'll be able to measure the draw of the HD 3650 which I chose off this list - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2118.html I ca n't find the 9500GT on that list .	St

1.3.1	it will be really close .	St
1.3.2	i think as long as you only have 1 hard drive and 1 dvd/cd rom you should be ok. ive read a lot that dell underrates their psus .	St
1.3.3	newegg is good with exchanges if it doesnt work out	St
1.4.1	Hey thanks for replyin .	Polite
1.4.2	i only hav 1HDD 1dvd nd d processor .	St
1.4.3	will it b ok ? or will i face problems in d future ?	Ques
1.5.1	you will just have to make your best decision .	St
1.5.2	keep in mind that depending on your cpu and ram , the video card may be overkill if theres a bottleneck in the system somewhere	St
1.6.1	a pci-express x16 slot must provide up to 75w of power .	St
1.6.2	if a card does n't require an additional pci-e power connector ( and the 9500gt does n't ) , then it is designed to run within the normal current of the x16 slot and wo n't need a large power supply .	St
1.7.1	Not your exact card but I installed the following replaced a this with that and here 's the Watt readings of the entire PC before and after .	St
1.7.2	Said PC is a common Core 2 Duo , 2GB RAM , single HD , single DVDRW .	St
1.7.3	Before : Nvidia FX5700 256MB AGP 8X = 105 Watts running Doom After : ATI HD 3650 512 AGP 8X = 135 Watts running Doom If your machine taps as much as mine that 305 Dell Watt PSU should be fine with this type card .	St
