hi everyone.
i recently decided to reinstall windows.
my external hard drives decided to work fine after the reformat.
however, today, i experienced a cmos error after a nasty hard reboot and when i loaded windows again, it was very unstable.
now, my external hard drives aren't detected by windows, and load forever when i click them, and when i unplug them, a message stating that they need to be formatted pops up.
when i try to open them, it says the parameter is incorrect.
also, when trying to view them in disk manager, the window freezes up, not changing until i unplug the device.
the strange thing is that they work perfectly fine on my xp laptop.
system: windows 7 professional x64 evga 790i ultra sli motherboard 1tb western digital mybook external 500gb western digital mybook external thanks.
