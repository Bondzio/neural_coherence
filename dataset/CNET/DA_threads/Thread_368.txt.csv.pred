1.1.1	I have a Linksys WRT54G running as an access point in mixed mode.	St
1.1.2	One machine on my network is approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, and running 802.11b.	St
1.1.3	It seems that the machine in question can only see and connect to the network intermittently.	St
1.1.4	At first i thought it was a low signal strength issue but the level of reliability seems to vary, and when it DOES connect it appears to have a decent signal.	St
1.1.5	There is a moderately high amount of traffic here, we can usually see at least 5-6 networks.	St
1.1.6	I've tried several frequencies to no noticible difference.	St
1.1.7	Any ideas what may be the issue?	St
1.1.8	Bad router?	St
1.1.9	Bad card?	St
1.1.10	Just need more signal?	St
1.1.11	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	&quot; approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, &quot; And you'll not get a good solid 11 mbps connection.	St
1.2.2	Try 1.0 mbps.	St
1.2.3	It's a radio.	St
1.2.4	You are shielding the radios so that's the way it works.	St
1.2.5	What to do?	St
1.2.6	Get closer, put a repeater in between.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'm still curious why it would be so intermittent though?	St
1.3.2	It's either a great signal or no signal...	St
1.4.1	To determine why requires a few million bucks of equipment in some radio site survey truck.	Sug
1.4.2	For well under 100 bucks, a repeater will likely just cure it.	St
1.4.3	Let me share that a microwave oven cohabits this frequency space and is some 1000 Watts.	St
1.4.4	It's not supposed to leak much but I have seen them interfere with Wifi operation.	St
1.4.5	If you want to know why, I must bow out now.	St
1.4.6	If you want to fix it, the repeater will likely cure it.	St
1.4.7	It has so far.	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE MONEY FOR A REPEATER, AND SURE THAT WILL WORK JUST FINE, I SAVED MONEY AND BOUGHT EXTENDED ANTENNAS, AND FOUND THE GAIN JUST ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD.	St
1.5.2	I BOUGHT THE ANTENNAS FROM BEST BUY..... GOOD LUCK DONT BUY A GENERTIC BRAND, I TRIED, AND DIDN'T WORK, LINKSY HAS A DEDICATED PAIR THAT WORKED FOR ME MODEL: HGA7T	St
