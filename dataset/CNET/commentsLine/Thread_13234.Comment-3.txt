i wanted to get some feedback before i started ripping off heat sinks and potentially damaging the processors--since this will be my first dig into a motherboard beyond ram and pci cards.
i am inclined to do this, but i wanted some confirmation first.
from your reply, i assume you feel this is a likely culprit.
does the fact that it still boots etc.
prior to overheating hint that the processors are feasibly still good?
thanks in advance.
