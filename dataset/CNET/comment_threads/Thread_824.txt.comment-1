No I didnt do it.
I got a Gateway pc from my boss.
He formatted the hd so the &quot;work related info&quot; would be gone.
I know what formatting does and I need help to restore it.
It is a 20gb Quantum.
It had win98 on it and also drivers for cdrom, usb and ethernet.
I have a 2gb hd with win 98 on it but no such drivers (base system) I want to run the 2gb as the primary and the 20 gb as the slave so I can reinstall the OS on it.
Any suggestions?
