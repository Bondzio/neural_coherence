Slow boots are defined as it's booting in minutes more than ever before.
You didn't tell the forum how many seconds its taking so in my estimation, that's not the issue.
2. http://shopping.netledger.com/app/site/site.nl/site.ACCT72136/mode.items/sc.2/category.7/it.A/id.315/.f for example is a 100 MHz FSB CPU to fit such a machine.
But if this was my machine, I'd know that any 100 MHz FSB CPU might work.
I'd have to consider my risk quotient to see if I'd pop for this set: http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CEL130015-NB The problem here is that P3's move the FSB up to 133 and we can't tell if you can do that.
Sit the selection of possible items is the 219 dollar unit or this slightly faster Celeron.
My choice?
I wouldn't do this.

To speed up most machines, I find the following helps.
a.
No Pests Allowed.
I run all five tools noted at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 b. CWShredder noted at http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/cwschronicles.html c. STARTER would be used to clean up the startup items.
d. Bring out your dead!
Or rather, be BRUTAL and uninstall any program you haven't used in 2 or 3 months.
Full hard disks run slow.
e. Review Optimizing Windows at either http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm (for Win9x/ME) or http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm (for 2000/XP) f. Toss bloated items like Norton 2004 or System Works out in favor of Free AVG from http://www.grisoft.com g. Get 512 Megabytes.
No more, no less.
