Hi, I have 2 linksys wireless routers, a WRT300N and an old BEFW11S4.
I do not get good signal with the WRT300N even when I'm just a couple rooms away.
I was wondering if it would be possible to connect the old router to the new one so I would be able to have 2 wireless access points in my house.
Thanks
