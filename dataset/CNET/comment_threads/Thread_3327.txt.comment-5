As a quick cure, try resetting the CD printout value to low or &quot;draft&quot; mode and check results.
In other words keep it as simple as possible to reduce &quot;hi-quality&quot; output as that alone puts out alot of ink.
Excluding true media(CD blanks) are decent, as I suspect Epson suggested some Epson brand and/or certain product for best results.
I suggest the above as you mentioned &quot;mixed colors&quot; which is a physical result of too much ink being present before the media can do its job if at all.
Epson has always placed in default mode &quot;hi-qulaity&quot; levels as to that product it may also.
As a further note as per Robert's suggestions, you can't take anything for granted as you may have since you used the same .tif file &quot;as is&quot; and expected same results but two different pgms.
were used.
Time to tweak away.
