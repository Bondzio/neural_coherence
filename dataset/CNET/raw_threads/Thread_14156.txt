If it has the capability have you tried using USB KYBD/MOUSE? This issue could also be created by a malware infection(s) there are several possibilities especially since it sounds as if you may be using this unit on a public network.

Have you tried another keyboard? Just for yuks. Disconnect the mouse.....speakers...usb devices......so that all you have left is the keyboard and monitor. I'm assuming this is a desktop. Any difference when using the bios with the keyboard?
