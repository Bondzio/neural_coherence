<s> Here's the problem (again, I know. </s>
<s> But I fix most of my problems). </s>
<s> I have this NEC Drive, ND-3550A. </s>
<s> It's a burner. </s>
<s> The problem is that it plays some of my DVD movies and some it won't recognize in the drive. </s>
<s> The drive also doesn't recongize my game DVDs. </s>
<s> The drive thinks that there is no DVD in the drive. </s>
<s> This happened after I had installed a No-DVD patch on a game that I wanted to play on 2 computers at the same time but only had one disk. </s>
