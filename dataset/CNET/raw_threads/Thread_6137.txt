You'll divide your available internet bandwidth among the devices using it at any one time. It's that simple. If you're only using one device, you'll have all available bandwidth at your disposal. If you're downloading one one or more connected devices and surfing the web on another, you may experience some slowness depending on your broadband connection speed.

But, frankly, I don't see what's to gain by creating 3 separate networks with only 4 computers.

Adding more to the system of networks to accommodate more users has to potential to cause serious bottlenecks depending on how much and what all these folks download from the internet. It's streaming video and movie downloads that tie up bandwidth. General surfing uses much less. This sounds like a generous move on your part.
