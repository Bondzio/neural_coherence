It comes with two marvell 88se6145 raid controllers built on the motherboard. The issue is that when I use a PCI-express Video card. I cannot get in the Marvell raid controller BIOS during startup (CTRL-M) to set up the raid. I have also tried using many different PCI-Express video cards but same results. When I use a video card in any regular PCI slot or use the one built on motherboard the BIOS option for marvell to set up the raid works fine. I am just guessing that there must be something in the main BIOS that I can tune so that I get the option during startup for Raid setup when using PCI-Express slot in my case for Graphics card. Any tip would be nice.

You have a good issue to call the maker to fix the BIOS. Bob PS. The company that called me on that one and I do not alter, write the BIOS so it was a simple matter that the customer demanded that board and we provided a way to get to that screen just like you did.
