However i am not really sure how to install both, or even if installing both cards actualy makes the computer run faster. i was wondering if anybody could help me out a bit

If you want good perfmance you have to have a SLI bridge. Idk if any of the cards that you metinoed are SLI ready but if they are you might be able to bridge them then you get a small perfomance upgrade. But not really worth it most likely. -sai
