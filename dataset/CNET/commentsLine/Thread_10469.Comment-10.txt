the acer's are very reliable - i have a desktop and laptop.
my desktop is around 2 yrs old now and i had only one problem with it, which technical support easily solved.
that is the big selling point - their after sales service is excellent, which is why i will be buying an acer when i upgrade.
my laptop was bought 2nd hand, out of warranty, and when i had a problem with the cursor i contacted technical support and they solved the problem for free.
an excellent range of computers too.
