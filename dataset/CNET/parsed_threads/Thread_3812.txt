<s> The smaller end of the cable that connects my Iomega 40 GB portable hard drive to my computer has broken off. </s>
<s> I'm leaving in about 20 minutes for Wal-Mart and was wondering if there was a cheap cable i could replace it with? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I got a new cable and it will turn on, but now my computer wont even know that theres a device attached. </s>
<s> It makes a sound when i turn it on, will wait about 10 seconds, then make another sound, never sayin that drive F has been connected or auto-run. </s>
<s> I really dont want to lose 10 gb of data. </s>
<s> B.T.W, I still have the original box, so warranty might be an option (it's about 2 months old) </s>
<s> A really great tech could look at it and possibly touch up the solder work, but bye bye warranty. </s>
