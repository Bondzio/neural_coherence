Hi, I'm new here and not too network-savvy.
I'm trying to go wireless with a desktop PC running Windows XP SP2.
I've got a 2WIRE router which works fine when plugged into the computer via an ethernet cable.
I purchased a Netgear N300 Wireless USB adapter and installed it - it seems to be working fine.
The trouble is that my wireless connection shows &quot;limited or no connectivity,&quot; although the signal strength is &quot;very good.&quot; When I try to repair the connection, it tells me that I could not be assigned an IP address.
At the moment I'm working via the Ethernet cable with no difficulty.
Can someone suggest a reason why the wired connection works but the wireless (from the same router) doesn't, even though it should?
Thanks in advance for any help!
