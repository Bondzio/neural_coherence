<s> The desktop computer was bought three years ago, but was somewhat far from being top-of-the-line. </s>
<s> It cost me a bit over $1200 (Canadian) including the monitor. </s>
<s> I am looking to buy a new computer, and my parents want to buy this older one. </s>
<s> I'll be giving them all the original parts (below), including the Monitor, as well as the few things I added on; a good quality DVD writer and a USB 2.0 PCI card. </s>
<s> I want to know what a fair price is to ask for this. </s>

<s> How about ten bucks. </s>
<s> Would be nice if you could just give it to them ... used PCs aren't usually worth much used and given all they've done for you, that's my first recommendation. </s>
<s> If they absolutely refuse to accept it gratis.....then price it as a 3 yr old PC with no warranty (and too little RAM) relative to the cost of current technology replacement. </s>
<s> Given you can get a current technology PC from Dell for $500 or $600 (US) ... $150 is probably all that's reasonable. </s>
<s> And if that's all you can get for it . </s>
<s> .gifting it to Mom and Dad looks even better. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> or any comparable Canadian second hand site. </s>
<s> This will give you a good idea of what such a machine is worth. </s>
<s> Then I agree with the previous posters that you should be at least in the lower 50% of the price range you find. </s>
