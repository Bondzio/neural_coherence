While the efficiency of the power supply may play a role in actual power being used, the power consumed will depend on the components that you have installed and what you are doing with them.
A power supply rating of 500w versus one rated at 300w is usually a representative of the capability not what it is using.
If you are thinking that a smaller rating will save you electricity, then you are looking at the wrong place.
In order to save on the power being used, you need to remove components that you are not using (NOT recommended).
Do not worry about it.
Changing computers internals to save energy is not an acceptable practice by most.
