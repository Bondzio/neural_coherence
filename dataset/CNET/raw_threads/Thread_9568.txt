One thing I like to do in the evening is get a radio program on the internet and listen to it in another room. Right now we have wires running from the computer room clear thru to the other side of the house where speakers are. Needless to say, we are always tripping over the wires. Is there a way to do this wirelessly, and if so, how? Thanks for any help you may offer.

There are a couple just like that from diff manufacturers. It ok, although the support is crappy. I did have it up and running with almost no problems. Read reviews on amazon, it helped me avoid problems. Could not get the internet radio to work as their firmware is not updated. You can listen through your normal stereo or though the provides speakers. Good luck http://www.linksys.com/products/group.asp?grid=33&scid=38
