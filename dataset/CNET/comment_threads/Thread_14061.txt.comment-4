I thought we didn't connect it to the WAN/Modem port.
You only wanted the hub ports to work?
Remember that I tend to use the networking lingo so when you ask me about a switch, I'll include the non-switched hub as well unless you write more.
When we use these DSL modems for the switch, we would never use the WAN port.
That's a given.
