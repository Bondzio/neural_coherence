I just read about an interesting font, called &quot;Ecofont.&quot; It supposedly saves 20% of the typical ink used by a laser printer. The site is here: http://www.ecofont.eu/look_at_ecofont_en.html Anyways, I'm wondering about this claim. It is made on the basis that the letters in this font have small white circles throughout the letters, which is plainly visible if you print it in a large font size; and barely so at 12 point font. My question--will this in fact save ink? I have looked at the Draft mode within MS Word, but that hardly is any different from the normal mode. My laser printer (HP 1018) has an &quot;economode&quot; setting which obviuosly uses less ink, but is a bit of an eyesore. I hand out a lot of material that is hard to comprehend and I can't afford folks to be put off by a hard-to-read printout. This appears to be the only real option I have to save ink, but I'm wondering--will this in fact save any ink? Or is the mechanics of laser printing such that it really won't save anything? If not, I'd rather not even bother with changing fonts from Times New Roman to this and then back again. Any thoughts?

It looks pretty crummy on a word processor but it prints out just fine. Or was this your way of saying that this claim of saving 20% is just an illusion?

The method is as old as the printing press so let's not think this is a new idea. I see the optical illusion issue and dug up a picture to show the issue. What I am saying is the font needs work. But the premise is sound. Bob

He says that any ink savings depends on what font you typically print with. He calculates (by comparing pixels to dots of ink on a paper) that serif fonts (Times New Roman is the most common serif font) actually consume a lot less ink than this font, though. However, compared to some sans serif fonts, you can save 20%--but again, the savings depend on what font you use. http://farlukar.110mb.com/stuff.php#ecofont

Not only ink is expensive, the printers do a great job spending it! I recently found a software utility, PretonSaver Home, that &quot;turns&quot; every font to eco-font. It reduces ink consumption by up to 70% and provides excellent print quality. I did not have to change the fonts I use or change the way I print. PretonSaver works in the background and very smartly optimizes the ink/toner used by my printers. Try it for free. Download PretonSaver from halftheink.com ( http://www.halftheink.com )

The basis of using ink in the 100% use of the nozzles will produce ink overrun(excess) which in turn makes for a solid printed output. What is typical of so-called ink control is the non-firing of adjacent ink nozzles causing less ink usage and the &quot;ink overrun&quot; will still cover the missed spaces and for most fonts being used appear OK or at least for plain text offer reasonable results. Alot depends on the font being used, the paper, and printer printhead in general. If a printhead has say, 50 ink nozzles will show better results than one with 40. The paper itself due to &quot;ink sop&quot; or ink absorbing quality. As for the font itself, they lend a pattern for output to be done and if less dense, on its own merits becomes less effective is even more non-print pattern is followed. Savvy??? To answer your question, yeah they do work. But, to what degree is up to the ink control(driver) being used. The eco-font in question is just proving a print pattern(bit map) that is using less ink nozzles to create that font. tada -----Willy
