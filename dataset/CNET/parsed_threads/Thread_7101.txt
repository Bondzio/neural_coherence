<s> Hi everybody, I formated my hard disk, so now it can not boot at all. </s>
<s> I would like to know how to create a bootable hard disk. </s>
<s> (My OS is WINDOWS ME). </s>
<s> Please help ! </s>
<s> Thank. </s>
<s> Of course, this will cause it not to boot. </s>
<s> I would ask what you used to format the drive and why? </s>
<s> All you should really need is your CD of Windows to install the OS. </s>
<s> You need to set your BIOS to look to the CD ROM drive as the first boot device. </s>
<s> Insert the ME CD and restart the PC. </s>
<s> Presuming you have a genuine full version of Windows ME, that should be all you need. </s>
<s> It's an upgrade version, you need to be prepared to present a qualifying upgrade disk at the appropriate time. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> Hi Steve Haninger, Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I'll try to format my hard disk again but I don't have an upgrade version of Windows ME... </s>
<s> Thank again. </s>
