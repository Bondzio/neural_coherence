<s> The main thrust of this discussion should be the antitrust particulars, i.e., is what Intel is doing a violation of antitrust law? </s>
<s> I am not an attorney so this is just one users opinion; consider the facts. </s>
<s> Large corporations enter into business agreements which exclude competition by agreeing to supply product 'as needed' i.e., you get yours' first. </s>
<s> Sounds good, however, these 'agreements' can lead to very unsavory business practices. </s>
<s> For instance: Go out and obtain the retail price a 'single' Intel processor. </s>
<s> The cost exceeds the sale PRICE of a widely advertised computer. </s>
<s> How can this be possible?? </s>
<s> Certainly not a volume thing. </s>
<s> How about the following scenario: Supplier to manufacturer &quot;How would you like to get 'x' thousand of these processors at this VERY low price&quot;? </s>
<s> &quot;You could really sell a lot of product and make it very hard on your competition&quot; I believe that this is called 'dumping' and is frowned upon universally. </s>
<s> Who do I support?? </s>
<s> AMD; they have a better product and are being squashed by a bigger company. </s>
<s> Sound familiar -- how about Apple and that little company up north? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> your input into the threrad that has already been running for a few days? </s>
<s> Are you aware that had you put it there the thread percolates to the top??? </s>
<s> I didn't take time to see if you posted there. </s>
