try booting up into safemode and go back to device mgr.
go to the sound category, click the plus mark if it's not already opened up, right click the legacy device, and choose properties.
once there, look for the box that says disable in all hardware profiles and put a check mark in it.
click ok, and then reboot to see if the problem persists or if it fixes it.
