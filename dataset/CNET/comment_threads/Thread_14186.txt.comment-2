but I've never had faith in these HD utilities as cloning tools.
I use Drive Image (now a Symantec product).
These are not file copy utilites.
They copy sector information and can deal with different drive geometries and partition sizings do to their special technologies.
They cost too much for one time use but have other advantages and incorporate well into backup schemes.
There are free cloning tools but I paid for mine and it's never failed me.
