1.1.1	I currently have a few users from my company using Cisco VPN client 5.0.06 .	St
1.1.2	Sometimes when they 're away , they can not connect to the hotel or airport wireless network using the Cisco VPN Client .	St
1.1.3	I have investigated and it seems that sometimes the router they are trying to connect to is not compatible with Cisco VPN Client protocols .	St
1.1.4	( well..most of the times ) My question is : is there a better solution that Cisco VPN Client , one that will allow them to connect to any type of router that airports and hotels are using ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	But I 'm getting ahead of myself here .	St
1.2.2	This is not an answer to how to get VPN to work across routers that do n't do VPN but what I see companies do for the mobile troops .	St
1.2.3	Ready ?	Ques
1.2.4	They put what is needed up on a web server with a https : // interface .	St
1.2.5	Secure http is the next step and your company moves from VPN to web interfaces for the workflow .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	More than likely they do not allow IPSEC though their gateway .	St
1.3.2	This is the & quot ; old & quot ; way to do VPN client .	St
1.3.3	The new way is to use SSL since that passes though anything since it runs on the HTTPS port .	St
1.3.4	IPSEC either runs on udp 4500 or using native IPSEC on protocol 50 and UDP 500 .	St
1.3.5	A lot of providers of wireless are not technically competent enough to allow IPSEC or they choose not to avoid the support headache .	St
1.3.6	Cisco new client is called anyconnect but you really do n't need any software preload on clients if you do n't want to .	St
1.3.7	The appliance will download the correct version of the client when you log on .	St
1.3.8	This is so much easier to use and maintain than the ipsec based clients .	St
1.3.9	The big BUT here is that you must have new enough & quot ; appliances & quot ; to support anyconnect .	St
1.3.10	Cisco has changed the way they do their vpn licenses since many people where & quot ; stealing & quot ; the client and connecting to a non cisco vpn concentrator .	St
1.3.11	If you are going to have to replace your vpn appliance to run SSL you may want to also look at juniper ( netscreen ) vpn appliance at least get bids to use against each other .	St
1.3.12	If you want to play with the anyconnect product the smaller routers ( ie cisco 2800 ) have a built in free 2 license version of cisco ssl vpn appliance .	St
1.3.13	If your company is very small using a router rather than a ASA box is much cheaper .	St
