Western Digital drives.
If you hear that clicking noise when the drive's flat data cable is disconnected from the drive and the drive is ONLY connected to its power cable, then I'm afraid your drive is unable to put itself &quot;online&quot; and is completely inaccessible from the outside world.
This &quot;power cable only&quot; test is what the Western Digital Technical Support people had us perform in order to diagnose a dead drive ... and it's conclusive.
If, however, this clicking happens later on, after the drive is up and running and you're only trying to read a particular file -- then the great majority of your data probably is recoverable.
Western Digital's is Data Lifeguard Tools http://support.wdc.com/download/index.asp#dlgtools They also have a diagnostic program you can run from their site that will check the drive and tell you if it's ok or not.
Your drive may still be under warranty and they will replace it as well.
If it's not a WD drive, let us know....I have links to other mfr sites that have similar tools available.
