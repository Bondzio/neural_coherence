hi guys i bought my pc from pc specialist just over 2 years ago.
no problems at all up until now.
i was streaming a film on netflix the other day and got a cpu at 90c warning, before i could even shut it down it hit 100c and shutdown.
i've since removed the old thermal paste and reapplied using the dot in the centre method and made sure the heat sink is properly screwed in, i then set the cpu fan profile to be very aggressive.
was able to turn it back on and the temps stayed around 40c with random spikes to 70c.
as soon as i do anything like stream or anything more intensive same thing happens and the temp shoots to 100c.
in the asus motherboard program it says the cpu fan is running at about 1600rpm at 100%.
so it seems the cpu eco cooler is still working, heat sink has been reseated, fan profile increased, etc.
nothing seems to be working.
do you guys think the cpu is messed up somehow?
there doesn't seem to be any leaks from the cpu water cooling system and fan program says the cpu fan is running.
what else could it be?
really appreciate the help guys, i really need to use my pc as well my specs are: i7 2600k oc'd to 4.2ghz coolit eco c240 alc cpu water cooling arctic cool mx3 thermal compound hah 922 with large side panel intake fan asus p8p67 rev3.0 corsair tx750 gtx 670 ftw 8gb 1600mhz ram looking forward to seeing some more experienced people's thoughts on the matter, thanks guys, appreciate it greatly
