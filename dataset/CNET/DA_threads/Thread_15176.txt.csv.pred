1.4.2	No, Standard PCI Graphics Adapter is not your video card, that's just a generic Windows supplied driver for it.	St
1.5.1	When I checked my video drivers on my system it showed that they were operating properly.	St
1.5.2	I was able to ask my system to go to 256 colors but when I restarted my computer, it went back to 16 every time.	St
1.5.3	After talking to our IT server guy, I found our box of software and located the CD that had the original Video Drivers on it.	St
1.5.4	I installed it (it kept asking if I wanted to keep my current files...they were newer...I said yes each time until the process was complete).	St
1.5.5	After the install was complete it automatically restarted my computer and I was set up with 256 colors.	St
