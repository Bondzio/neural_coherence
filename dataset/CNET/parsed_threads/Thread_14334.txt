<s> I am new to the forum and not overly computer savvy. </s>
<s> I have a Mac and a PC at home, and I want to link the internet modem if not both computers, together using a wireless router. </s>
<s> However, my spouse does banking on-line and is not comfortable with a wireless router. </s>
<s> So, can one computer be wired and the other wireless? </s>
<s> Or is there a way to switch between wired and wireless such that when she wants to do banking, there are no hotspots as it were? </s>
<s> The setup would look like wall &gt; isp modem/router &gt; wireless router &gt; wired/wireless You would be able to plug the ethernet cable into the wireless router that you purchase, popular brand of your choice. </s>
<s> Remember to update the firmware in the wireless router. </s>
<s> They sit in the warehouse with outdated firmware. </s>
<s> Broadcast SSID Use WPA Personal security This will make it safe to use and no one from the neighborhood can access your network. </s>
