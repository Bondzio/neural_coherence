<s> I just extended an existing LAN by plugging an ethernet cable into a wireless router. </s>
<s> Generally it works fine. </s>
<s> However the internet connection through the router is much slower then through the ethernet cable. </s>
<s> I' ve been using the same router at home before and did not notice any difference in connection speed between etherenet and wireless there. </s>
<s> However at home I only had 2 machines attached to the network. </s>
<s> Looking at the router configuration utility under &quot;attached devices&quot;, I can now see 6 further machines attached to the router. </s>
<s> These are from the existing LAN. </s>
<s> Are the possibly using up the bandwidth? </s>
<s> Is that normal, since these machines are connected through ethernet cables, not wireless. </s>
<s> THanks for help, Gleb </s>
<s> Wifi is also half duplex from what I've seen. </s>
<s> Even at 11 megabits per second, web pages are fine. </s>
<s> It's when you copy a file the speed feels pinched. </s>

<s> That's what I figure, 11 megabits should not be the bottle neck for the internet access. </s>
<s> But I can see the difference between the wired / wireless </s>
<s> As I noted, it's not full duplex and the delays can add up as some interference can knock a packet out and its resent. </s>
<s> I think the Wifi industry is overselling this product. </s>
<s> It's good, but they don't want to talk much about such things. </s>
