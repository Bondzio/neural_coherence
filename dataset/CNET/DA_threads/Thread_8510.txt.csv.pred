1.1.1	Hello , I inherited a Bretford Netbook 32 cart with no instructions .	St

1.1.3	Could anyone tell me exactly how I configure these ?	Ques
1.1.4	Which ones do I plug in at which time ?	Ques
1.1.5	Also , can anyone direct me to an online instruction manual ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thank you , Lisa	St
1.2.1	http : //www.officedepot.com/a/products/158346/Bretford-Basics-NETBOOK32-Laptop-Storage-Mobile/ For such a price ( $ 1500 ) it should be possible to locate the maker and its customer service .	St
1.2.2	Kees	St
1.3.1	Yes , this cart .	St
1.3.2	I got it second hand , so not sure if the maker will help , but a good idea to try .	St
1.3.3	Thank you , Lisa	St
1.4.1	I do n't think it was a Bretford , however , but did have 32 slots .	St
1.4.2	It 's design was accommodate 32 netbook sized PCs and act as a charging station .	St
1.4.3	The one I did had only 2 power cords that went external to the cart but there were 3 or 4 cords in total .	St
1.4.4	On the back side of the cart were 2 power strips with probably 20 outlets each for a total of 40 outlets .	St
1.4.5	The power cord for each of these outlet strips connected to a timer inside the same cabinet .	St
1.4.6	The timer box had the longer power cord attached that went to a wall outlet .	St
1.4.7	The timer would cycle the power to the outlet strips so that only one would be & quot ; hot & quot ; at a time and would alternate between the two .	St
1.4.8	This reduced the load at any given time .	St
1.4.9	Another power cord went to a pop-up accessory outlet for the top of the cart .	St
1.4.10	On the one I did , we placed a printer on the cart with a wifi print server .	St
1.4.11	The accessory cord supplied power to those as , when the cart was rolled into a classroom for use , the charging circuit cord was not needed ... .only the accessory cord if printing was to be done .	St
1.4.12	There were separator panels between each netbook .	St
1.4.13	These panels were constructed to allow attachment of a charger for each netbook .	St
1.4.14	The wiring wrapped ( fairly ) neatly around the panels and there were holes drilled that would allow cable/zip ties to hold the charging bricks securely .	St
1.4.15	Each charger cord went into an outlet on a power strip .	St
1.4.16	It was a good idea to follow some scheme so you 'd know which tier ( upper or lower ) of netbooks was receiving charging power at any given time .	St
1.4.17	I ca n't direct you to a manual but I can tell you that , once you get into the thing , how to hook it up should just about hit you in the face .	St
1.4.18	Good luck with it .	Polite
1.5.1	http : //bretford.com/resources/downloads/instructions/B_NETBOOK32_ % 28031_8115 % 29.pdf It 's not step by step but it 's something that might be useful .	St
1.5.2	Their site does have more .	St
1.5.3	This is the one I did .	St
1.5.4	I lied ... it 's only got 30 compartments .	St
1.5.5	It was fairly easy to figure out .	St
