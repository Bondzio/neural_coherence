I bought an area 51-7500 and it took 2 months to get here, and i got the blue screen right out of the box. I sent it back for repairs got it back today, and just got the blue screen again while trying to download photoshop. I am done with Alienware. Can anyone please suggest a good reliable company where I can get a real High performance computer. My budget is no more then 5k, with the monitor included. I looked at the XPS but I couldnt find it with the intel 6800, which is one thing I deff. want. Can anyone here help me out? I appreciate it alot, thanks.

Which is about 800 bucks. I have to pay alienware 800 bucks for sending me a system that didnt work. I cannot believe this.

Did you ORDER the Correct machine for the Software and hardware.. .. Example...for Multi-Media you really need a Pentium 4 Processor as minimum..the Celeron D is a Audio ONLY CPU.. .. Also if you ordered a Video Card installed I might check that for the problem-since that's an ADVANCED User's part..your supplier might have that installed wrong.. .. If this is your First PC/your definitely in trouble on the money side.. It may have a Built in Defect from the Supplier..and if you intercede thay can PULL the WARRANTY.. You may want to CONTACT a Consumer Advocate in your Local Area for help on the issue of a defective PC.

Go to Circuit CITY to make a purchase..Circuit CITY has a Good Customer Service policy.. I just built my first PC/but the LENOVO Brand seems really interesting.. .. DELL makes great PC's and Laptops..but you fairly well get stuck w/the configuration you intitally purchased..upgrades are risky.. .. TOSHIBA makes great products.. .. SONY/is expensive....I quess there are SONY fans out there..I have a SONY Burner Drive(its excellent).. .. PanaSonic makes LapTops called TOUGH-Books..take a look there.. .. ACER...I saw an ACER at Circuit CITY-a LapTop...didn't need a LapTop but was vert tempted..nice Priced LapTop.. .. $$5000.00 will get you one heck of a PC.
