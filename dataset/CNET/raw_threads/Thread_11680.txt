If nothing seems to address the issue, look at the MSCONFIG file. Goto-&gt;start-&gt;run-&gt;type in MSCONFIG-&gt;click startup button-&gt;uncheck Lightroom2-&gt;save or apply and exit out. You may have to reboot and try it. If none of this works, uninstall Lightroom2 entirely. Make note where you installed 1st(directory) and totally delete it once the uninstall procedure has been done. Reboot and then re-install Lightroom2, if it requires some preference then, make note of it. Here you can now change how you want it to load. tada -----Willy

To change/disable that or make at least ask again, try: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715 Once done and disabled, it won't autorun. However, you still need to close the pop-up, do that and then the plugged-in device will be available. If for some reason you want to act upon certain type files(association) then whenever those files are part of the autorun mode, this is what I believe what has happened in your case, IMHO. Now that autorun is disabled, no pgm. will autostart again, unless you change it as it will always ask during that pop-up. tada -----Willy
