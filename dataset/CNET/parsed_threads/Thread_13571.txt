<s> Im making a computer for the first time. </s>
<s> Im doing this partially to get to know the inside of the computer, partially to start a new hobby and partially cause i need a new computer. </s>
<s> my budget is pretty low cause im pretty young and cause i dont need it to be extremely high end. </s>
<s> just looking for advice on what i can do to have it run at an average load and small computer games (mainly World of warcraft on low graphics if i decide that i want to go back to that). </s>
<s> the link to my plans are https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1bmBxNbkaSkUHAOm62OVIH4SQyGlTEUDb4-zCrN6_6ns&authkey=CJDijwg&hl=en# . </s>
<s> any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Sorry it has taken a while to get a response to you (technical difficulties at CNET forums, I have read); while your build components look alright, they don't leave much (if any) room for upgrading in the future. </s>
<s> Another thing to consider when building from the ground up (so to speak); is that you will have to factor in the cost of an Operating System, this can increase the cost from $0 (if you're thinking about installing Linux) to several hundred dollars depending on the level of Windows or Mac you want to install. </s>
<s> I am also building a computer as we speak as well and I was just wondering if you know to the power supply will supply enough power to all your components? </s>
<s> Im building a gaming rig and am going with a 1000watt power supply because it provides the power needed and a good base for upgrading the whole system in the future. </s>
<s> Plus if you put in a power supply and it doesnt provide enough power to your system it will crash, fry and have a possibility of taking down other components in your computer with it. </s>
