1.1.1	I have a Microsoft Notebook 5000 Mouse which Ive had for just under a year and up until a week ago it worked great .	St
1.1.2	I have a HP tx1219 Notebook which has Vista Home Premium and of course its Bluetooth capable .	St
1.1.3	My issue is I will be using the mouse and then if I stop for 10mins , 30mins , an hour or any other amount of time and when I go to use it again it wont work .	St
1.1.4	Ive replaced the batteries of course , the only way I can get it working again is to remove it and reinstall it .	St
1.1.5	Thats really getting annoying so Im hoping someone can give me a fix for this .	St
1.1.6	Thanks everyone .	Polite
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & safe=off & q=Turn+off+a+usb+port+power+save+option & btnG=Search	St
1.3.1	Im sorry Im a little confused , I went to the link you posted but it had info on USB ports , could you give me a little more info .	St
1.3.2	Thank you for your time and advice .	St
1.4.1	It 's an old problem with a common setting we change to see if that cures it .	St
1.4.2	If trying this is too hard or unacceptable it 's time to use another mouse or take it to a service counter .	St
1.4.3	The links are so you can learn about the issue and possibly fix it yourself .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I appreciate any help people are willing to give me more than anyone would know , but the Sarcasm and rudeness is a little offensive .	St
1.6.1	Hmmm , really sounds odd , obviously it is n't a battery problem .	St
1.6.2	It could be just a bad mouse but then again it works ( temporarily ) once you reinstall it .	St
1.6.3	Take a look in DEVICE MANAGER at your B/T antenna status , it is possible that it could be an issue with that and if you are lucky maybe a software ( driver update ) might do the trick , give it a shot .	Sug
1.6.4	My first guess would be the mouse and of course the only way to test that is with another mouse but I would still do the update from DEVICE MANAGER just for drill .	St
1.6.5	Good luck !	Polite
1.6.6	!	St
1.7.1	I offered a search page so you can pick the article you like .	St
1.7.2	If you find such too hard to read and make the change , print out one about the change to try and have the person who helps you with your PCs do this for you .	St
1.7.3	I 'm aware that we should n't have to do arcane things but it is Windows so you get to learn about such .	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	I trying to figure out what the Bluetooth has to do with USB .	St
1.8.2	Im sorry if I dont get it , but could you put it into sime terms ?	Ques
1.8.3	Thank you	St
1.9.1	Sorry my keys are a bit sticky , let me fix the spelling I asked if you could put things into simple terms	St
1.10.1	It 's one setting in some control panel so go do it or get it done .	St
1.10.2	Some like a longer reply about USB like this one - & gt ; http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html ? messageID=3002781 & tag=forums06 ; posts # 3002781 If there is something missing from the instructions please tell me which article you are using and which paragraph you are stuck on .	St
1.10.3	Again , this is Windows .	St
1.10.4	It has issues like this so we sometimes get to deal with it or just take it in to the shop .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	Many bluetooth adapters are connected via USB which is why I suggest you try to & quot ; Turn off a usb port power save option & quot ; and why I gave you links to articles about how to do that .	St
1.11.2	Sorry if I do n't explain how a PC is built or works .	St
1.11.3	This is a small box to type into and for that sort of discussion we have to use web pages and more .	St
1.11.4	Does that clear up why I suggested changing that setting ?	Ques
1.11.5	Bob	St
1.12.1	I checked the settings in the Device Manager , then USB Root Hub Properties , Power Management and the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power , was not checked so I guess thats ruled out that being the problem .	St
1.12.2	Does anyone have any other ideas ?	Ques
1.12.3	Please	St
1.13.1	You try it both ways .	St
1.13.2	Sorry it took this many tries to get to that setting but I see where many would not connect BT with USB .	St
1.13.3	Sorry , it 's a common issue and Windows is known to not work the same all around .	St
1.13.4	If you try it the other way and it fails , put it back , retest and if it fails start calling the makers of the laptop and mouse for warranty support .	St
1.13.5	Bob PS .	St
1.13.6	Yes .	St
1.13.7	Not only do I have a BT mouse ( logitech v470 ) which I use on my HP dv6910us but I 've written PalmOS PDA BT capable software and now am re-writing my applications for Windows Mobile .	St
1.13.8	This gives me some insight to bluetooth but as I can see above many will not get the USB BT connection at first .	St
1.13.9	PPS .	St
1.13.10	And yes there are issues in & quot ; Blue tooth stacks. & quot ; I do n't want to open that discussion since when you find that , it 's a warranty issue .	St
