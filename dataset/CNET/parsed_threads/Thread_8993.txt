<s> with dsd 150 already connected. </s>
<s> are laptops still protected when away from the network. </s>
<s> OR how do I run a separate antivirus for the laptops when away from secure spot. </s>
<s> There was some that thought that while you were on a LAN you didn't need AV or firewalls. </s>
<s> Sadly this is not true with Windows machines. </s>
<s> -&gt; Since such is free, why would we go without protection? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so then how do I run an antivirus software for a laptop when it is detatched from the safespot network at home. </s>
<s> Tell us exactly why you think you have antivirus protection only when on your own network. </s>
<s> You're the first poster I've ever seen make a claim the home network is a &quot;safespot.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> this adapter I am talking about is a total network security device. </s>
<s> its attatched between the modem and router. </s>
<s> it secures the network. </s>
<s> my network is a desktop two laptops and a itouch. </s>
<s> I am wondering, if the laptops and or the itouch is used away from the s-link device, how do I run an antivirus on these portable computers.. if its possible. </s>
<s> I am assuming I can: disable the antivirus when I'm connected to the network, and enable the antivirus when I'm away. </s>
<s> is this posible, </s>
<s> Note that: -&gt; The firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you're not protected. </s>
<s> -&gt; The antivirus protection from McAfee must be installed on each computer. </s>
<s> That will work even when your computers are not connected to that device. </s>
<s> -&gt; You should never disable your antivirus protection, even when connected to that device. </s>
<s> -&gt; You should always use a firewall...you need to install a software firewall for use when you're away from the D-Link device. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> thats about what I thought. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> things are running great. </s>
<s> this gagets pretty neat. </s>
<s> seems to secure the home network. </s>
<s> I'll keep antivirus running when I'm disconnected from the network. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
