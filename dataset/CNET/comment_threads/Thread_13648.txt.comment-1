Hi, I just built my first computer and it actually works!!
The issue I'm having is there is no sound.
The motherboard I purchased has a sound jack, so I thought I didn't need a sound/audio card.
Do I need to add a sound card, install a driver from of the CDs that came with motherboard, other???
And yes, I checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer.
Here's the link to the motherboard I bought.
