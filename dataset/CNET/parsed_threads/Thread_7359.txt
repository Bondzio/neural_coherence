<s> Hey, I am having a bit of a problem. </s>
<s> Recently, I was stupid and folowed a tutorial on how to make your computer faster. </s>
<s> The tutorial worked, but now my printer doesn't work. </s>
<s> The tutorial told me to go into MSCONFIG and shut down programs that were running in the backgrounds. </s>
<s> I did, and now this. </s>
<s> I am trying to print out a word document, and whenever I click print I get &quot;Word cannot print because there are no printers detected&quot;. </s>
<s> So then, I put in my printer install disk, the first thing that comes up is &quot;This Printer Cannot Be Installed Because the Print Spooler Service Is Not Running&quot;. </s>
<s> Okay, so I did a search for this spooler service, and I got an EXE File. </s>
<s> I double clicked it, nothing happened. </s>
<s> Since I thought this was a background-running application, I thought nothing of it and tried to reinstall the printer. </s>
<s> I got that same &quot;This Printer Cannot Be Installed Because the Print Spooler Service is Not Running&quot; message. </s>
<s> All I want to know is how can I reinable this print spooler service and get my printer working again? </s>
<s> Start&gt;Programs&gt;Control Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Services. </s>
<s> Scroll down to Print Spooler Service. </s>
<s> Change Startup Type to Automatic and then under Service Status press Start. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I tried that method and I got an error message </s>
<s> I still haven't gotten this fixed, so I'm just bumping this up so people will see it. </s>
<s> Thx </s>
