I got the AMD X2 4400 with 1 gig ram, and a Geforce 6800gt. Multitasking, unbelievabley fast. I unpacked it, activated Windows and away it went. No problems at this time. The only complaint I have is that there was an AOL incon on the desk top for a free trial, but it was only there for a second. No other garbage software.

The software is easy to delete but try cancelling your service and you'll understand the meaning of persistence and torment. Good luck. Jim

I can't believe AOL remains in business!! I am running spyware and Avast virus protector. You buy a Dell and it is loaded with crap software. I recommend Velocity, it rocks!!
