<s> HI we have 5 PCs with windows 2000 installed and ADSL router (4 ports, without USB connector) and a Switch. </s>
<s> we need to set one PC as a server or Administrator so we get the internet from it and not directly from the router. </s>
<s> the server should have the ability to allow and block any one to access the Internet and even to denies some functions. </s>
<s> Any advice would be appreciated. </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> Routers today may have such management tools. </s>
<s> Such would be much easier to do such controls. </s>
