most computers either come with a set of disks to recover your computer to out of box condition or has a feature to make a set of recovery disks to correct problems just like yours.
they also have a d partition on the hard drive that has a recovery program.
there are several free programs such as rkill, malwarebytes, superantivirus and others that don't cost anything except the price of a blank cd and the time to run them.
there are free antivirus programs you can download and run, just google &quot;free antivirus programs&quot; and choose one.
some isps will give you free antivirus programs just for subscribing to their service.
in my case i am with comcast and they supply norton 360v5 at no charge.
