Eithier one is a good choice, I have the Creative SB Audigy Plattinum.
With a good 5.1 or 7.1 you will have some good sound I have both Logitech 680 & Logitech 5500 5.1 systems.
(And Wow what good sound).
There are a lot off good speaker systems out there, it is to ones taste.
To the one wanting a answer: Good Luck Wendell H
