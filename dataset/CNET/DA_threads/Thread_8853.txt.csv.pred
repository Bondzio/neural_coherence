1.1.1	I was looking at the user opinions on the CNET website for the Dazzle DVC 150 Digital Video Creator , and the reviews are horrible .	St
1.1.2	The thing is , a lot of them said the hardware was fine , but the software is horrible .	St
1.1.3	I do n't really get what they mean by software ( it its the editing software or something else ) , but if I was n't going to use the Pinnacle Software , would it be fine for me ?	Ques
1.1.4	I am planning to use Ulead Videostudio Software .	St
1.2.1	The USB connection required that the owner 's PC USB support be & quot ; there & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	You ca n't imagine the number of posts about USB problems .	St
1.2.3	As such , I toss about 1/2 the bad reviews out just because many ca n't resolve USB issues .	St
1.2.4	On top of that there is no support from Dazzle to help you fix your PC 's USB issue .	St
1.2.5	I 've used the Dazzle products and like them .	St
1.2.6	But then I never have an USB issue .	St
1.2.7	The software is , of course dated now .	St
1.2.8	Plus those on DOS based OSes will scream about 4 GB file limits and what else will occur on the DOS based OSes .	St
1.2.9	I know this is not a full answer , but do consider that the user reviews do have issues .	St
1.2.10	If you want a little better solution , try some PCI TV capture card .	Sug

1.3.1	I absolutely HATED the Pinnacle Studio software it came with though and it worked perfectly for me with Power VCR-DVD .	St
1.3.2	Too bad you ca n't just buy the device without the software Pinnacle tosses at you , but the drivers for the device are on the same installation cd .	St
1.3.3	If you buy it , just leave Pinnacle installed and ignore the program completely ... ..and set the default program to be the one you will be using instead .	St
1.3.4	TONI	St
1.4.1	I was thinking of going with a Pinnacle Systems Studio AV/DV Version 9 Video Editing Kit , http : //www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? logon= & langid=EN & dept=0 & sku_id=0926INGFS10040467 & catid=20401 & newdeptid=20374 http : //www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? logon= & langid=EN & dept=18 & sku_id=0665000FS10040467 & catid=10526 & newdeptid=18 because the salesperson told me the Dazzle and this are pretty much the same except one is internal and one is on USB .	St
1.4.2	or ...	St
1.4.3	I was thinking about getting a TV Tuner , because the TV Tuner would kinda be an added bonus that I might use in the future - although the salesperson told me that the quality may not be as good .	St
1.4.4	I was thinking of getting either a Hauppauge USB 2.0 , or a Hauppauge PVR-250 TV Tuner .	St
1.4.5	What would be better ?	Ques
1.4.6	One last thing , for the Pinnacle card , there is 256 MB Video Memory listed , is this a typo ?	Ques
1.4.7	because i 've never seen video memory on a card of that category .	St
1.5.1	The salesperson did n't know too much about the ATI cards ... Are they in the same league as the ones in the previous post ?	Ques
1.5.2	ATI TV Wonder External USB 2.0 Tuner Card http : //www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? logon= & langid=EN & dept=0 & sku_id=0926INGFS10054208 & catid=20397 & newdeptid=20374 ATI TV Wonder PCI Card http : //www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp ? logon= & langid=EN & dept=0 & sku_id=0926INGFS10055031 & catid=20397 & newdeptid=20374	St
1.6.1	and again , I did n't like the Pinnacle software that came with it , but the card itself is awesome ... .great quality .	St
1.6.2	The Dazzle is still sitting on my desktop reading to plug in if I need it .	St
1.6.3	The one thing I liked about the Dazzle was when I was copying my VCR movies that had the macrovision encryption , it ripped it right out all by itself instead of my having to use the device I bought separately .	St
1.6.4	None of the internal cards ever could .	St
1.6.5	TONI	St
1.7.1	and was n't as impressed with it as I thought I would be .	St
1.7.2	It was easy to install , and use , but it was very proprietary about being the king of the hill in the system and I got more errors with that card installed ( and its software ) if I tried to go with using any other programs than anything else I 've tried .	St
1.7.3	The card is still here , but in my spare system instead .	St
1.7.4	TONI	St
1.8.1	I have used both ATI and Hauppauge TV cards .	St
1.8.2	Such run about 49 bucks and you get your analog capture without any fuss .	St
1.8.3	If you are going to go FIREWIRE , then the price plummets to under 20 bucks for Firewire card , cable and some software .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Most cards I see are 100dollars and up .	St
1.9.2	And as for digital/analog , I need both of them ...	St
1.9.3	THe thing I liked about the Pinnacle card was that it had both inputs , but then again - I already have a couple of firewire cards .	St
