<s> I read on another board something about the Intel MacBook Pro having wireless N capability. </s>
<s> I curently run a wireless g router. </s>
<s> Does anyone know anything about making the MacBook Pro n-compatible? </s>
<s> II did a quick bit of research at the Apple store and it woud seem tht only the Macbook Pro has a wireless card that is capable of &quot;N&quot;, via a Firmware update. </s>
<s> You might want to call Apple to confirm/deny that. </s>
<s> I could not find anywhere that specifically stated that the MacBook could not be updated. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> It would be a monumental blunder to make a N only card. </s>
<s> ALL such cards have B and G capability or else no Mac could use free wifi hotspots. </s>
<s> Think about it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> a suggestion anywhere in this thread. </s>
<s> The MacBook Pro has the capability, not turned on when shipped, of using the N protocol. </s>
<s> I believe the Airport Extreme base station and the newer iMacs also have the capability to use N but need the firmware update to turn it on. </s>

<s> Ooops. </s>
<s> Someone had just asked me about using the MBP's N card on their G router. </s>
