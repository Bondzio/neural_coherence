note that its recommended system is a dual core cpu, 2gb of ram, and geforce 7900gt/8600gts or better graphics card.
anything less and you're going to have to reduce your resolution or start turning off most of the visual effects.
even dual 7600gs cards don't approach the performance of a 7900gt so you should consider a geforce 8600gts (or try to find a 7950gt or radeon x1950xt).
evga 8600gts, $160 before $150 rebate:  cpu-wise, your options are limited because of your 939 socket motherboard (socket 939 was obsoleted by socket am2 more than a year ago).
athlon x2s go all the way up to 3.4ghz (x2 6400+) but require the am2 socket.
but in the 939 flavor, you're limited to 2.2ghz (x2 4200+ is $70).
x2's are overclock friendly so you should be able to crank an x2 4200+ up to 2.6-2.8ghz fairly easily.
