also you could look at an SFF box, but those will cost more another option would be to wait for AMD's planned PC, which is designed for just what your looking for, but i'd like to note that it's going to be VERY SLOW (and projected MSRP is like $249) that Dell wouldn't be a bad deal for a second PC another thing i'd like to say, it might not entirely &quot;blow away&quot; a $1000 PC from 2 years ago my PC is almost that old, and cost about that much 2 years ago, and I gurantee that even before upgrades, it could eat that Dell alive and i'm pretty sure my HP from 2k1 could too (if it was still together, i parted out some of it and just have the CPU and hard disk now, and it's a lot more powerful (as I added a GeForce FX 5900 to replace it's GeForce 2MX)
