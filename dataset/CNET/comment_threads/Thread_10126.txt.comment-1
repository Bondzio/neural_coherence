I'm trying to connect my new Dell Dimension 8400 (3.0Ghz/512Mb/XPsp1) to my home wireless network.
I installed two diiferent PCI adapter cards in my one available PCI slot -- an older D-Link (11b) and a brand new Netgear (11g) (which Dell Sales assured me is compatible).
Both cards detected my Netgear wireless router and provided an excellent internet connection, so I'm assuming they were seated properly.
The problem is that every time I shut down the system I get the blue screen of death with the following message: Hardware Malfunction NMI: Parity Check/Memory Parity Error The System has halted The system runs and shuts down perfectly when the PCI cards are removed.
D-Link and Netgear Support technicians told me I have to contact Dell, but Dell Support doesn't seem to have an answer for me.
Has anyone else had this problem, or better yet a solution?
Anyone know which wireless PCI adapter cards are truly compatible with Dell hardware?
Thanks!
