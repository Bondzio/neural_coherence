I bought a power supply which is 430W and installed into my PC which still works fine. I just found out that my old (original) power supply was 250W. Will this increase in wattage be something bad for my PC or good? I haven't upgraded anything else. My old power supply fan was facing to the vent on the Desk top tower but the new one which I installed, is facing inside the PC and not to the vent. Is it something that I should be concerned about? Your expert advice is much appreciated

A wall outlet here can deliver about 15 Amperes at 110 Volts or about 1600 Watts. It does not blow out a 10 Watt LED lamp because the lamp draws what it needs. 2. Fan. There is no carved in stone mandate that the fan be in a particular place on the PSU. Since you upsized the PSU and it's working I'd say it's fine. Bob

I can't offer why in recent yrs. that placement of the fan is now changed but overall I haven't seen it being a negative result. Airflow in a PC case still has to followed, in that the frt. of PC case is &quot;IN&quot; and the rear of PC is &quot;OUT&quot; flow. For your benefit, place a thin strip of cloth or paper that flows and locate near rear of PC case by fan. Is it blowing away from PC, then it's OK. If not and is thrown in, then suspect that the airflow is there to circulate inside and then be thrown out by yet another fan. As long as there is airflow &quot;in &lt;-&gt; out&quot; then allow it to do its job. tada -----Willy

I think now I am a mini PSU expert I have mounted the power supply correctly as there is only one possible position where it can mounted. On the tower PC, the vent is in the rear near below power plug-in, but the power supply fan is on the side. I did place a piece of paper on the rear of the vent and it blows it away. So it shows air movement and I am all satisfied that my mobo won't be fried
