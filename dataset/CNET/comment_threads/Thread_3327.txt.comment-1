I printed out my .tif file in photoshop onto a sheet paper and the result was amazing.
Colors were accurate to what was on screen.
However, when I loaded the .tif file in the program Epson Print CD and printed to DVD, the colors seem faded and even appeared like some colors were not used or mixed.
Either the Epson program is not very good or the paper quality of the printable DVD does not absorb the ink well?
Anyone having the same problem or have suggestions?
