i came home from a business trip yesterday and my laptop (ibm thinkpad w/windows xp)won't connect to the internet.
i have a wireless network set up (d-link), with a hard-connected pc and my son's gateway laptop.
everything was working fine when i left, and my laptop worked fine at the hotels and airport yesterday.
now it won't connect, although the pc and my son's laptop are having no problems.
i paid for the airport wireless connection yesterday - could that have reset or screwed something up in my settings?
i've tried everything i can think of and am at my wit's end.
on the task bar, it says i have an excellent connection, but when i open the wireless networks, it says &quot;not connected&quot;.
i've tried the windows &quot;repair&quot; button, but it says it can't connect.
any suggestions greatly appreciated!!!
