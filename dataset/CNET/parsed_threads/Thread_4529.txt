<s> My wife's computer's hard drive died. </s>
<s> I tried installing both IDE and SATA drives to use for the restore. </s>
<s> None of them are recognized by the Disk Management system on the Restore CD. </s>
<s> The BIOS shows the HDD. </s>
<s> I partitioned and formatted the new SATA HDD on my computer and reinstalled it on the wife's computer. </s>
<s> I have changed all of the HHD settings shown in the BIOS i.e. </s>
<s> ACHI/IDE and Native/Legacy. </s>
<s> The motherboard is Intel; I think it is DG33FB, but I cannot find the model number. </s>
<s> The defective HHD was a 320 GB Seagate. </s>
<s> The new HDD is a Western Digital 500 GB. </s>
<s> The CD that came with the WD is supposed to be bootable, but it will not boot. </s>
<s> I tried asking Microsoft, but they claim it is a hardware problem. </s>
<s> I am at a loss as what to do. </s>
<s> Help, please!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> CD/DVD drives loose boot capability but work fine in windows so no surprise to me (just those that encounter it the first and about the first ten times.) </s>
<s> Microsoft is right to not support this but it is annoying. </s>
<s> Let's not ask them to support booting a WD CD. </s>
<s> -&gt; Try disabling AHCI mode. </s>
<s> Without a driver diskette (the famous F6 FLOPPY you find at google) XP has no clue what SATA is. </s>

<s> SATA wasn't offered when XP came out. </s>
<s> Thus you need the driver provided by the HD maker. </s>
<s> Visit the WD support website and get it or check your WD CD and see if its there. </s>
<s> If so, expand it and make a bootable floppy(usually) or access by another bootable means. </s>
<s> Thus, when you use your restore CD when it asks, &quot;outside drivers needed/required&quot; or similar wording during the XP install. </s>
<s> A restore CD should offer small menu to supply whatever to continue the install process. </s>
<s> FYI, the making of XP install on another system just won't work when swapped to the end system. </s>
<s> On top of the SATA issue you will have a XP blank screen or blinking cursor as a result. </s>
<s> Review the bios setting so SATA is active and/or both SATA+ EIDE if you plan to use EIDE too. </s>
<s> You will need also to make the boot order, if SATA is going to be the primary boot device, enable it. </s>
<s> You may need to play with it for best results as it varies from bios to bios and mtrbds. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> WD will not supply a driver for your computer or the drive. </s>
<s> SATA is part of the motherboard and the driver is from that maker. </s>
