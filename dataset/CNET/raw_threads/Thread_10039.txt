If you plan to replace the int. drive it must be a match or actually fits and uses the same i/f as the old drive. So, be 100% sure it will work with your laptop model#. The quick and easy method is just buy an ext. drive that plugs into a USB port or eSATA if so equipped for ease of use. That's it, just use as any other drive. I do suggest you buy the &quot;kit&quot; form so everything is all present for use. tada -[-----Willy

The reason I asked was I seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in. I was looking at this drive: http://www.advancetec.co.uk/pioneer-bdr-td03rt-internal-slim-6x-bdrw-bluray-writer-for-laptop-small-form-factor.html it seems cheap enough and does what I want

(this is true today and if anyone finds such, please share it. No, trials do not count!) This is why a bare drive may not do what you want. I've lost count of folk that get the drive then discover they need software. The sad part is if they had got the software with the drive, it would have been cheaper. Bob
