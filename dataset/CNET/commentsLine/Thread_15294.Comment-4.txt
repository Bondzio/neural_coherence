a few thoughts on it.
1. beware the caps.
if you exceed you byte limits, it's very expensive.
2. they do not discount the plan on this.
my droid costs me less per month than the wifi mobile hotspot without a cap (for now.)
3. there were some that made claims the units overheat but mine ran 24x7 and was fine for the weeks we used it.
