edit; i tried it again and the psu fan does spin, but not cpu, or any other fan, however if i have a 3 fan speed knob on the case fans, and when i move it to highest speed or something the fan begins to spin....and will stay spinning, also led on these fan still are flashing...also before this problem when i presseed power all the fans go full speed for a few seconds then stop for 1 second or so and then start up normally.
now they go full speed and then just stop, or twitch
