Good question.
Just that it is the latest thing and I'd like to try it.
I like the adaptability of having the lightness of a tablet when i browse the internet in a coffee shop, or watch a movie on the train, then the ability to connect it to a keyboard at my desk when i need to write a big word file.
I may either settle on another small laptop, or hold out for the Windows 8 tablets coming out within 2 months, eg the Samsung Ativ Smart PC (which is a large monster, am assuming there will be smaller Win8 Tablet offers)
