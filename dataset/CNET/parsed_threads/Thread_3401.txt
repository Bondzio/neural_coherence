<s> I have a gateway2000 and I need the bootup disk. </s>
<s> Do anyone know where I can find one? </s>
<s> http://www.bootdisk.com will serve up what you need....choose the right disk for the version windows you have installed. </s>
<s> Then put a clean floppy disk in the drive, click the .exe file you downloaded and it will create the bootdisk for you in about ten minutes. </s>
