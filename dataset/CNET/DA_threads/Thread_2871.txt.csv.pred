1.1.1	Hello, I've been looking at a Western Digital - My Passport Essential 500GB External USB 3.0/2.0 Portable Hard Drive.	St
1.1.2	What is the speed of this drive (5,400 or 7,400 RPM) and does it make a big difference?	St
1.1.3	I have looked everywhere for this spec.	St
1.1.4	My primary purpose is save my finished audio and video projects to an external drive.	St
1.1.5	Would this be a well recommended drive, since I would like to have two, to be on the safer side?	St
1.1.6	Thanks, Eric	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Will it make a difference?	St
1.3.2	I would say yes but I don't think it's that much faster that you could notice.	St
1.3.3	Your computer already have usb3 support?	St
1.3.4	Although it is backward compatible to usb2.	St
