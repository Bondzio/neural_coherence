<s> My tablet has crashed and died. </s>
<s> Unable to boot. </s>
<s> Black screen, will not power on. </s>
<s> Also, now unable to erase personal financial data and files... backup files accessible wherever I had the tablet. </s>
<s> Tablet crashed within warranty after 9 months. </s>
<s> Acer did ask me to send to a Texas repair facility, except will not assure me personal data will not be accessed by repair people. </s>
<s> Advised me to take to local technician! </s>
<s> Then what? </s>
<s> The thing does not work! </s>
<s> Anyone out there have any answers to my quandry, any advice? </s>
<s> Think twice when looking at Acer. </s>
<s> We know from experience and the CNET moderators that &quot;we only lose what we don't backup.&quot; As to the information on this dead tablet, if it's worth that much then you take the tablet to the grinder and get a new device/thing. </s>
<s> If it's worth fixing, let Acer fix it. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob PS. </s>
<s> There is no assurance any thing/device will work without error. </s>
<s> Is this something new for you? </s>
<s> At 86 years old,I know a lot about how things go bad...not happy when they do within 8-9 months of purchase making my sensitive &quot;stuff&quot; available to eyes of strangers if sent for repair. </s>
<s> Have other backups of the stuff, so that's not the problema. </s>
<s> Wanted to erase ere' sending to Texas... sytem crash prevented... can't know if personal data vulnerable. </s>
<s> &quot;Device&quot; has disappointed, but when it worked, it was good; Acer support service questionable. </s>
<s> Know I can &quot;shred&quot; the &quot;thing&quot; any time, but being a Great Depression boy, try my best to salvage a bad situation and cost. </s>
<s> Even at 86, will keep tilting at windmills a while longer . </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Most data recovery houses deal with this question daily. </s>
<s> It's as I put forward above. </s>
<s> You trust them or you don't. </s>
<s> If you don't trust them then you shred it and move on. </s>
<s> It looks like this is a hard decision for all of us today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Mr. Proffitt: Maybe I'm not understanding your reference to data recovery houses. </s>
<s> Not sure you understood earlier problem description. </s>
<s> Data recovery is not what I'm concerned about. </s>
<s> Security of personal financial data is my concern. </s>
<s> If I'd guessed the Tablet would die as quickly as it did, of course I would have erased it....would not have put it on to begin with. </s>
<s> Hindsight is.............. . </s>
<s> Acer support classified the precursor signs and final premature death of my Acer Iconia A500, a &quot;hardware problem,&quot; and without further ado, asked me to ship it to Texas repair solution.... at my cost incidentally...even within the warranty period. </s>
<s> Great Depression days remember! </s>
<s> Yep Mr. Proffitt... life is full of them (hard decisions I mean)... And, I don't trust them, human frailties being what they are. </s>
<s> Understand them..I think. </s>
<s> Financial data too fruitful to ignore...even when Acer support tells me data not accessible to repair technicians. </s>
<s> I'm not an expert by any means.. especially with tablet hardware....but give me a break! </s>
<s> Thanks again for replying. </s>
<s> They get the same question about security. </s>
<s> You can read their stance at www.drivesavers.com But I think you see the issue clearly as in, if you don't trust them, then it's to the grinder. </s>
<s> If you want to get the device fixed, you will have to trust them. </s>
<s> --&gt; Bottom line is it is all about trust. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Your link rcovery link most interesting. </s>
<s> Will investigate. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
