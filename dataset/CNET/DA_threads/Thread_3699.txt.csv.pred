1.1.1	Hello, I read the cnet.com review on this hard drive and it seems a good choice for my daughter to take to college.	St
1.1.2	She'll be using an Apple MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard, but will sometimes be on a Windows platform while at the library.	St
1.1.3	My question is related to the optional cables that can be purchased and which are required.	St
1.1.4	Their adverts say 'can be upgraded to Firewire 800', well I have a Firewire 800 cable that's compatible with her MacBook; so can it be plugged to the Seagate from her MacBook and that's all I would need?	St
1.1.5	Thanks much.	St
1.2.1	The speed gain is there on the Apple but here's the big deal.	St
1.2.2	Windows still has proven to be less than happy with firewire connected drives.	St
1.2.3	I won't vet all my answers but here's what I would use.	St
1.2.4	1.	St
1.2.5	Said drive.	St
1.2.6	2.	St
1.2.7	USB 2.0 3.	St
1.2.8	NTFS for the file system since the new Apple OSX can read and write to that.	St
1.2.9	Be sure that they know to not &quot;store&quot; things there.	St
1.2.10	It's not &quot;storage.&quot; If there is any doubt about that, read all the posts in this forum.	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	I've got some more reading to do on all this and you've given me a good start - Thanks	St
