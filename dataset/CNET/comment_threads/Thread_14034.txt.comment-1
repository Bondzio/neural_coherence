I recently upgraded the motherboard and processor to my rapidly aging eMachines desktop.
The hardware store I normally buy from was running a deal.
Now I have a Chaintech MPM800-3 with a 2.80 GHz Celeron processor running with my factory standard hard drive, CD-RW and power supply.
Things have been running extremely well, except for a recent occurance of random freezes and shut downs.
Sometimes whatever I'm doing will hang for a second and then the screen will go black and come back up normal in 1-2 seconds.
Other times everything will lock up requiring a forced reboot.
Still other times the computer will simply shut down, no error message, nothing.
I was thinking that it could be my dinky 250 Watt power supply or possibly a heat issue.
If anyone has any suggestions I would be very grateful.
