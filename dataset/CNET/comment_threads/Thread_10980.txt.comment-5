I had the same error on my Dell Optiplex 240, 1.5mhz, 256MB, 80gig, win2000 pro system, when I tried to install the pinnacle studio av/dv card on my system.
I talked with dell support as well as pinnacle support, basically had already tried what they told me to try, different PCI slots and taking all cards out that I could except that one and configuration setup to no avail.
Ended up taking it back to Best Buy for a refund!
So much for those tech support people reading it from a manual.
They were no help.
I'am finding out that here on Cnet and myself are the best tech support.
