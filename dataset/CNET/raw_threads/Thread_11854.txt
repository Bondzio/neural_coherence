It'll restore the router to factory configuration and the username to &quot;admin&quot; without the quotes. Proceed from there. If you have some custom settings you'll have to redo them.

What happens when you hook up your computer to one of the NIC ports (RJ45) using a CAT 5/6 cable?? Do you have all your systems named to the same workgroup? Make sure each computer has a unique IP address (this is usually done automatically but....). Let us know. and life goes on... Jack
