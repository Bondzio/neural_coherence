I just returned to the &lt; http://www.learntcpip.com/ &gt; site to see if I could get a lesson running.
I did.
I downloaded the &quot;History of the Internet&quot; topic and, within a few minutes, it was playing both the video and audio.
The lessons are just about at the right level for this learner - abject beginner &lt;grin&gt;.
Thanks.
I'll keep trying to view the rest.
Any more tips about other network (and even general computer)learning sites like this one?
Goood materials &lt;g&gt;.
