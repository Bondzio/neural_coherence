I think the logic is that with Artic Silver 5, they don't want you to &quot;pre-spread&quot; the stuff at all.
This seemed surprising to me at the time.
It's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you.
I e-mailed Artic Silver and they said that using this method eliminates &quot;air gaps&quot;... and that if you &quot;pre-spread&quot; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps.
Off I go!
