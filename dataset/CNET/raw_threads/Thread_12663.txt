Now with the new router, router #2 does not allow connectivity to the internet. I am looking for the proper device to connect to one of the router ports. Thanks,

I don't need that since I'm on cable. SO adjust as you see fit. But I did have to make sure the LAN on router one was not the same IP range as router two. I used 192.168.1.x for router 1 and 192.168.2.x for ... Besides that, it's just the default settings. &quot;I am looking for the proper device to connect to one of the router ports&quot; That would be a wifi router or WAP. Today, the wifi router is the cheap solution. Bob
