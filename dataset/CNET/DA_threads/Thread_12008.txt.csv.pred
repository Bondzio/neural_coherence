1.1.1	I need help.Just purchased a new Netgear wireless router which came with no cd and I am unable to download the firmware.The message that I get is that fragments were downloaded and it may hurt by system.Purchased from Amazon and there was no indication that this would not be provided, Just purchased a dell laptop.My OS is windows xp and I have comcast internet service.	St
1.1.2	I am in desperate need of help.I tried for hours with no success.	St
1.1.3	Can someone let me know where I can go in order to download the firmware.	St
1.1.4	I understand that all settings should be automatic but I do know that I need the firmware since there was no dics provided.I was able to get the instruction manual but without the firmware, I cannot do anything.	St
1.1.5	Netgear was not helpful to me because this was a refurbished item.	St
1.1.6	None of this was relayed to me during my purchase.	St
1.1.7	Please someone help me, I am so frustrated after trying for hours!	St
1.1.8	Thank you for you help in advance, decorator31	St
1.2.1	Netgear manual can be found here http://kbserver.netgear.com/pdf/wgr614v6_ref_man_20Apr05.pdf Rick	St
1.3.1	Firmware installs to memory in the router, not your computer.	St
1.3.2	The router already has a version installed, and you don't need to download and install anything if it already has the latest version.	St
1.3.3	All the routers I have seen NEVER come with a firmware disc because a firmware version is already installed in the router AT THE FACTORY.	St
1.3.4	If the router doesn't have the latest firmware version (you need to read the manual to discover how to check this), then download it using a computer and Internet connection that works properly.	St
1.3.5	IMPORTANT: After you download the latest version, follow the instructions on the webpage or in the manual to install the firmware update.	St
1.3.6	If you don't read and follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are written, then you risk turning your router into an expensive doorstop.	St
1.3.7	Please read the instructions.	Sug
1.3.8	* * * * * I had absolutely no trouble downloading the latest version today.	St
1.3.9	Version &quot;2.0.13_1.0.13&quot; for North America Version &quot;2.0.14_1.0.14&quot; for Worldwide - outside North America Download the one that is appropriate for where you live.	St
1.3.10	Get firmware here (Left side of your screen): http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/wgr614v6.asp	St
1.4.1	Thanks for your response.When I go to the netgear website and try to download it the message that I get says &quot;recovered file fragment&quot;.I am not very good when it comes to this.I can follow directions but am so confused.	St
1.4.2	Can you give me step by step directions in order to do this.The Amazon store is not getting back to me.	St
1.4.3	I need this new laptop because I am bed-ridden and can not use my desktop computer as often as I need to.	St
1.4.4	I am so sorry and would appreciate any help that I could get.I have already been to the links that you provided me.	St
1.4.5	That's when I get the message about the recovered file fragments.	St
1.4.6	I have a surfboard modem from comcast and a Linksys router because I have Tivo connected thru my internet.	St
1.4.7	I do know that I need to only use the Netgear router and forget about the Linksys router.	St
1.4.8	Please help me as I am so frustrated.	St
1.4.9	I am normally very good at figuring out electronic solutions but am having a big problem here.	St
1.4.10	Thank you, decorator31	St
1.5.1	It's something they have to learn about it seems.	St

1.6.1	I just happen to have the original Netgear WGR614 v6 CD.	St

1.6.3	Also, I have a very similar configuration: Motorola Surfboard cable modem, Linksys Router (Vonage phone line), plus I have a wireless print server.	St
1.6.4	I'm currently reloading my system with updated drivers.	St
1.6.5	Let me know if you want me to image the CD for you.	St
