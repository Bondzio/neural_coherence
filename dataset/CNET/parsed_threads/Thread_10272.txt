<s> I have an Abit AA8XE mainboard which will supports up to 4Gig of Single/Dual channel DIMM modules, delivering bandwidth of 8.5GB/sec. </s>
<s> It originally used DDR2 400 but I have some newer DDR2 800(PC6400). </s>
<s> Will there be any compatibility issues? </s>
<s> compatibility depends on the actual dimms. </s>
<s> as long as they have spd timings for ddr2-533 and can function with 1.8V, you should be OK. ddr2-400 is a rare beast nowadays. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input, i got it working good with both speeds of RAM! </s>
<s> Now if i can get the second memory bank slots to accept my other 1GB sticks.......... </s>
