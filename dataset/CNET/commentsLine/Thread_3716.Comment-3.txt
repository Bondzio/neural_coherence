i purchased the samsung 710n-2 from zipzoomfly and received an older model &quot;samsung 710n&quot; (no -2)and the box came without any upc code for rebate.
i am currently in the middle of trying to rectify this situation with zipzoomfly/samsung.
beware of dealing with them as you may end up with something you did not want!
