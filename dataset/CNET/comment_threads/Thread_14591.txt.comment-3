I'm doing essentially the same search, though my needs will be less color-intensive.
The Brother 9840 has an astonishingly high percentage of happy users (18 out of 19 5-stars - at Amazon, I think.)
I did find one review at Government Computer News that suggested the layout of the physical plant leads to accidental popping open of the paper tray door, which would drive me crazy.
The same review gave top marks to the Okidata 5550, which has the advantage of having a straight paper path; however I can't find any user reviews on this unit.
Maybe somebody will give you some more input.
The one caveat I have run across for the Xerox units is that since they use solid ink, 1) it smells like melted crayons while they're running, and 2) if color prints get folded, the &quot;ink&quot; flakes off.
