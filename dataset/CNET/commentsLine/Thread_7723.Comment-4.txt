last friday i bought a pinnacle pctv hybrid tuner kit for windows vista ... the box says &quot;experience the full power of windows media center&quot;.
i have installed the pctv installer for windows media center version 3.1 from the included pinnacle cdrom and also checked for recent pinnacle drivers but this is the latest version available.
but windows mce does not recognize this usb stick at all !!!
however the pctv driver is available in vista device manager and a freeware tool (free for 30 days) can use the pctv usb stick for watching tv and also the a/v input works with my digital sony camera.
i am running everything on a brand new acer laptop amd turion 64 x2 mobile technology tl-60 with 2048 mb of ram and have all vista updates installed since yesterday.
because there is no tv application included i am really disappointed with this pinnacle package.
by the way it has the &quot;certified for windows vista&quot; logo on the box, what a shame !!!
so i need help with this very urgent because i can return the package to the shop and receive a refund within 8 days.
is there anybody who has already a working combination of a pinnacle pctv card/usb with windows media center in vista ?
thanks
