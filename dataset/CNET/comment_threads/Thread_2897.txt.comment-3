Thanks good suggestions, especially the graphics comparisons.
I already have Vista Business ready to go, except that M-Audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve, so it will have to be XP for a while longer.
64 bit even later.
I have a new case / PS and wireless KB/Mouse etc.
Core Duo makes sense as I'm already sold on multi-processors anyway.
