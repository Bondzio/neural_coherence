1.1.1	I have had a gateway desktop for about 9 mos now and I was wondering what I could upgrade the processor to it is a intel 915G Express chipset as of right now it has the pentium 4 550 3.4Ghz it is an LGA775 socket i think not positive .	St
1.1.2	not to goos with this sort of thing i buy it and then i have comp store install it because if i buy threw them i pay x2 lol	St
1.2.1	http : //www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm I see a few 3.8 GHz CPUs that may work but then again the gain is minimal .	St
1.2.2	What is driving this need ?	Ques
1.2.3	Games ?	Ques
1.2.4	If so a graphics card will pay off .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes this is for games a lot of the new games I am seeing require at lease 2.6ghz I have already got ram at 2 GB and Nvidia 7300 GS 256mb video .	St
1.3.2	just worried games are going to start lagging did n't know if my PC could hold a EMT64 Processor or a Pentium D lol i though since they were all the same socket type ( at lease that what i thought when i looked threw newegg ) that i could use any	St
1.4.1	Hardly any game stresses on a 3GHz P4 with HT .	St
1.4.2	You have better than that .	St
1.4.3	Look at the video card for gains here .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	ok my video Card has the option of going to 512mb I just do n't know if it drains it from my system or if in some way I add memory to the actual card ... ... odds are it drains from system since never heard of one that has a ram slot lol ... .. but my system says it can only handle 2 GB of ram it has 4 ram slots and I have 512MB 's in each slot did n't know if Gateway was just being conservative lol just did n't know if I should sacrifice the system ram for video ram	St
1.6.1	ohh BTW its a gateway 506GR	St
1.7.1	and low wattage PSU .	St
1.7.2	Your system has a built-in graphics CPU ( vice a graphics card ) and the memory to run it is borrowed from the system memory .	St
1.7.3	You 're OK re RAM but onboard video does n't cut it for games .	St
1.7.4	Adding a more powerful video card , one suitable for gaming , takes a more robust PSU .	St
1.7.5	You could look for a video card that does n't require more than a 300 WATT PSU but that will really limit your options .	St
1.7.6	Good Luck and keep us posted .	St
1.7.7	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	video card was changed 2-3 mos ago it has a Nvidia Geforce 7300GSis has 256Mb on board but that package for it says it can go up 512mb i am guessing it draaws system ram for its one use the onboard video has been disables and i currenly have the full 2048 installed	St
