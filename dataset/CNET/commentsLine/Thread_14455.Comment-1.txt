my 3 year old emach is dead.
when i turn it on hard drive access light stays on, power supply fan runs, small fan on heatsink does not, ( will turn freeley by hand.)
i liked my old emach,so i purchased a new one model t5010.
i do not want to donate or give my old one away as it has a lot of personal info on hard drive.
i can not transfer the info to my new one as it has a sticker on the cover that if broken voids the warranty.
should i take the hard drive,cd, and two 256 merory sticks out and throw the rest in the trash.
?
