all good suggestions.
there may be some that disagree, but when processing video, the graphics card does not play a large part in the process.
raw computing power is more important.
after the cutting and splicing, where you need to be able to see what you are doing, there is really no need for a monitor at all.
the rendering and converting to the required format for a dvd, which is where all the processing happens, does not even appear on the screen.
in idvd there is a progress bar and that's about it.
the blair witch project was produced entirely on a powerbook, pre intel, and powerbooks never did have top line graphics cards.
