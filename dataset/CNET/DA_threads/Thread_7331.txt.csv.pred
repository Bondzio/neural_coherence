1.1.1	I recently bought a USB3 portable Hdd .	St
1.1.2	case .	St
1.1.3	From my unscientific observation , it seem to me it is as fast as my eSATA Hdd ... it might even be slightly faster .	St
1.1.4	I transferred 3.8Gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes , and my eSATA takes about 4 minutes .	St
1.1.5	Oh the USB3 case is connected to the USB2 port of the computer only .	St
1.1.6	I did n't have a USB3 port to connect it to ( another story for later ) .	St
1.2.1	I transferred a 2.44 gig file from my main box to both a USB 2 and an eSATA external .	St
1.2.2	The eSATA transfer took about 21.5 seconds and the USB 2 was about a minute and a half .	St
1.2.3	Your 3.8 gig file is roughly 1/2 again as large as the one I used so my transfer of your file on my system would be roughly 33 seconds to the eSATA and 2 1/2 minutes to the USB2 .	St
1.3.1	then I have .	St
1.3.2	I was really looking to see if just the usb3 case alone would make a difference as I have experienced .	St
1.3.3	My usb2 transfer rate usually ran about 2 minute per GB .	St
1.3.4	It 's a turtle compare to what you have .	St
1.4.1	and not the USB .	St
1.4.2	Your USB connection seems to be more consistent with my USB 2 .	St
1.4.3	In a sense , that might answer your own question .	St
1.4.4	You are operating at USB 2 functionality but your eSATA is messed up .	St
1.4.5	It should be much faster .	St
1.4.6	I wonder if you do n't suffer from that Intel matrix storage manager issue .	St
