to me netbooks are kind of a hassle.
i mean i see the point in them.
but notebook computers are so cheap nowadays.
i mean you can get a decent full running pc notebook pretty cheap.
for just a little bit more or even the same price as these netbooks you can get a budget notebook that will actually be faster and have a lot more hard drive space with cd drive.
theres also a lot of 14.1 inch screens out now that have really powerful processors and lots of ram.
so, if you wanted small that would work also.
but i still do see the need in a netbook for some people.
although i'd much rather have my standard 15 inch screen notebook.
i have 4 gigs of ram, 320 gig hard drive, core 2 duo processor, hdmi port, dvd rw... and it definitely feels portable enough for me.
stick it in a back pack and go!
