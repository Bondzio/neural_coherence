I do not see any hard drive activity on the machine. With this new DVD RW cofiguratoin I may have screwed up something. Please help how do I diagnose the error. Thanks in advance. Mak

If it boots normally, then start by checking the IDE cables, see if the IDE cable you were using is in perfect shape, and replace accordingly. Check for loose power cables, because they can give you many hard times. Although it might sound obvious, check if any of the power cables is stopping a Cooling Fan (has happened before) And last but not least, check the rating for your PSU, if it hasn't got enough juice, it will not be able to crank the computer with the new hardware added. If it still gives you the same headache, you're in trouble, for you might have fried the HDD.
