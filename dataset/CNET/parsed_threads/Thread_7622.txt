<s> My Linksys WRT54GC (version2) model router frequently stops wireless broadcasting and I have to unplug and replug the power cable to connect again. </s>
<s> After some time, it again suddenly stops wireless broadcast until it's repowered. </s>
<s> I've been having this problem for over 2 weeks now and tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times but couldn't solve the problem. </s>
<s> Anyone, has experience in this issue, has any reccomendation ? </s>
<s> Sounds like the transmitter is failing. </s>
<s> Warranty? </s>
<s> Use it. </s>
<s> I'm afraid warranty period is expired =( is there any other reccomendation ? </s>
<s> Update the firmware and keep the settings SIMPLE. </s>
<s> No mac filters, use WPA and don't hide that SSID. </s>
<s> And let the air get to all six sides. </s>

<s> My answers are mostly repeats. </s>
