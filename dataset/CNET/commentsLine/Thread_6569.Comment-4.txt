ok so i disabled dchp on my netgear and now that i did, i can't login to my router... now that the ip isn't automatically assigned, i get an &quot;automatic private address&quot; issued... how do i log back in?
oh, plus, will i connect my wired ethernet pcs into the wireless (netgear), or the wired (actiontec), the one that recieves the internet through the phone line?
you guys have been great so far...
