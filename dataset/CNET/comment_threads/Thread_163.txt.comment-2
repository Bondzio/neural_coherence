for curtain #2.
I think you have somewhat a known entity for support with Compaq whereas you may or may not with a no-name PC.
I think the NEC is a great monitor.
You should be able to find a decent pair of speakers for $10.00 US.
The balance of the money can go towards any future software and/or peripherals you need.
Good luck.
