I purchased a Western Digital eSata external drive and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro using a SIIG eSata-to-Express34 Controller.
I formatted the drive using Disk Utility.
I find that I can read from the drive fine.
But whenever I try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while.
The drive has a USB interface as well, and I can read/write from the drive just fine using the USB.
But writes fail whenever I use the e-Sata interface.
What can be the problem?
