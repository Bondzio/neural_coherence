Hi, I did the same thing as you.
I bought an external hard disc and I'd like to have everything I have on my laptop on the extra disc in case this computer goes belly-up.
What did you find worked for you?
Do you have to partition drives?
Is there a reason people partition drives?
I'd appreciate your advice since you just went through it.
I guess it's technically a backup in the cmoputer world, but it's a fall-back position for me.
Thanks!
Mary
