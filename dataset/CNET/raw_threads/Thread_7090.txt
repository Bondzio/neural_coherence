9705	0	120543	1367290	NR	megan123	8/17/05 8:42 PM	1.12431132E12	New Hard Drive	I have an old desktop computer(300Mhz PII Processor w/512K Cache, 128 MB SDRAM, 4MB 3-D AGP Graphics and there was a 5 GB 9ms Ultra ATA Hard Drive) and the hard drive crashed. I also have a laptop but would like to use my old desktop in a home network. What type and specifications for a internal hard drive would work with my computer?

Try to find out from the vendor if there is a size limit on hard driev that the PC will recognize. 40 GB is about the smallest you can find these days, but if you need a smaller one, they may be available; just Foogle to find out.

The OS will be an indicator of how large a HD you can use without 3rd party software. (I know I have some OLD HDs collecting dust around here somewhere ) and life goes on... Jack

Their setup software will basically 'clone' your current system drive. Make sure it's installed as the slave drive first. Then 'clone' the system drive to it. Then replace the old drive with the new one. Reboot (making sure it grabs the new one) and you will have a new system drive. Let us know how it turns out. and life goes on... Jack
