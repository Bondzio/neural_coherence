when a usb storage device is present it is seen as yet another &quot;storage&quot; area or drive.
while you can unplug/plug on the fly its best to use the &quot;unmounting&quot; icon or feature of that product to handle that.
yeah, the ext.
drive can be left unplugged before powering up system.
in effect it's simple to use but don't let that fool ya, treat it like any hd as if internal, handle with care.
now buy whatever ext.
hd you like but please check whatever features seems to fit your likening.
good luck -----willy
