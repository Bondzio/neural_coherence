ok my video Card has the option of going to 512mb I just don't know if it drains it from my system or if in some way I add memory to the actual card ...... odds are it drains from system since never heard of one that has a ram slot lol..... but my system says it can only handle 2 GB of ram it has 4 ram slots and I have 512MB's in each slot didn't know if Gateway was just being conservative lol just didn't know if I should sacrifice the system ram for video ram
