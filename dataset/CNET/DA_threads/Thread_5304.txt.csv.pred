1.1.1	I 'm considering purchasing one of these two computers and I 'm looking for feedback compairing the models and brands .	St
1.1.2	Is a Sony or a Gateway a safer buy ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Well , I would think the Sony RB 38G would be the better buy as it has a more powerful processor 3.4GHz as compared to the Gateway 820GM at 3.0GHZ .	St
1.2.2	Safer ?	Ques
1.2.3	Well , that depends on who has the floor at the time ... up for grabs .	St
1.2.4	http : //support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/4055/4055nv.shtml http : //www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start ? ProductSKU=VGCRB38G & CategoryName=cpu_RBSeriesdesktops & DCMP=CNET_DF & HQS=DT_VGCRB38G # specs	St
1.3.1	I just purchased the Gateway 820GM and I and so happy I did .	St
1.3.2	I have been looking at the Sony , HP , and the Gateway and did a lot of research before buying .	St
1.3.3	The Sony from what I tried was harder to use for the media center , more expensive than the others and did n't offer but .4 more speed , and I think most of us are not 100 % able to tell the difference between 3.0 and 3.4 mhz .	St
1.3.4	The HP almost sold me because they offer many more hook-ups in the front of the tower for many different items , that make it much easier for those who will be plugging in many things for editing and transfering , but for my business and personal use it is great .	St
1.3.5	I purchased the whole package together with the flat screen , and I am more than happy .	St
1.3.6	The PC is lighting fast w/ 1 gig memory , and the graphics and sound are top notch .	St
1.3.7	From all the research I did and the price of the 3 different PC 's , I think the Gateway for me was the best way , getting the most for my $ $ $ and the overall cost of the package .	St
1.3.8	The set-up is super easy and I did n't have any problems what so ever , I even hooked up a wireless router toconnect to the other PC and that was the most simple process and I have internet on both PC in a matter on minutes .	St
1.3.9	This is a great investment .	Polite
1.3.10	This is my 1st Gateway , and so far I would buy another , and recommend to all to buy this PC .	St
1.3.11	YOu will be very very happy .	St
