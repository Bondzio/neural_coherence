<s> I'm building a PC pretty soon. </s>
<s> I want to overclock my CPU not a lot. </s>
<s> Maybe 200 or 300 mhz. </s>
<s> I'm going to get an AMD 3500+ on Socket AM2. </s>
<s> My question is will any after market fan/heatsink work with any processor? </s>
<s> In particular, will http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835128007 this cooler work on http://www.newegg.com/product/Product.asp?item=N82E16813138026 this motherboard with an AM2 3500+? </s>
<s> What I would do is goto the manufacturers websites, I have no idea what AM2 socket is lol. </s>
<s> I dont think gigabyte make that heatsink any more. </s>
<s> Goto this link http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Cooler/Default.aspx . </s>
<s> If you want something to cool your CPU down. </s>
<s> Try asaka aswell. </s>
<s> But goto the Manufacturers site first! </s>
<s> and also do some more research on AM2! </s>
<s> A good place to start would be with AMD...... </s>
<s> MOst cpu/HSF setups are rated for thier highest level of usage. </s>
<s> So, if you get a fan for XYZ-1000cpu and it becomes overclocked to XYZ-1300cpu then you're really going beyond the rating of the fan. </s>
<s> Though a fan can take excessive heat, don't expect all fans to do so and whatever &quot;quality&quot; means alot. </s>
<s> Thus, some namebrnads fans are capable of handling OC'ing but look for any rating label to match what you plan to OC to as a safe bet of sustained usage. </s>
<s> Remember you still have to &quot;exhaust&quot; the immediate heat build-up as well to best serve any HSF to maintain its sustained rating or over time will fail. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
