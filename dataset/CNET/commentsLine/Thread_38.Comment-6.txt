it took 8 hrs.
after installing the card to get any keyboard functionality back.
then another 5 hrs.
the following day to get the vid card to not lock up.
after alot of googling, i found a bunch of hits that said *not* to install drivers above 60.85...but i didn't have that and had to go to the chaintech site in taiwan to d/l that for my particular card- which took over 12 hrs.
i didn't have the nvidia drivers cuz the disk cracked when i took it out of the case.
i sent an email to chaintech about which drivers i should get, and they said to go to the nvidia site and d/l the same drivers (ver.
61.77) that locked everything up on me.
duh!
well, everything looks good now, far cry looks absolutely fantastic compared to what i had with the ti4200 (still a good card, imo.)
i probably would have gotten a card a notch or 2 better, but this was the best card i could buy locally.
oh, well- guess i'll do that on my next system, which could be before the end of the year.
i want to see how the amd socket 939 boards do, and may go the amd 64 bit route.
strange that my ti4200 card accepted the 61.77 drivers, while i got the &quot;unsigned driver&quot; message on the new card.
