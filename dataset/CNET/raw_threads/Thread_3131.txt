I described to at least 4 different tech support people my problem none told me about the extention repair problem. Finally during christmas break i on a wiff typed in freezing emacs and came to a bunch of disscussion boards about the problem. I called Apple and the tech guy acted like he did not know what I was talking bout I had to guide him through to the web page. Finally he put on his supervisor and the guy got smart with me. He told me when i asked him for a case number to take to the Apple Service Providers that I dont need one because it is public knowledge, I was like that is funny I just talked to a apple tech and he did not know what it was. Anypoint, that is great that they are going to fix the project but dont be shady and what sucks the worse I have to wait at least 3 weeks before i get my computer back. If Apple thinks I am going to buy a Iphone they are crazy

This number establishes your problem, records it with the company, and if the problem drags on and on, you have proof of when the problem first started. Insist on a case number. Glad they decided to fix it for you P
