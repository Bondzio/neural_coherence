hi all, i'm having a particularly annoying problem with my pc at home.
at seemingly random intervals, the power will just die.
then it won't come back on.
i have to unplug the power cord from the outlet end and then plug it back in before the pc will turn on again.
any ideas on what would cause such a bizarre problem?
the sudden power loss isn't as baffling as the fact that i have to unplug and plug it back in again.
could a flaky power cord be the culprit?
(it's never that simple, i know...)
