glad everything worked out for you.
no, i'm afraid that maya just left me cold when i tried the demo and decided that photoshop elements with, perhaps, a little of the regular photoshop thrown in, was about my level of artistic expertise.
in your case, i hammered google looking for system specs for both those programs, but thanks for the compliment.
enjoy your new toys, p
