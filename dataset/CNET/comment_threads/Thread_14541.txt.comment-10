In RF applications not only the equipment matters but the environment and location of the RF equipment.
I know to relocate the wifi router, but others will blame the equipment.
I like the rangemax, but don't see them too often.
The lesser units work for most but then again I give the industry a failing grade on firmware and drivers.
