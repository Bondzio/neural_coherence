hi there i want to wirelessly connect 2 routers together to connect parts in my house (large house) where the wifi signal is weak from the main wifi device and i need some help on how to set this up.
router #1 is the new apple airport extreme (2013) plugged into an adsl modem in the lounge.
router #2 is a netgear r6300 and is in the downstairs bedroom.
how can i connect these 2 wirelessly to make the downstairs bedroom and other rooms downstairs have a strong connection.
i don't want to run a wired connection due to logistics.
both routers are 802ac so i presume the 2 routers will have a strong connection between them with 802ac and the beam technology built in.
but i need to know how to set up each router to make this possible?
and also do i connect to router #2 (netgear) with a lan cable into my downstairs computer or will that be able to distribute a wireless signal to seperate devices downstairs ie computer/ipad/iphone??
ideally i would like to connect my imac via a cable but also be able to use my iphone and ipad downstairs aswell off of the netgear router via wireless if this is possible?
i have been reading a few forums and believe you can bridge routers or set them up as access points but i need some help on the specifics on my set up please!
any advice will be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
