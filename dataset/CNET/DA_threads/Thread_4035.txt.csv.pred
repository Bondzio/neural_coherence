1.1.1	I have a Pressario SR5410F and it will only start evry 20 or 30 times I press the start button.	St
1.1.2	When it does not start I do not get a post beep, or get into the bios...just nothing, then every once and a while it will just start up.	St
1.1.3	When it does I get the resume windows screen, it reboots and then won't start again.	St
1.1.4	I have checked the following: -power supply (checked on a tester and swapped out for different one) -ram (ran memory test - AOK) -ran HDD test - everyting AOK -removed and replaced CPU with new thermal grease Could it be the motherboard, if so how do I check?	St
1.1.5	Also if I do replace the motherboard will any uATX 775 board work as the Compaq one, if I can find it is about 250.00...not worth repairing.	St
1.1.6	Any ideas on my next step would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.7	Thanks Sean	St
1.2.1	What voltage is the CMOS battery?	St
1.2.2	Did you inspect it for BAD CAPS?	St
1.3.1	no apparrent bad caps and voltage on battery is 3.13 Thanks Bob Sean	St
1.4.1	Unplug all USB items.	St
1.4.2	I've seen a BIOS or 2 (actually more) that go out to lunch over that.	St
1.4.3	While we all know 5 year old machines do this, we try a few things first.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	there are no usb items plugged in, only things plugged in are the mouse, keyboard and monitor, unlkess you mean the usb headers n the motherboard as well.	St
1.5.2	Sean	St
1.6.1	Remember that we are dealing with a dying machine so we can try everything and anything to avoid the motherboard.	St
1.6.2	For example I would unplug all CD/HD/DVD drives from the motherboard since we know an IDE short can stop the boot.	St
1.6.3	Same for ANY PCI or other card.	St
1.6.4	Remove what we can and get down to just the motherboard, power supply, CPU and heatsink.	St
1.6.5	If those don't start up and beep in protest for the lack of ram and more then we are looking at the bad parts.	St
1.6.6	Some &quot;test&quot; the power supply but since the RISE TIME of the voltages can cause odd boot issues I've learned to always swap it out.	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	I did do that once (strip everything out) and no post beep.	St
1.7.2	The drives (both dvd and HDD) are SATA not sure if that makes a difference.	St
1.7.3	So I guess it is probably the motherboard then?	St
1.7.4	If so will any uATX MB work, or do I have to put an HP one back in?	St
1.7.5	Thanks again Bob Sean	St
1.8.1	Since the OS dies with the motherboard (please don't start another discussion about &quot;I bought the OS&quot;) be sure to budget not only the motherboard but an OS.	St
1.8.2	This is why we'll do every possible test to assure ourselves it's not the main board.	St
1.8.3	Even fitting a new power supply to be sure.	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Thanks alot Bob, I have already budgeted for Win 7, now a great time to do it, good idea about the power supply too.	St
1.9.2	Cheers Sean	St
