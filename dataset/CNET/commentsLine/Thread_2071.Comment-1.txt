so a couple of days ago i had a post about how i would go about using my external drive on a pc to transfer data (i've been using it on a mac for several years).
i was told that formatting it would erase the content so i opted not to do that.
however, now when i tried to hook it up to the same mac its been used on for years it won't mount at all.
instead it makes a weird clicking noise over and over and will not load!
does this mean the drive is dead and i've lost all my data?!
i have never had a single problem with this drive and just the other day it was working fine.
is there no way to recover the data from my external drive at this point?
?
