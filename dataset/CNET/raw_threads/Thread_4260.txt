5004	0	148703	1659097	NR	Jeremyp815	1/9/06 2:44 PM	1.13681784E12	installed ATI Radeon 9550 GC, Now mon. shutdown in Gameplay	I have an Hp pavilion a735w, AMD3000+ Processor. 512MB Ram, and installed a New ATI Radeon 9550 256AGP Card. NOW when i try and play top end games (or even Half Life and Duke Nukem MP) when selecting New Game, the Monitor either shutsoff and doesnt come back on OR the system will restart. I was told to Upgrade my ram to at least a Gig, install additional case fans. I am also using original 250w power supply. I am new to computer gaming BUT this is really irritating. Also when Pressing Ctrl+Alt.+Del, you see the CPU Usage and when i window a game and open this up it shows i am using 100% cpu. Somebody please help. I am on a Budget and i read this was good if on budget. ALSO ATI Customer service SUCKS!!! Thanks ALL who reply

As for shutting down while NOT playing games, Sometimes. When you run quite a few programs at a time, sometimes it will sometimes it wont. BUT if just letting it run, NO. I ran Limewire and let it go ALL night, got up in morning, Never shutdown. Ive tried contacting ATI about this issue BUT every time i call there number is busy, and I've already registered my Card online, I dont know where else to turn to. Thanks again

5004	6	148703	1684585	1673555	danaranda	1/19/06 7:29 PM	1.13769894E12	same thing happened to me	i just got the same card w/250 watts and the only time it turns off the monitor is in high end video games or when I was doing 3dmark video test. I'm came upon this thread as I was trying to trouble shoot the problem. I have a 400 W psu, hopefully it works.
