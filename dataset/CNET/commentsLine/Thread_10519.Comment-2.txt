athena power 450w microatx:  unfortunately, this looks like it is quite a gamble.
plenty of people had problems getting it to work correctly, or recieved it dead.
that is the only one i could find.
most microatx power supplies are very low capacity.
what you might have to do is take a normal atx supply, and do some creative modding to attach it outside your case.
