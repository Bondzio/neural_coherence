wireless card on an hp dv2000 and starting from today my wireless was unable to detect any networks&quot; 1. how did you get w7 installed?
fresh onto bare metal or upgrade from vista?
2.
&quot;starting from today&quot; means it worked with w7 and then it stopped working?
or it never worked with w7 at all?
3. if original os was vista, did wireless work and connect properly?
fyi, it seems hp does not support w7 on certain older models.
read the following carefully
