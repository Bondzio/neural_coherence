Today there is no &quot;Easy Button&quot; or tool to automate WAP placement and frequency allocations.
At least not in the under 6 figure price ranges.
So put your thinking cap on and make a map of your campus then put the WAPs on the map.
Identify which is at what channel and then just like you do with CELLULAR TOWERS try to keep WAPs off the same channels when they are next to each other.
If you planning is good you can keep it to channels 1, 5 and 11 (some use the 1, 6 and 11 combo) to help with overlaps.
