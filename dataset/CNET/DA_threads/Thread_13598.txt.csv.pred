1.1.1	My PC boots normally under light load for nearly 1 hour if I keep my PC OFF for nearly 1 day .	St
1.1.2	It may run smoothly for more than 1 hour but I never checked it .	St
1.1.3	( I can play songs , movie , browse internet simultaneously ) .If I restart the PC , it freezes .	St
1.1.4	And if I try to boot it again , it doesnt boot .	St
1.1.5	I keep it OFF for 1 hour .	St
1.1.6	After 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again .	St
1.1.7	Mouse and keyboard also stop working .	St
1.1.8	The only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off .	St
1.1.9	So if I want to run it for long time , I need to keep it OFF at least 1 day and I cant restart it .	St
1.1.10	I checked RAM .	St
1.1.11	IT is working fine .	St
1.1.12	My configuration is AMD phenom x2 550 black edition .	St
1.1.13	ASUS M2N68-AM Plus motherboard PSU : Xtech 450-24 , Max 450w GPU : NVIDIA GeForce 7025/nforce 630a Initial processor temperature is 36C which increases to 48C in 5 mins under zero load .	St
1.1.14	I have updated my BIOS version from 0701 to 0804 .	St
1.1.15	So what could be the problem ?	Ques
1.1.16	?	Ques
1.2.1	Remove the side case cover and point a box fan ( those 2 to 3 foot fans ) at the machine and retest .	St
1.2.2	If it runs longer it means that some part is heat sensitive .	St
1.2.3	Your guess which .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Open case and clean out the dust bunnies .	St
1.3.2	Leave side cover off and see if the system stays running longer .	St
1.3.3	If not , then place fan to help cool it .	St
1.3.4	If it continues to cause a problem at the same stop intervals as before , you may have a & quot ; bad caps & quot ; situation , google for examples .	St
1.3.5	Next , your PSU maybe petering out , check all fans to see they 're running to include PSU one ( if present ) .	St
1.3.6	I wo n't return side until it appears fixed .	St
1.3.7	If upon returning side cover and it still stops/freezes , then you have some component ( anything ) that 's been compromised by heat stress and will fail all together at some future point .	St
1.3.8	Then and only then will it becomes obvious as it will work intermittently until failure .	St
1.3.9	In this case only swapping parts may do to help determine cause .	St
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
