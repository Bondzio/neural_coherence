hi, i am for sure getting the e8500 core 2 duo cpu, and later planning on getting a radeon 4890. the cpu is very nice but i'm wondering if it would bottleneck the card at all and if so, to what degree.
i'm also planning on getting a new 750 watt psu at the same time as the card and my current system also has 4 gigs (only 3.3 usable from vista 32 bit) of 667 ram.
any estimations would be appreciated, thanks in advance.
