1.1.1	I am planning for an upgrade (a cheap upgrade, at least).	St
1.1.2	These are recent specs: Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz (see it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_d ) DDR 400 (1GB) 2 HDD: Western Digital (320GB,SATA) and Samsung (40GB,IDE) Internal video card (32MB) Windows XP SP2 I need advices on what hardware/software should I put in to keep it fast.	St
1.1.3	I also have plans of playing high spec games like Call of Duty 4, Left for Dead, Xmen Origins, etc., but I was worrying about the bus speed of my motherboard.	St
1.1.4	I still use DDRs (which has 400MHz transfer rate), meaning I use an old motherboard (I forgot the brand, sorry!)	St
1.1.5	If I reached (at least minimum) specs of these games, can I still play these games smoothly under these bus speeds?	St
1.1.6	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	I'd say make a minimalist install of FreeBSD with xfce, blackbox, lxsession, or fluxbox as the window manager; but then you wouldn't have games.	St
1.2.2	External video card with enough memory for the game.	St
1.2.3	Windows sucks and is insecure; but, since you insist on using it, only install the basics you need.	St
1.3.1	(Well I hope you're not promoting a product, eh?)	St
1.3.2	Uhm...let me see...I think I won't opt to change my OS (and I think FreeBSD is a gamble since you said &quot;...but then you wouldn't have games.&quot;).	St
1.3.3	Thanks anyway.	Polite
1.3.4	&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;External video card with enough memory for the game.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; So if I upgraded to let's say 2GB DDR for a 2GB required game, would it be performing the same as a 2GB DDR2 machine runing the same game?	St
1.3.5	Meaning bus speeds won't affect gameplay..is that what you mean?	St
1.3.6	(same for the video card thinggy...My slot says AGP 8x.	St
1.3.7	I don't have PCI-E.	St
1.3.8	I think.)	St
1.3.9	Help!	St
1.4.1	Look on google shopping for agp 8x.	St
1.4.2	Let's assume that you will need 256M as a minimum.	St
1.4.3	Part of the game performance or any performance depends on how much memory goes to graphics.	St
1.4.4	My card is embedded so I lose up to 128M memeory and up to 98% CPU when rendering occurs.	St
1.5.1	Well, complying with the memory is an easy task, since we can just readily buy the card with the appropriate memory.	St
1.5.2	But how 'bout the bus speed?	St
1.5.3	That's already becoming my concern.	St
1.5.4	Changing the bus speed means changing the motherboard, right?	St
1.5.5	(I think I won't be resorting to that.	St
1.5.6	It's like buying a new PC already.)	St
1.5.7	I hope I could get a specific answer.	St
1.5.8	Thanks anyway!	St
