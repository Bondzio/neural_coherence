13755	3	296874	2786405	2786255	ramarc	6/4/08 5:55 AM	1.2125589E12	examples	since you've got a high-end mobo and i expect you'll be overclocking, and you could go sli in the future, get a good 700w or larger unit. ocz 700w, $125 before $30 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341002 corsair 750w, $130 before $10 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006

The components looked good to me. If I were doing it, I'd prob'ly get 2x2GB rather than 4x1 GB. For my recent build I got 2x2 GB fast DDR2 for under $100 and there's also a $30 mail-in rebate (altho I'm still waiting for it, and we all know rebates don't always actually show up in your mailbox...) 2 sticks are easier to manage on a mobo, plus it leaves me the possibility of bumping up to 8 GB if I need to convert my own machine into a work computer. (my work requires good computing power, but home is usually just for gaming/hobby stuff) Of course if the OS license is a 32-bit, then there's no incentive to go to 4 GB, let alone 8, so can't be sure what's best for your rig.

13755	8	296874	2787601	2787317	ramarc	6/5/08 1:20 PM	1.212672E12	8800gt should be fine for 1680x1050 2xAA in COD4	these 4xAA figures are borderline, so 2xAA will be smooth. http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/xfx-gf8800gts_7.html#sect1
