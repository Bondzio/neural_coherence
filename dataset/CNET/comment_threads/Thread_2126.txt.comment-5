after reading all my mind can handle on graphics cards and psu from manufactures sites to reviews on cnet and other sites, the questions sticking me are.... what would get me the best benefits, upgrading from nvidia 7500 le to a card for around a $80-$120 that works with-in my PSU(350w), or for around $220 upgrading both PSU(to 500w-750w) and GPU.
Are there any draw backs to raising the psu in a system?
Would the extra bucks really get me a bigger bang?
