<s> I have an HP Pavilion tx2000 laptop [Old, I know, but it's been fixed up from it's previous mess and made like new and improved again] And when i flip it over I see what looks like some kind of fan. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it is the fan but it closely resembles one and it's right next to the vents. </s>
<s> Hot, hot air blows out when i play either the sims 3 or when it's charging, and i'm wondering if it's due to this so called &quot;fan&quot; i'm looking at. </s>
<s> I am planning on buying a cooling pad in the nearby future but i'd like to know what i can do now to check. </s>
<s> There's some dust inside from where i can see it and it looks like it's on one of the blades. </s>
<s> open up the computer and take a look. </s>
<s> But if hot air is &quot;blowing out&quot; then it seems to me the fan might be ok. </s>
<s> Most of these fans are quiet and generally run regardless. </s>
<s> However, they do &quot;auto-sense&quot; the temp and will turn-ON and work if idled. </s>
<s> There's nothing to keep from general cleaning by using an air can to blow any dust bunnies. </s>
<s> If able to more directly access the fan, do that as well. </s>
<s> If you find the fan has actually stopped or not working, replace with similar fan. </s>
<s> Since, you're already thinking a cooling pad, get that ASAP. </s>
<s> It will help if the fan is iffy operation until fixed. </s>
<s> If this laptop is older as you've mentioned, then maybe wear&tear finally caught-up with the fan, replace it why leave thought. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
