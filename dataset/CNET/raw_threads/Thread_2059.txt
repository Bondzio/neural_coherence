I see these to be 2 year affairs and this looks like it got 4 years according to it showing up in May, 2009 (source http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULDAKA ) The HP DJ3520 looks to be it's replacement for about 70 which is less than I expect a service call to cost. http://www.amazon.com/Hewlett-Packard-Deskjet-DJ3520-Wireless/dp/B00847V1EA/ (source) When I needed a new printer I asked the moderators and a few noted the Canon MX870 and that's been great. A little heavy and I used the fax once but it's replacement is the MX922 which my neighbor picked up and they like how easy it was to set up.
