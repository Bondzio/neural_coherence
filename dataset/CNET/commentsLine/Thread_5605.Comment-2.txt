since no os is noted, no models either i'll offer the usual.
1. boot safe mode (no, i don't tell how.
look on google.)
2. if windows shows up, set the video mode to 800x600 and ok your way back to the windows screen.
3. click start and restart the machine.
sorry for the lack of detail but this is all about learning how to find information.
