I'd suggestyou build your own.
Right now there's a free course forming on CNET that covers building your own computer.
It's for a high powered gaming system, but the principles are all the same; only the components would be different for a slower system.
You can get MOBO and processor combinations pretty cheap.
If you have a Micro Center near by, you can go look at the MOBO and decide what you want; need.
Shop online for the operating system.
