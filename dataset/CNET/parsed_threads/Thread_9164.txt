<s> Hello, We have a internal network with 4 pc's connected to our university network. </s>
<s> We are going to do a lot of video and we need a lot of bandwith, we want to make our 4 pc network use 1Gig ethernet to share video files faster but want to avoid having to go outside our network and use the university resources. </s>
<s> Can regular switches recognise the 4 pc network and avoid going outside and send it straight between those pc and only going outside to surf the internet or whatever??? </s>
<s> These must be done usually with a programmable switch but someone told me nowdays regular switches are able to do this. </s>
<s> Is it true? </s>
<s> How can it be done? </s>
<s> If it is, but basic models could I get? </s>
<s> If not what programmable switch which is cheap could I get? </s>
<s> By the way we'll be using (an can only use) windows XP, no Linux...;-( Thanks </s>
<s> internet -&gt; wifi router -&gt; 1GB switched hub -&gt; PCs. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So a regular (not programmable, then much cheaper) 1G switch will not send the files outside our local network through the university resources? </s>
<s> It would take care of it internally??? </s>
<s> By the way we wont be using wireless, all cable. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> A Gigabit router would do what you want. </s>
<s> But let me share something about Gigabit LANs. </s>
<s> You will NOT get Gigabit speed. </s>
<s> No hard drive made will read/write at that speed. </s>
<s> My Gigabit network running two IBM ThinkCenter 3 GHz processors with Gigabit and my home built 2 GHz processor with Gigabit runs on average 250-350 Mb/s speed. </s>
<s> Faster than my old 10/100 LAN, but nowhere near 1000 Mb/s speed. </s>
<s> If the above speed meets your needs then just get a Gigabit router. </s>

<s> Can anybody specify brands and models? </s>
<s> So is clear that I dont need a programmable switch, a regular giga switch will do it, right? </s>
<s> Why not a giga switch (seems cheaper) thatn a Giga router? </s>
<s> What benefits do I get getting a Giga router, I just want to be able to send big video files across the small pc network, is it worth it? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Hello, I going to buy a 3COM SWITCH OFFICE CONNECT 8XRJ45 10/100/1000 GIGABIT,AUTOSENSING, AUTO MDI/MDIX. </s>
<s> Will this do wha I want? </s>

<s> Wireless if you need it in the future. </s>
<s> It also has what's called &quot;Storage Link&quot;. </s>
<s> A USB-2 port where you can connect a USB-2 hard drive. </s>
<s> Use it as storage, it shows up in your network as a shared network drive. </s>
<s> Pick your size. </s>
<s> I have an 80 Gig hard drive I use for &quot;stuff&quot;. </s>
<s> It looks impressive and expensive...anyhow does anyone know if the one I'm willing to buy will do what I'm asking...I dont have option to buy what your recomend, since I have to buy it for the university dealer and thats the option they have give me. </s>
<s> Thanks? </s>
<s> All I did was add the switched hub at the end... </s>
<s> I didn't answer directly what a switched hub is since that would duplicate fine content at Wikipedia or what you can find at google.com but it is the answer. </s>
<s> I prefer the switched hub outside the router since I've found some switches in routers to be poor performers. </s>
<s> You want cheap? </s>
<s> Try http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CGS-800E-DT&cat=NET and the other Netgear, Dlink, Linksys equivilents. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'll be getting the 3COM SWITCH OFFICE CONNECT because is what the store has, cant buy from the internet because university rules. </s>
<s> So I hope it works...I was on a tight deadline so I had to get something real quick the thing is at the store the could not answer my question? </s>
<s> That's why I tried here, so lets see what happens. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
