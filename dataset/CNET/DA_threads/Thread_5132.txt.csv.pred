1.2.1	There 's tons of different heatsinks out there several of which can face different directions of that gets in the way .	St
1.2.2	P.S .	St
1.2.3	I believe 'those cylindrical things just south of the cpu mount ' is the heatsink for the northbridge on the motherboard .	St
1.3.1	not that side i mean the opposite side , the closest things to the cpu	St
1.4.1	Like I said , there tons of different heatsinks out there , and it would n't make sense for the manufacturer of the motherboard ( Intel looks like ) to make one that interfered with the placing of the heatsink .	St
1.5.1	i gave u the wrong link , heres the real one .	St
1.5.2	the one i posted above would deffinately not fit on my cpu because its my case lol : $ 21 cpu fan and heat sink : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835150082	Ques
1.6.1	hahaha !	St
1.6.2	I was wondering why the case link was there .	St
1.6.3	I do n't see anyway of telling simply by looking at the images though .	St
1.6.4	I would say go for it , but , if you 're really not sure , it 's not too hard to pick out a different motherboard .	St
