1.2.1	After looking at the spec .	St
1.2.2	and prices of varying unit ... only Crucial has a 5 years warranty ( that was printed that I can see ) ..strange ; and only Kingston has an SLC unit ( slc suppose to be better than mlc ) .	St

1.3.1	i ended up buying a cavalry 32gb ( casd00032mis ) from amazon .	St
1.3.2	it has great review plus a usb port in case i want to use it as a portable.. http : //www.amazon.com/s/ref=amb_link_6488902_20 ? ie=UTF8 & node=541966 & keywords=Solid % 2BState % 2BHard % 2BDrive & pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER & pf_rd_s=left-1 & pf_rd_r=138W4ER4SC6ATEJ74WPX & pf_rd_t=101 & pf_rd_p=473285071 & pf_rd_i=193870011 i figure that if this low cap one works out well , i 'll try something higher capacity like the cavalry 64gb or 128gb ssds .

1.4.3	Intel 30GB is selling for around $ 370 and OCZ is right now for $ 99 .	St
1.4.4	I have been using this website http : //www.easypricetracker.com/searchex.wsh/ocz+ssd/0/0/25/0/0/-/-1/-1/result.html to check for prices and price charts - hopefully prices will go down to $ 69 which is the lowest reported by this site .	St
