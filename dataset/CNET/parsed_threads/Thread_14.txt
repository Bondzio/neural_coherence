<s> Hello, My BIOS does not &quot;remember&quot; my settings, for some items. </s>
<s> It does remember the date and time. </s>
<s> When I turn on the computer, it says: CMOS checksum error. </s>
<s> Loading Default settings. </s>
<s> I have to press F1 to continue. </s>
<s> Since this problem started I also can not use the scanner, which is a part of an HP laser printer (printer+scanner+fax+copier in one machine). </s>
<s> The errors I get are: The scanner is already in use (it is not! </s>
<s> ); A driver is missing; A device conflict etc. </s>
<s> What is wrong? </s>
<s> Are these problems connected? </s>
<s> They started at the same time. </s>
<s> Thank you, Mogi. </s>
