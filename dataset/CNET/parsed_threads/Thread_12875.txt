<s> Hi, I currently have 2 services coming in both with internet access. </s>
<s> One is wired ethernet (has a passworded proxy to get out to the internet, used for all local traffic) the other is wireless straight into an ADSL modem so unrestricted internet access. </s>
<s> Currently everything is run through the ethernet solution and when I need un-firewalled access or am using an application that doesn't support the passworded proxy I switch over to the wireless but lose all local connectivity. </s>
<s> Is there a way I can somehow route all of my local traffic in the 192.168.x.x range to the ethernet, and all the internet traffic (even certain applications) through the wireless connection? </s>
<s> I would like to be able to work both locally as well as some apps on the unrestricted connection at once. </s>
<s> Opening firewall ports or adding an exception to the proxy is not an option. </s>
<s> I'm open to ideas on Vista as well though prefer XP. </s>
<s> Cheers, M. </s>
<s> That's not a feature of this OS and I must be blunt here that to use Linux to do this or other solutions you wouldn't be asking but doing so those are not a solution today. </s>
<s> So I must write no. </s>
<s> BOb </s>
