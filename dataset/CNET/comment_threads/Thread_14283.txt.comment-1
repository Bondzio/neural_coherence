First off, let me say that I know very little about hardware...I'm more of a software guy.
That being said, a few days ago, I built this new PC: Chaintech V915P Mobo GeForce 6200 256mb video card 1gb 3200 Corsair Ram 120gb Western Digital HD w/ 8mb cache Intel 3.0ghz Processor 1mb cache (Socket 775) The processor is the problem I am concerned about.
it's running at 60C at idle.
i have 2 80mm case fans in it.
But I'm going to be adding more.
I would like to know how I would go about cooling it down.
Just looking for suggestions.
I'm thinking I might try a third party heat sink, right now I'm using Intel's.
Thanks
