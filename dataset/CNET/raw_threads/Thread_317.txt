Unfortunately it has only one port, for connection to PC. I want to network my Dell 3100cn laser printer which is not wireless. I have tried connecting a NEWLINK 5 port hub using the uplink to the wireless router but the router cannot recognise connection. The port next to the uplink is empty and I have used NON-crossover cabling. Can anyone advise me on how to network my printer.

I connected the PC to port 1 on a Netlink 5 port Ethernet switch, and connected the Uplink port to the only port on the Siemens Gigaset SE572 WLAN dsl. The WLAN cannot detect the Netlink. I can get the printer networked via the Netlink, no problem, but as the Siemens unit has only 1 port I have to connect it directly to the PC to enable me to access the internet. I assumed I would be able to connect as in para 1, then connect the printer to port 2 on the Netlink and all would be well!!! The software for the Siemens unit is installed and working ok. Again thanks for your time.
