First off I did not realise a DVD drive used two lasers to read either DVD and normal CD Rom + Music disks.
How long should a DVD or other Optical drive last?
My drive still plays all my music CDs and can read CD Roms but it will not read any of my movies any more.
All they do is spin the drive up and then it says there is &quot;no disk in drive.&quot; Drive is about 14 months old.
Is this how long these things are meant to last these days?
