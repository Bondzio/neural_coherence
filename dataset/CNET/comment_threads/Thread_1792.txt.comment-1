I am trying to reinstall the operating system on my computer, HP Pavilion 520n, I insert the Windows CD and go through the proccess of creating the partition, formatting, and copying the files but after it does that it will not boot up to the C drive and finish the installation instead it boots back up to the CD.
I tried setting it to boot to the C drive first but it won't it will boot to the CD!
Anybody have any ideas why?
Thank you!
