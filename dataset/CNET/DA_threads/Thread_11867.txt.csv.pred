1.1.1	I could not find a specific forum for video/graphic card, so here it goes.	St
1.1.2	I am thinking about upgrading my graphic card to a Sapphire Radeon HD 3850 AGP card.	St
1.1.3	On its web site it states the power supply requirement is 450W.	St
1.1.4	The current power supply on board is only 400W.	St
1.1.5	So I am wondering if the power supply requirement is &quot;sticky&quot;, or if there's any room to wiggle.	St
1.1.6	Has anybody &quot;exceeded&quot; the power supply requirement and experienced trouble with their machine?	St
1.1.7	I certainly don't want to upgrade the video card, then have to upgrade my power supply after.	St
1.2.1	But it all comes down to amps per rail and we have to get very technical.	St
1.2.2	And to head off any question, YOU get to find the numbers.	St
1.2.3	That said I am running an old AGP HIS (another maker) ATI 3650 512MB on a 230 Watt PSU.	St
1.2.4	The entire box averages 140 Watts on a Watt meter so I'm just there.	St
1.2.5	I don't suggest anyone exceed the 50% mark.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	unless you're willing to upgrade the PSU too.	St
1.3.2	Some indicate PSUs deteriorate over time so if your PSU is not new, it may be further below the spec than 50 watts.	St
1.3.3	Make sure to note what connectors the GPU requires so you have the right PSU support.	St
1.3.4	Mfg specs state &quot;450Watt or greater power supply with 30Amps on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommended&quot; http://www1.sapphiretech.com/us/products/products_overview.php?gpid=227&grp=2 VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	So your power supply is only 230W, and it's running the 3650 card, which uses 140W of that power alone?	St
1.5.1	The entire system is drawing that much.	St
1.5.2	I have the advantage of being equipped with Watt and Amp meters so I can measure what's going on.	St
1.5.3	I also have the 3650 and not the 3850.	St
1.5.4	Not many will trouble themselves to measure Watts and Amps so can't do this.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	hello there, donot worry about the power supply too much if you donot overclock or if you are not a hardcore gamer to the core.In this link here *************************************************************** http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp ************************************************************** you can calculate the power requirement.It works good.	St
1.7.1	But power supplies never run at there stated power and realistically you only get about 85% efficiency of that number.	St
1.7.2	So keep that in mind.	St
1.7.3	Also, stock PSU's typically do not come with the 2 4-pin connectors.	St
1.7.4	They barely come with SATA power.	St
1.7.5	You can easily pick up PSU's cheap these days, so it may be within your means to pick one up with your card.	St
1.7.6	That way you pave the way for future upgrades.	St
1.7.7	Also, if it's a stock dell, I do not recommend adding an aftermarket PSU as Dell has been known for it's proprietary hardware.	St
1.8.1	but it's definitely lower for run of the mill PSUs and older/aging PSUs.	St
1.8.2	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	Well.. this is more than sufficient, and its on sale at my site for $80.	St
1.9.2	its perfect even if you will be upgrading down the line.. take a look.. the APEVIA ATX-AS680W-BL 680W Power Supply http://pcreviewer.org/neweggcom-double-shellshocker-supersale/	St
