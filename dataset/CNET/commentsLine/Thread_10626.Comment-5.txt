hello, well i think i have finally decided on what combination i am going to go with.
i have decided to just go with the geforce 6600gt 256mb graphics card.
i had a look at the asus motherboard that is the next model down from mine the a8n-e, which costs aud$167.
this has no firewire and if i was to buy an add in card which would probably cost aud$30, this would put it above the price of the asus a8n-sli (aud$189) which has firewire onboard.
however people keep on telling me sli is not worth having so the dfi lanparty ut ultra d is only aud$222 which is only an extra $33 on top of the a8n-sli.
i have heard good things about the lanparty series of boards so i think the base specs of my pc will be: dfi lanparty ut ultra d amd dual core 3800+ cpu 1024mb ddr-533 memory 200 gig western digital hard drive 19'' widescreen lcd monitor 16x liteon dual layer dvd-rw geforce 6600gt 256mb what do you guys reckon of this, cheers benny
