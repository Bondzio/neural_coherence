vms reached a consumery feel with the x window system on their risc based boxes.
my bet is you could use such with your windows background.
as to a 64-bit application you can use today and something you might use, let me offer virtual dub.
it's very nice to see it in 64-bit mode.
there are others as well.
your words are the same ones that people wrote when the transition from the 80286 to 80386 happened as well as from dos to windows 3.1 to 95 to 98 to 2000 to xp and more... don't get caught in the same old traps.
just fyi.
i'm really enjoying the 64-bit machines.
you?
and we also have a honda civic hybrid.
i've been told that technology is in the future since it really doesn't work either.
but we whiz down the road anyhow.
