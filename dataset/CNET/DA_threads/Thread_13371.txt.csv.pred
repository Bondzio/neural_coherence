1.1.1	Okay , it 's not all that often that I can not resolve my own computer problems with a little time and energy searching the Internet , but I thought I would just ask if anyone else is having similar issues .	St
1.1.2	With both the August and September versions of the ATI Catalyst software suite and drivers , my system experiences extreme slowdown to the point where I can barely even open the Task Manager .	St
1.1.3	When it does open , I find the Explorer.exe process using nearly 100 % of the CPU , and the CPU is never released for other processes .	St
1.1.4	The September version actually caused my system to lock up -- sometimes immediately after typing my password to log into Windows .	St
1.1.5	After about 2 1/2 hours , I was finally able to fully pull all traces of the new drivers out of my system ( using Revo Uninstaller ) and install the July Catalyst version , which seems to work perfectly .	St
1.1.6	I 'm posting my system specs below for comparison , but I was wondering if anyone else has been having this type of issue with newer Catalyst releases .	St
1.1.7	I have one more question , which I 'll get to after the specs .	St
1.1.8	Abit KV-85 motherboard AMD Sempron 2800+ 1 GB of PC3200 DDR SDRAM Windows XP SP 3 with all current updates ATI Radeon X1650 Pro , 512 MB RAM ( no onboard video on the motherboard ) SoundBlaster Live !	St
1.1.9	24-bit sound card These are the critical internal components , but if you think I need to post the rest of the hardware , let me know .	St
1.1.10	My other question concerns removal of the Catalyst suite .	St
1.1.11	After the running the built-in uninstaller and rebooting , if I open Revo Uninstaller , it will still show a number of different components associated with the Catalyst Control Center , such as Core Blending , Graphics Full Existing , Graphics Full New , et al .	St
1.1.12	In order to uninstall them using Revo , you have to uninstall each one of them MANUALLY ; even the most advanced scan wo n't remove all of them simultaneously , and there are about 10 or so such components total .	St
1.1.13	SO , is there a reliable way to ensure that ALL TRACES of these drivers are removed through one uninstaller ?	Ques
1.1.14	Just for the record , last night , I also downloaded a tool from ATI 's site that is supposed to do that , but even it did n't work .	St
1.1.15	I think that 's because it 's such an old utility , and I could n't find a more modern one .	St
1.1.16	I appreciate any information .	Polite
1.1.17	I can get by with the July release of the drivers as they work just fine ; I 'm mainly trying to determine if I 'm having some kind of system issue or if ATI/AMD is just getting really sloppy with its driver releases .	St
1.1.18	Thanks again .	St
1.2.1	and there 's no need to update drivers since they 're only going to concentrate on the latest two generations ( hd 4000/3000 ) .	St
1.2.2	stick with what works unless a driver promises to cure so specific issue you 're experiencing .	St
1.2.3	p.s .	St
1.2.4	: i have no issues with my hd 4850 and the 8.8 ( august ) drivers and wo n't be upgrading to 8.9 ( september ) .	St
1.3.1	Well , that 's interesting to know .	St
1.3.2	I 'm really having no issues with the July driver , so I guess I 'll stick with it for now .	St
1.3.3	I just think it 's interesting that the release notes ( I read those before downloading any video driver update ) claim to support this particular card , and yet the drivers essentially crash my computer .	St
1.3.4	False advertising , anyone ?	Ques
1.3.5	Anyway , thanks again for the information .	Polite
