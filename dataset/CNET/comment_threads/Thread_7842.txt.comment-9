One more time...the old battery was worn out it was a 3 volt battery that read .4 volts on a multimeter.
The new battery is a 3 volt battery that reads 3 volts.
Prior to replacing the battery the PC would not display anything on the monitor.
Nor it appears that the BIOS is lost.
Forget the battery !
