<s> I have a Microtek Scanmaker E3 flatbed scanner that is several years old (guess 5 or 6 years - predates USB scanners). </s>
<s> I have tried Omni Form Filler and I just got ScanSoft's Paper Port 10. </s>
<s> Neither program will copy forms correctly that are lined. </s>
<s> I also have Omni Pro and Pagis and have very few problems scanning plain text documents with them, so I know the scanner works OK. </s>
<s> When I copy a form with lines, sometime I get the form just as formatted but no lines and sometime I just get the form that was a page full of text and lines reproduced as just the text squeezed into a paragraph at the top of the page, with all the lines gone. </s>
<s> So I wonder, is it the scanner or the software? </s>
<s> I just bought Page Port 10 and still have a few days left on the return guarantee. </s>
<s> Is there better software out there or should I be looking at a better scanner? </s>
<s> If the scanner scans to a image file or copies to the printer ok, then its a software issue. </s>
<s> Just sharing that I've yet to see any consumer grade form filler software that everyone likes. </s>
