<s> Hi, I have a machine with Win XP pro running, there is nothing special with the hardware, its standard. </s>
<s> Now suddenly I cant turn the machine on, every time I press the power on button, I hear a bleep sound and the monitor stays blank. </s>
<s> I cant even enter the machine to format it... what should I do to make a simple format? </s>
<s> maybe it is a hardware issue regards, Mirza </s>
<s> The beeps are a code to tell you what's wrong. </s>
<s> Now check in the motherboard manual what this particular combination of beeps (for example: 1 short one, 2 long ones) means. </s>
<s> The usuals: - bad RAM - bad CPU - bad motherboard Yes, it's surely hardware. </s>
<s> Formatting doesn't make any sense. </s>

<s> ok, thanks actually it was a memory error, I changed the slots of my ram, now I'm able to start my pc but after the initial screen the monitor simply fades to black, I cant start a formatting, anything...the old win xp installation cannot be started regards, mirza </s>
<s> You can't format from the old win xp installation. </s>
<s> You can only format from the xp installation CD. </s>
<s> So it might be time to find that. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I have the xp cd, but the problem is when I boot from the cd during startup (first boot device set to cd rom) then the installation cannot be started, for some strange reason... </s>
<s> must be hardware-related. </s>
<s> Maybe still a RAM issue, maybe something else. </s>
<s> Why not try memtest86 (free download) first? </s>
<s> Anyway, you're unlikely to get any effective help if you don't tell more about the issue than that it has a &quot;strange reason&quot;. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> ok..thanks, what details do you need about the machine and the problem? </s>
<s> regards mirza </s>
