Video playback on a tablet is something I would do rarely, I'm of the opinion that if I want to watch a movie I have a perfectly good TV not far away, it's something I would do say while travelling.
I know the galaxy tab supports more file types but a friend with an iPad has shown me a useful app that will do the same thing.
I know adding/deleting music is so much easier on iTunes, add the song and sync, I tried to add a song (just one) to HTC sync manager and the program tried to add the entire folder.
As for data storage, I agree with you Bob, there are a lot more services out there like the iCloud and Dropbox that I could use if need be.
So far the iPad is seeming a better option for me.
