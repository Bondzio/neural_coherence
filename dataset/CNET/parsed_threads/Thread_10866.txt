<s> I have created a workgroup for my two laptops which run Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> I can see whatever it is I want to share on each of the computers. </s>
<s> My question is, can anyone else see my files/folders without the group name? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> unsaid and cannot be fully answered until the details or your two node network are revealed. </s>
<s> Router/wired/wireless/security enabled are all needed info. </s>
<s> I am using a wireless router for my interenet connection to both computers which is unsecured. </s>
<s> In which case your workgroup will be exposed when not protected by WEP/WPA and or MAC filtering. </s>
<s> You may wish to disable SSID broadcasting and change the default name and password of the router. </s>
<s> My router is password protected but the ssid is not &quot;protected&quot; is that ok? </s>
<s> turned on or off. </s>
<s> I've found that MAC filtering is usually enough in most home environments since many will trip over WEP/WPA encryption. </s>
<s> it is enabled WEP is an Open system and it says WEP is disabled. </s>
<s> to what has been suggested. </s>
<s> Have you enabled MAC filtering, this is the easiest and least troublesome of the security options in a router. </s>
<s> Enable MAC Filtering now and see what happens. </s>
<s> I am checking the button only allow computers with MAC addresses listed below to access the network. </s>
<s> It then lists my computers in the DHCP Client drop down list so I'll see what happens. </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
