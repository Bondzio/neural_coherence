all you need to do is match the connectors.
the types that offer a second power connector will sometimes work better as not all usb ports can provide the same amount of current.
sometimes, however, an apparent cable failure is a poor connection at the device itself.
these aren't always easy to troubleshoot.
another option might be to buy another external enclosure that comes with its own cable and put the hard drive in that.
you'd have to pull the drive out to make sure it's no some proprietary design.
i've heard that some external drives have the usb connection as part of the controller rather than an sata to internal adapter.
since you didn't ask any specific question such as &quot;will this work&quot; or &quot;what should i do&quot;, that's about all i can offer.
you try and find a cable with the extra power connector or try another enclosure.
good luck.
