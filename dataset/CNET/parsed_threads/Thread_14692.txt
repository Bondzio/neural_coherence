<s> First post, i'm relatively ignorant to this pc tech stuff, and need some help. </s>
<s> I've recently realized that my 16 gig hard drive only has about 600mb still avaiable. </s>
<s> I'm looking around to see what's taking up so much space when I find out my &quot;documents and settings&quot; folder is 7 gigs. </s>
<s> However, I cannot find any files within this folder that even come close to adding up to 7 gigs. </s>
<s> What could possibly be causing this folder to take up so much space if there's nothing that large in it?... </s>
<s> nothing I can see, anyway? </s>
<s> Any info would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Explorer is not a directory and file browser. </s>
<s> Oh, what a statement you may think, but why does it hide items and show items that are not directories and files? </s>
<s> Here's what I use -&gt; Guyla's Navigator. </s>
<s> A little quirky to some, but free and is a file/directory browser. </s>
