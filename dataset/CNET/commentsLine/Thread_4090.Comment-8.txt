i had them build a mid-tier gaming system for me and it was well shipped, and worked perfectly and i am happy.
i found them after some research on the 'net and yes there isn't much out there review-wise but it was mostly positive and i took the plunge.
i'd recommend them.
of course you will save money building your own system but i went the more expensive route.
it seemed also a better bet than cyberpower, ibuypower or dell's alienware.
