<s> Will a Prescott series P4 operate properly in any 800Mhz mainboard or does it require special chipset support. </s>
<s> I tend to think that because the main difference between the Prescott and other 800Mhz P4s is the L2 cache AND that it is an on-die cache, it should not require any special mainboard but...... </s>
<s> I could be wrong. </s>
<s> Also what types of uses is the 1meg L2 cache going to benefit the most? </s>
<s> The answer is not so simple. </s>
<s> The BIOS must support it as well. </s>
<s> Some boards didn't boot until the BIOS was updated. </s>
<s> Since you didn't share the make/model of the motherboard, you didn't give the forums a chance to find out if said P4 was supported. </s>
<s> So far, we read just P4 w/800MHz FSB and &quot;Prescott&quot;. </s>
<s> There is a lot of parallels between the auto-parts stories and this one. </s>
<s> There's a long story about buying a replacement lamp for the headlights. </s>
<s> It's amazing the details that are needed to know what fits what. </s>
<s> Same story here. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>

<s> That actually IS the short answer as the rest of the research I can do myself now that I know there's no &quot;simple&quot; answer. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Still wondering where (what types of apps) the benefit from the larger L2 would be.. </s>
<s> I know SETI runs get shorter and the HT is supported in most Linux and XP to give almost everything a boost. </s>
<s> Look to http://www.tomshardware.com and you may find some CPU benchmarks of interest. </s>
<s> BEWARE that the 64-bit wave is getting closer. </s>
<s> Don't overinvest... Bob </s>
<s> Fred, Motto: Just enough is never enough. </s>
<s> Enough is too much. </s>
<s> Too much is just right! </s>
<s> So, we're talking about socket 478 motherboards equipped with a chipset supporting 800MHz system bus and Prescott (PSC) CPUs. </s>
<s> Yep, there's a small public documented info amount. </s>
<s> At present the landscape is that Prescott requires at least FMB 1.5 (FMB means Flexible Motherboard Guidelines). </s>
<s> So, the main correlation is between CPU - and - Motherboard's FMB#. </s>
<s> For example, installing a PSC FMB 1.5 CPU into a FMB 1.0 motherboard could not work at all - or - work unsatisfactorily. </s>
<s> I'd show two examples: - Full Prescott Compatibility section of this page . </s>
<s> - Intel's genuine motherboards. </s>
<s> One can see from this page the minimum AA# for PSC support. </s>
