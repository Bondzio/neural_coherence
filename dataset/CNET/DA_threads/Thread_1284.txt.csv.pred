1.1.1	Dell Dimension 8400 , Win7 OS , Office 2007 Added second HDD since first HDD is filling up .	St
1.1.2	Is there a way to save info on second HDD automatically after the first HDD fills up ?	Ques
1.1.3	Also , will the PC search both the first HDD and second HDD automatically after the fisrt HDD fills up ?	Ques
1.2.1	There is no automatic search for new space in order to continue on as it were .	St
1.2.2	The system uses what it is & quot ; directed & quot ; to place data .	St
1.2.3	Once the new HD is installed , you need to either tell the system/pgm .	St
1.2.4	where to place data or configure it to do so .	St
1.2.5	The original pgm .	St
1.2.6	is the method to place whatever data is stored at , you may or will need as stated configure to a larger storage area if that 's what you mean this is not done automatically .	St
1.2.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	If your'e familiar in RAID configuration in hard drives then this might help you.By doing this , you 'll let the system treat 2 or multiple physical disk into one logical unit making it easier for the user and the operating system used to configure storage within each application .	St
1.5.1	posted ?	Ques
1.5.2	You 've posted the same response to two different questions neither of which addressed RAID .	St
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	* offtopic -Oh i 'm sorry about that but once i replied to the problem , I do n't know what happened cause my browser automatically redirected me to the wrong page in which i bet you see the same post .	St
1.6.2	i ca n't delete my other post so what 's the solution ? besides it 's not my intention to double post	Ques
1.7.1	I see that you have it all in drive C. The partitioning of a HD is used to give him efficiency .	St
1.7.2	The HD are zoned , ie , the number of sectors per track increases as you go off from the center , keeping the density constant .	St
1.7.3	So , the outer tracks have a larger transfer rate , almost the double of the inner ones .	St
1.7.4	The first partition is the first from the ouside and so on .	St
1.7.5	If you create a first partition ( which will be C ) for your software and swapp files ( virtual memory ) you will greatly improve your system performance .	St
1.7.6	Do n't forget that a volume must never be almost full .	St
1.7.7	Do n't forget that you must leave space for swapp files , the most the better .	Sug
1.7.8	Then you create a partition for your working data whith enough space for what you think you will need , and one or two larger partitions for the largest files , like images , musics , videos , backups and so on .	St
1.7.9	And you can do so using the two HD .	St
1.7.10	Attention , partition must not be used to substitute the directories tree .	St
1.7.11	Only for efficiency .	St
