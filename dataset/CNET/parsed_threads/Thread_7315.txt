<s> I just recently put a new ati radeon 9200se 128mb PCI video card into my pc. </s>
<s> It did not come with a driver so i went to driverguide.com and got one there. </s>
<s> I tried to install the driver but when it was installing it said could not find card... </s>
<s> The card was in the PCI slot but the VGA cable was not atached. </s>
<s> I then shut down and attached the VGA cable(from the moniter) to the video card and booted up. </s>
<s> The pc boot up but nothing on my screen showed up. </s>
<s> I then plugged the VGA back into its original place and I am now using the mothebroard built in video. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP!!!! </s>
<s> I need to find out how to get the driver installed and the crad to work.! </s>
<s> THanks Billy </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You should've disabled the integrated graphics in BIOs or device manager first. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> how do I disable integrated graphics... will that solve the problem? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Are you sure it's PCI? </s>
<s> My Radeon 9200SE runs on AGP slot. </s>
<s> PCI is just too slow to run any graphic cards. </s>
<s> Just about all mainboard bios automatically disable onboard graphic processors once it detects AGP slot being occupied. </s>
<s> PCI is a different story. </s>
<s> Your computer probably recognized the card as some kind of Multimedia device, but did not realize it is a graphic card. </s>
<s> Just as machine boots up, press Delete key, and look through the menus. </s>
<s> but I thought. </s>
<s> Uninstall all old drivers. </s>
<s> SE means it was a bad chip, something was disables, then downgraded. </s>
<s> It's PCI will it fit in AGP slot?... </s>
<s> Also my computer doesnt reconize it at all when I plug it in and reboot. </s>
<s> Re the &quot;Tip&quot; notice just above the &quot;Subject title:&quot;, asking when you post to include all the necessary info (ie. </s>
<s> operating system, model number, etc...) What is the brand name and model number of your computer? </s>
<s> Also what motherboard or chipset? </s>
<s> If you don't know... can get from Belarc. </s>
<s> Perhaps you may or may not have an AGP slot, and if you do have an AGP slot, you purchased an PCI video card instead of an AGP card. </s>
<s> Radeon 9200SE may not be a good card by today's standard, but it would still be way too fast for a PCI slot. </s>
<s> Are you sure it's PCI? </s>
<s> Both see http://www.ati.com/products/radeon9200/radeon9200/specs.html </s>
<s> Hi, I'm trying to determine if his computer has an AGP slot. </s>
<s> I am aware that the Radeon 9200SE comes in both AGP and PCI versions. </s>
<s> The Radeon 9200SE PCI is definately not too fast or it wouldn't be made. </s>
<s> In fact damasta55r installed one in February. </s>
<s> The highest you can purchase in regular PCI cards at this time is the Radeon 9250, GeForce FX 5500, or GeForce 5700. </s>
<s> I have mentioned this before here . </s>
<s> There is a possiblity that he installed a PCI card in a PCI slot, but has a vacant AGP slot. </s>
<s> I overclocked my AGP Radeon 9200SE to 300Mhz. </s>
<s> Fps does seem to improve noticably. </s>

<s> Wow, you have good memory... Must be nice to be retired and spend all day doing nothing. </s>
<s> Me, i am still in high school. </s>
<s> I don't even have a job. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> at my age. </s>
<s> I'd trade retirement with you for your age. </s>
<s> ;-) When I was in high school my 1st job was a pin setter in a bowling alley, lasted about 3 weeks, then stocker/bagger/carry-out at a grocery store, then a usher at a vehicle drive in theater, for $2 a night and watch all the great movies free. </s>
<s> Saved enough to buy my 1st old Ford vehicle. </s>
<s> My son worked as a fry cook at Taco Bell while in high school. </s>
<s> IT is a PCI card and I do have an AGP slot also... </s>
<s> I got the drivers then had to disable onboard graphics and set the bios to boot from PCI. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help everyone. </s>
<s> If any one knows where I can get a cheap hard drive. </s>
<s> 40 gig minumum ideal atleast 80 gigs? </s>
<s> Thnks Billy </s>
