i have not been a a big fan of the past amd processors.
i have had pentiums.
looking to get a new set up and looking at the large price difference.
reading reports and such make me re think the athlon.
which is better for gaming, videos, mp3's and such.
amd athlon 64 or intel pentium d processor.
i would like to get the most bang for the buck.
the problems i have seen in the past is incompatability with software and the amd.
