Right now a program called SpinRite is checking out the HD from my Win98 machine.
It started developing bad sectors.
The program's price is steep ($89)compare to replacing the drive.
The reviews were good and stated they had been able to recover data.
I don't completely understand but it does things scan disk don't do.
One thing is it isn't dependent on the operating system and will work on PC that have DOS, Win95, Win98, Win XP, OS2 and Linux.
