They *usually* do provide this in explict detail in order for things to go OK. Make sure there is a bios update, for all intends and purposes for an old system like yours and its working just what benefit do you expect to gain? You will the bios flash pgm. the .BIN or actual update file and usually a good clean floppy to install it all from. The instructions will say, how its done. Do not proceed until your ready and when prompted save the old bios info. Make adrn sure you're getting the proper bios update for the Micron model you're doing, don't take anything for granted. good luck -----Willy
