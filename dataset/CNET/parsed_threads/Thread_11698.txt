<s> Hello, I've currently moved into a college dorm, and the internet works fine, but I am having trouble connecting to game servers such as Steam and Gamespy. </s>
<s> Every time I try and refresh, the servers don't show up, and it is giving me the error of &quot;Cannot connect to master game server&quot;. </s>
<s> I know this isn't the most detailed problem, but I thought others might have had this happen, so maybe I'll get some hints at what to do. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for the help. </s>
<s> Some game servers and P2P is blocked. </s>
<s> Ask around to see if others know why. </s>
<s> In closing, it's not a hardware issue. </s>
