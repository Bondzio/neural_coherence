if you really want to get rid of linux the first thing to do is get hold of a win98 startup disk.
insert into floppy drive and boot computer.
at the command prompt c:/ type in c:/fdisk /mbr.
this will get rid of the boot loader for linux and restore you windows loader, then type in exit at command prompt.
remove floppy and reboot computer.
when windows has fully loaded left click on start - all programs - administrative tools - computer management - then disk management in the window that opens showing you disks.
right click on the drive that linux was installed on and click on format.
you have now got rid of linux.
reboot your computer and the drive that was linux should now be a blank drive ready for you to use.
this may seem very simplified but i have not done this for a while and i am writing this from memory.
good luck.
