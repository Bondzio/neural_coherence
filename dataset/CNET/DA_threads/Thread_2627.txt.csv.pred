1.2.1	you could buy an LCD TV/monitor combination , in which case you 'll get a lower quality ( by computer standards ) monitor and a TV OR buy any monitor you want , and a PCI capture card ( around $ 70 ) which allow you to use the PC as a DVR , and you can watch TV whenever you like ( you may have to hook the sattilite box into it , i 'd contact them on it ( i know it should be possible , but i 've never had sat .
