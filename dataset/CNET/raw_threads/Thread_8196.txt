I have a toshiba 51H84C HDTV-CRT, and I was going to hook up my computer to it through DVI converted to HDMI, but then I saw in the manual: Note: This TV should not be used with a PC. Is there any reason why it would state this? Also, could someone explain to me the whole DVI-D and DVI-I thing and which ones would work on a TV? and another thing, I am using an DVD Player through Component (Y, Pb, Pr) and even though I select widescreen for all the settings, it still comes out as 4:3 with those bar things on the top and bottom, is it becuase Component is a analog signal? Also, one more thing... My TV only came with one HDMI port, would this be a problem in the future? Because I plan to get HD Cable and a HD DVD Player, which would require 2 ports, what would I be able to do about this?

If my recollection is correct...you could connect a computer to the tv, except the tv has to on first before the turning on the computer, otherwise the HDMI will not recognize the DVI connection. On the subject of DVI; DVI-I will support both digital and analog signals and DVD-D will only support digital. On the 4:3 thing; are you sure the material you are viewing is wide screen? Other than that, I don't know what to say (tv and dvd got so dawn many adjustments). One HDMI port; Don't know too much about them but I think that may be normal. The whole idea about HDMI is its universal connection..like usb on computer. Hope this help a little. My brain is all tapped out, hehe.

4549	4	96939	1107700	1107309	Art	4/7/05 8:10 PM	1.1129046E12	From what I gether...	You can't tell the difference by looking at the connector, so I guess your best bet would be to consult the manual. It appears that dvi comes in two favor (single link and dual link). Single link is 18 pins and dual link is 24 pins. The dual link is the one that gives you the best graphic. If you are connecting the video card to a dvi port and not to a vga connection then it doesn't matter what you have. That's the best I can do..good searching!
