i have to look (search on the maker's site) for these three software or drivers.
1. the machines chipset driver package (many skip this.)
2. the wifi card drivers.
3. any &quot;helper&quot; app that turns on the wifi.
for dell it's called quickset.
for acer it could be emanage or esomething from memory.
many forget item 1 or 3 and can't get it to turn on.
