Now I have to use the vga port and there is blurriness around text (images look fantastic). Native resolution 1680 x 1050. I have a Nvdia 8600 GT dual DVI card with the latest driver. I'm using the DVI/VGA adapter that came with this card. In XP/SP3, I have changed the smooth edges from ClearType to standard and back again. ClearType looks better than standard, but it is still blurry. Is there a way to get clear text? This is my work computer and 90% of its use is completely text. I was told replacing the DVI port needs microsoldering and it is probably more cost effective to buy a new monitor.

Here's a picture. http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=desktop2.jpg That's connected with VGA and to me is very sharp. Maybe you just need to fix what broke or replace it? Bob

I have to use the Nvidia adapter because my 8600 only has DVI ports. I'm going to get a DVI to VGA cable to see if that completely clears it (fingers crossed). . I don't have the option of changing the refresh from 60.
