hi harv, i have noticed this problem only in the last 4 years.
maxtor never used to be this noisy, and no hard drive should be.
i have had some that last a couple of years but lately they have broke down and destroyed my data.
i have now stopped buying maxtor which is a pity as they used to be one of the best.they are not the worst though.
that goes to fujitsu hard drives they are the worst.
western digital are good and i have had no problems, so it is a safe bet.
so basically i am saying return it for a refund or ask to speak to the manager and tell them you have lost data and wish for an explanation and maybe some kind of insentive for buying them in the future.
good luck
