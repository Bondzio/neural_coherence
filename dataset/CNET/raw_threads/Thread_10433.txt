I am having temperature issues with my pc, as the BIOS is beeping now, and checking my BIOS beeping guide it looks like it's a temperature problem, and I'd like you to show me which is the hardware that is having that overheating. Here you have a screenshot of CPUID: http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/1934/cpuido.png &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This is the temperature for a normal use, I'm just using a virtual machine with Ubuntu, listening to iTunes and browsing with Chrome... &lt;span&gt; My display card currently has no fan or cooling system, yesterday I bought a new fan, and it'll arrive soon. But I don't know, I've seen my display card with temperatures around 75*, and it was not beeping... I'd like to know if there's a problem with something esle. Thanks in advance.

Here I use a laser spot thermometer (the office is full of engineers) and we've swapped a few defective motherboards over this issue. 75C is dang hot. Did you try the old cover off, point a fan at the open case test? And don't laugh, I still meet folk that think heat sink compound is optional. &quot;The metal is touching so that's enough.&quot; Bob
