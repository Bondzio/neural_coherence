I have a second hard drive which is also IDE but is connected to the 1st SATA port using a SATA-&gt;IDE converter. So far, I have had no problems using this system, however recently, my much larger USB external hard drive failed. In looking for a replacement, I was wondering if there would be any problems if I were to use an internal SATA drive for storage as well as the other two drives. I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work, but I thought I'd just check before spending the cash! Cheers

Personally I probably would do it this way; harddrives are so inexpensive now, I would just go and buy another one (lot less problem).
