looks like you found me out.
i am a windows person with fair to above average knowledge of most any windows system or application problems.
my son has a mac g4 running 10.4.11 we have hooked up several printers,(two hp's with direct usb cables.
also hooked up a lexmark 1400 series wireless printer).
g4 finds all the printers and drivers.
it allows us to print test,alignment pages,etc.
however each time we try to print from pages or word for mac,we get error while printing messages and the status goes to stopped printing..
