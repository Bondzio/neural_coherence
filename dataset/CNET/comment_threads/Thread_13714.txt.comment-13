I think it's a hardware issue.
What spare network card is there?
Is there a BIOS &quot;Defaults&quot; in the BIOS Screen?
Why I ask is someone sometime had &quot;locked down&quot; the IRQ assignments and gummed up the works.
They were remembering the bad old days of ISA BUS and needed a little push to PCI.
