<s> I just got a Acomdata external HD enclosure (USB 2.0/Firewire) and I want to hook my main PC to it using the firewire (done sucessfully) and my laptop up to it at the same time using the USB connection. </s>
<s> Can this be done without damaging the unit? </s>
<s> I have successfully plugged it into the laptop with only the USB interface (no connection through firewire at that time). </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice </s>
<s> I would advice an Ethernet hard disk, like the one shown in http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10594 (many others available, this is just an example). </s>
<s> And advantage is that (using a wireless connection to a router from your laptop) it's available wirelessly also. </s>
<s> You might be able to buy just an enclosure, and keep using your current hard disk in it. </s>

<s> This was asked before and responders said &quot;no&quot; as well as why but they tried it and toasted the contents of the drive. </s>
<s> The answer is definitely no. </s>

<s> Is it ok to switch back and forth (periodically like once a week or less) if I want to use it on the main PC with FireWire and then turn it off & hook it up to the laptop with USB, and then off again to use it on the Main PC? </s>
<s> I assume it is, but I was just wondering. </s>
<s> I tried searching for my question before posting and didn't find it...sorry for the repost. </s>
<s> They can be twitchy since they are not damage resistant. </s>
<s> If said volume is NTFS I bet you won't have an issue. </s>
