1.1.1	My hard drive recently stopped working after my laptop took a fall .	St
1.1.2	I replaced the hd with a new one and re-installed the os ( win7 ) So my laptop is up and running again .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the hard part , I used a usb to sata converter for my old hard drive to pull the data off , I 've recovered a good portion of the files now how do I put them to use on my laptop with the new hd ?	Ques
1.1.4	I 've copied the files from the old hd and saved them in a folder already .	St
1.1.5	It 's mostly pics , music , and documents .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	you have a 2.5 & quot ; from the old laptop that allowed you to extract some data .	St
1.2.2	I 'd think you could buy a USB enclosure and put the drive in that and just reconnect it to the laptop .	Sug
1.2.3	But what you did n't tell is what you 've already put the old data on .	St
1.2.4	You might offer that information .	St
1.3.1	I put the old data in a folder on my laptop .	St
1.3.2	I tried to transfer the old files to the new hard drive by copy/paste but I ran into issues because I received an error message that I did n't have & quot ; permissions & quot ; to make any changes .	St
1.3.3	So I created a folder called Toshiba HD and dropped the old files in there .	St
1.3.4	I do n't think I can use the old hard drive as back up storage ( or at least I ca n't afford for a professional to attempt to fix it for me ) or I 'd just buy another hd caddy and make it a salve to the other because there is a second bay to install another hd on my laptop .	St
1.3.5	I 'm basically just trying to get my old documents/settings , pics , and music back on my laptop .	St
1.3.6	Shame on me for not back it up , it 'll NEVER happen again .	St
1.4.1	on the same hard drive ?	Ques
1.4.2	Then you should be able to put the old drive into a USB enclosure and copy out the data from there as long as the drive is still accessible .	St
1.4.3	The other method would have been to use a USB flash drive .	St
1.4.4	Maybe I 'm not seeing the issue properly but it seems to me that copying the data to other media would have been ... and still might be ... the way to go .	St
1.5.1	Right , I was able to copy the data and create a new folder in my library on the new hard drive .	St
1.5.2	The old drive was moderately functional .	St
1.5.3	I just do n't know what to do with the files to get my settings , documents and pics and music back to where it was .	St
1.5.4	The files I copied do n't say my documents or my music ... when I open them it 's like reading a foreign language , that 's the reason I was trying to paste them to my new drive ( c ) but it would n't allow me to do that because I did n't have permission to do so ( still not understanding that one ) .	St
1.5.5	And I do appreciate your input in case I had n't mentioned that before !	Polite
1.6.1	your & quot ; my documents & quot ; folders and sub-folder but just random files from the hard drive , did you ?	Ques
1.6.2	All you really needed was what you created or saved in the way of personal data and not files from programs .	St
1.6.3	Sorry , but I ca n't picture at all what you did now or what the files were .	St
1.6.4	You said the old drive was & quot ; moderately functional & quot ; .	St
1.6.5	Is it possible that it still may be in that condition ?	Ques
1.6.6	If so , a USB enclosure might allow you access to your & quot ; my documents & quot ; folder to just extract what you have deliberately saved .	St
1.6.7	There may also be stuff in the downloads folder if you used the default Windows structure .	St
1.7.1	I 'm going to head over to Microcenter and purchase a USB enclosure , I have the HD in the freezer still so maybe I can fire it up again .	St
1.7.2	I would like to try and take the info from there and put it back on my hard drive .	St
1.7.3	I 'm not too concerned with the drivers and what not , I replaced most of them using the back up cd but my documents , pics , and music are important .	St
1.7.4	When I was copying the data from the old hd , I could n't find any specific folders that had & quot ; my documents & quot ; or & quot ; my music etc .	St
1.7.5	And I had my win7 library set up with about 20 different subfolders as well but I guess I can kiss that all goodbye since I reinstalled the os after I replaced the hard drive .	St
1.7.6	Thank you for all of your help Steven , it is greatly appreciated .	St
