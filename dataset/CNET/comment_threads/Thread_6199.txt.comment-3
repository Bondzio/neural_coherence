Bob, On the same subnet, looking via the telcom's router they are both 172.16.x.x.
Only on a ipconfig do I see a different ip.
However maybe I will just redo the ip's and see if that clears them up.
Also remember I can ping both ip's going both ways.
There is only the 2 machines on the network.
We both know that sometimes ip's get hung up, so maybe that is it.
