hi everyone, i'm recently upgrading my video card on my desktop.
it's the ati radeon hd 2900 xt.
i'm just not sure what is the proper way of hooking power to it.
this is my first video card that needs it's own power to it.
frys electronics is selling this:  .
i'm not sure if i just need one of those.
it's confusing if i need two 6 pin cables, one for the 6 pin connector and one for the 8 pin connector.
i know i'll need an 8 pin for it's connector if i want to overclock and so on.
any help and i thank you.
i just want to get what i need before the card gets here.
