<s> I desperately need a new computer, and it should be suited for AutoCAD, 3D MAx, Photoshop and other graphics software. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any advice? </s>
<s> I have not decided wheter to buy a finished computer, or build one. </s>
<s> I am grateful to any advice. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> can you afford $1400 or only $600? </s>
<s> does your budget include monitor? </s>
<s> do you need multiple monitors? </s>
<s> you need to set a budget and specify the monitor setup you want to use before you can get any good advice. </s>
<s> Well, the main thing is to get a great computer, but of course I would like it as inexpensive as possible I know, however, that I probably have to pay a bit, and I guess more like $1400 than $600. </s>
<s> I do not need anything else than the machine (no monitors or anything). </s>
<s> I am thinking of using Intel Core 2 Quad ..., a MB that fits it and a Graphic card compatible with Open GL and Active X-9 or more (if I decide to build it myself). </s>
<s> I know that different components not always go together, and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together, it would be great to hear about it. </s>
<s> Determine the primary s/w pkg. </s>
<s> you want and then find its requirements. </s>
<s> Using AutoCAD, google for it for results. </s>
<s> I like to refrain from terms like &quot;powerful&quot; it should be more like &quot;capable&quot;. </s>
<s> You don't really need a fast cpu but rather stuffed ram and decent video. </s>
<s> If the s/w takes advantage of &quot;multiple core cpus&quot; then again, it needn't be the fastest but get one that your mtrbd. </s>
<s> fully supports, easily. </s>
<s> As for a mtrbd., pick top-end brands as anything cheap will certainly hurt once the crunching starts. </s>
<s> Of course, be sure the case is well cooled. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> all you need to decide is whether or not you want a &quot;professional&quot; graphics card. </s>
<s> consumer cards will work with most cad/rendering apps, but may have minor incompatilities -- the professional card has been tested and has better drivers to ensure higher precision and compatibility. </s>
<s> you need not worry about &quot;parts that go well together&quot; since all pci-express x16 cards will work in any pc equipped with an x16 slot. </s>
<s> personally, i suggest you start with a mid-range quad core like this $800 gateway lx-6200, phenom x4 9500, 8gb ram, 750gb drive, vista 64bit and add a $100 geforce 9600gt . </s>
<s> the 9600gt will exceed the raw performance of a $450 quadro fx1700. </s>
<s> Call a custom build shop in your area, hopefully you have more than one so you can comparison shop. </s>
<s> Give them your requirements and budget and go from there. </s>
<s> A custom build is usually the preferred way to get your computer for the things your going to do, but hey, give dell a looksee and compare price with the custom shops...(xps series) </s>
<s> Thank you all for advice. </s>
<s> I have had a lot of computers, custom made, ready made and some I have built myself, and the ones I have been most satisfied with are the ones I have built myself. </s>
<s> That can be plain luck, but it can also be because the ones one can buy in the shop if one have a budget, are often not the latest, but maybe 6 month old machines. </s>
<s> If one will have the latest in parts, the machines will be very expensive (Norway is one of the most expensive country to buy stuff in, thanks to horribly high taxes). </s>
<s> And that is why I am considering building a new computer myself. </s>
<s> I appreciate all the tips and advices I have got so far, and will start looking for parts Thanks. </s>
