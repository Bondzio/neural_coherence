According to your post Dell claims that the H/D is failing.
On boot attempt no H/D was found.
Provided that all connections are correct your drive is DEAD.
On a slim chance that the drive will spin up for your data recovery I posted the proceedure I use.
This is a 50/50 chance of recovery.
The more you attempt to use the bad H/D your data recovey decreases.
Bill Comments anyone?
