Uh, I believe that the motherboard is SATA-II and therefore as I've said, the SATA ports work just fine :P I think you wouldn't be able to fix it in ten minutes xD Yes, again, I said the CD drive is set to master.
As well It means, I've taken apart and rebuilt already built computers hundreds of times.
But I've never purchased a mobo and all the parts and put them together and installed everything.
I think you're starting to sound arrogant.
It's not appreciated.
