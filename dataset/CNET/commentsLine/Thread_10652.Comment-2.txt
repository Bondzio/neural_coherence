make firewire connected hard disks reliable.
some will write it works but given how many i see each year (almost equal to usb drives) and that we had firsthand experience of total wipeouts for no good reason i'll write &quot;don't.&quot; feel free to try but don't store anything that you can't lose on them.
then again, when i connect to an apple, we'll go firewire everytime.
&quot;can i hook up this drive to two computers (running winxp and win 2003) at the same time with firewire?
will both windows recognize them (will it handle priorities etc)?&quot; absolutely not.
