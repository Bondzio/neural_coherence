So I ordered the Sound Blaster Audigy 2 to replace my onboard Realtek AC97.
My question is, can I just uninstall it from my Device Manager??.....
because I heard you had to do it through the BIOS which is something I've never tinkered with.
Also, if I uninstall it through Device Manager, will it kep trying to reinstall itself through windows detecting it?
Thanks for any help
