I read more of the PCLinuxOS user's guide and decided I'd better try a safeboot.
There were a few reports of this or that not found, but nothing seemed fatal.
Then it displayed some text that began with something like &quot;Loading GUI... (and another paragraph of text that disappeared too fast to read)&quot;, then it went into the Grey Screen of Death (i.e., nothing but a blank grey screen).
