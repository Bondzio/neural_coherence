Get what your mobo support.
Some memory can be touchy.
You can buy 433Mhz DDR2 in 1GB sticks.
Good choice to max it out.
Your Video card choice is also a good upgrade, especially at 256.
Some will argue for ATI.
Consider a good replacement P/S if the Dell shows any age/wear but their supplies are better than the watts shown.
But a really good supply is a positive upgrade to consider.
Past that a new Mobo and a Core Duo would be next and what you buy now will be usable.
