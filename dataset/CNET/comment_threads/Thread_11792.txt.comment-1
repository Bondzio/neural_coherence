I'm looking to buy a new graphics card for my IXTREME 6052 PC, but I'm not sure which one to get, I've noticed this one online: http://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/129398/art/pny/geforce-6200-agp-8x-256-m.html A GeForce 6200 card But I'm not sure that this will be compatible with my system, can someone confirm for me that it is, or recommend another card?
