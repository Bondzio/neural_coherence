<s> It use to work under XP. </s>
<s> Ok I wasn't able to burn CDR's with it any more. </s>
<s> But it read CD's fine. </s>
<s> But just recently I go to install a game but find the CD rom is missing. </s>
<s> So I go into device manager, its listed but as disabled. </s>
<s> Well the device usage option is set ''enabled''. </s>
<s> But device status says ''This device is disabled. </s>
<s> (Code 22) Click Enable Device to enable this device.'' </s>
<s> When I do so it simple states ''Windows was not able to enable this device'' It does show up under win98 which I have duel boot. </s>
<s> This CD RW has never needed a specific driver for it. </s>
<s> Regardless I did do a search for drivers and came up empty. </s>
<s> All driver searches lead me to firmware update. </s>
<s> Which I'm reluctant to install when I'm not sure I need it (worked before under default firmware) and when I don't know how to find out my current firmware. </s>
<s> I can't think of anything else. </s>
<s> I haven't made any changes to speak of to my system (other then installing a sound card that only runs under win98 because it has no XP drivers, but that was some time ago and I'm pretty sure I remembered my CD rom working after that under XP) this is very peculiar. </s>
<s> I find this happens when XP is installed, but the person installing XP is unaware about motherboard drivers. </s>
<s> Many are just discovering that Microsoft does not do this for us as well as we should avoid any driver offered by Windows Update. </s>
<s> You didn't write about the machine so I can't offer what driver package I'd try. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Boot XP and remove the CDROM in the device manager. </s>
<s> On reboot XP will add it back in. </s>
<s> If it's a simple issue that may do the trick. </s>

<s> I already installed MoBo drivers. </s>
<s> Thanks (removing and readding the cdrom drive) sotra worked but.. Planescape torment... when i got to a new area it wants the CD, even though the CD's in there. </s>
<s> I don't have this trouble under win98. </s>
<s> Other times with other programs it sometimes has trouble 'seeing' the CD under XP but not win98. </s>
<s> MoBo GA-71XE thunderbird athlon 750. </s>
<s> The CD that came with is likely out of date. </s>
<s> I'd hit the motherboard maker's web site for latest. </s>
<s> I can write with authority that Microsoft and the Update Driver will not do the trick. </s>
<s> Also, you may need better CDRW recording software. </s>
<s> Windows XP's native recording is so-so about all drives. </s>
