I have an HP Pavilion ze5185 notebook computer with 2.1 Ghz Pentium 4 processor, 512 MB RAM, 60 GB hard disk drive, and the networking is built into the board. I am using wired networking. I am running Windows XP Home Edition with SP2. The router is a Dlink DI 604. When I put my computer in standby mode and come back a few minutes or couple of hours later, networking isn't working. I can't make a connection to the Internet. I have to log off and log back on to restore access to my network or the Internet. And, I usually run the computer in a limited account for security reasons, so I can't disable the network connection and re-enable it, or repair it, because I don't have admin access. If anyone knows what the problem is, I would appreciate knowing what to do. Is there a program that can help me with these connectivity problems and re-establishing network/internet connectivity when having these problems? Thanks

Sometimes a motherboard BIOS update that fixes this is available. I did run into a wireless-g network adapter that exhibited this behaviour and was able to fix it by installing a newer firmware version. Note that not all adapters have upgradable firmware. Check to see if there is newer driver to download for the adapter. Sometimes there is a network adapter setting that allows the computer to turn off the device to save power. Try turning this feature OFF.

I use StandBy ALL the time - except for restarting once a week or so - I close the notebook cover and it goes in to StandBy. Open it, and it is back on - Quickly. . I used to use Hibernate, but StandBy leaves the electronics warm - better than cooling down and heating up frequently. The hard drive is off (maybe good, maybe not so good.) And, it comes back to life very quickly. . I think that Hibernate makes much more use of the HardDrive, and I know that it takes MUCH longer to re-start. . Does anyone know of good reasons NOT to use StandBy regularly ?? . {Note: Win-XP-Home, Toshiba Notebook, Celeron 2.4; 512MB; 45 to 55 applications open at once almost always. } . -eom- .
