<s> I have an internet connection that enters my house using a CAT5 cable through RJ45 type socket - Currently I have a desktop that is connected to the Cable - I want to share my internet connection - The desktop should have a cable connection and want to connect a laptop as well which will connect using wireless as well as cable as and when required - I will not be using both computers at all times so do not want to make my desktop a server or the laptop a server - So how do i share the connection - I mean do i use a wireless router, switch or something else ? </s>
<s> and then how do I set it up - I have no experience or education in networking so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me in detail. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Normally you will connect the router to that source (usually a modem). </s>
<s> The router will then do its thing, wired and wireless. </s>
<s> After the router is in place you turn on File and Printer Sharing on each PC, but only if you want to share files and such between the two PCs. </s>
<s> No &quot;server&quot; settings are involved. </s>
<s> Again, the source is important. </s>
<s> If you get your service from another router, the above setup can be daunting. </s>
<s> Okay I checked my wiring and here is how it shows - RJ11 wire connects to Modem which is a billin modem - the router interface is inaccessible, then from the modem an RJ45 cable connects to my computer - evertime i connect to my ISP i am first taken to a login page and once I enter the username and password i get an always on connection unless the connection is idle for more than 24 hrs - I get a default gateway and IP address of 124.125.xxx.xxx - not sure if it is a static or a dynamic IP allocatin - I can check for a few days and let you know to be sure - My ISP is very forthcoming with the fact that they will not assist in setting up 3rd party routers. </s>
<s> They will also not give any info to help with the same - so basically i need a solution that will allow me to share the internet irrespective of modem settings. </s>
<s> I receive an always on internet connection from my RJ45 cable and I just need help so that the signal can be shared on one wired and then wireless connection. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Putting a router between the modem and your PC's should be solution. </s>
<s> They come with instruction to set them up. </s>
<s> For wired connection all goes automatically. </s>
<s> For wireless the usuals are SSID, channel, encryption type and password. </s>
<s> You don't need the ISP for any of those. </s>
