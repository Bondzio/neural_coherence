I think I found the problem, after doing some research I discovered that the D975XBX2 Motherboard doesn't support the E6750 Processor because it uses a 1333 MHz FSB but the motherboard only supports 1066 or 800 MHz.
So the E6700 should work but I think I'm going to get the Q6600 because it's cheaper on Amazon and the motherboard supports it.
