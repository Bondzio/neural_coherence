1.1.1	Hello , We have been recording ( voice and music ) on 90 mins tape for the last 12 years .	St
1.1.2	I am looking to create a digital library ( covert all those tapes on MP3 ) .	St
1.1.3	I am wondering on wich support to keep that library .	St
1.1.4	One hard drive a year and a copy on another location .	St
1.1.5	Copy the MP3 on a DVD .	St
1.1.6	Copy the MP3 on DSS ( DAT ) tape .	St
1.1.7	What is the life expentency of each support .	St
1.1.8	My first idea was to store on Hard Drive but last week I dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke ( I had almost had everything on backup but I lost a month of recording ) .	St
1.1.9	So now I am unsure how I should procede .	St
1.2.1	Just discussed at http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html ? forumID=6 & threadID=185344 & messageID=2017489 Your comment of & quot ; My first idea was to store on Hard Drive but last week I dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke ( I had almost had everything on backup but I lost a month of recording ) .	St
1.2.2	So now I am unsure how I should procede. & quot ; is telling me you do n't have a backup system .	St
1.2.3	Or even a second copy .	St
1.2.4	No matter which system you used , without a second copy none will satisfactory .	St
1.2.5	& quot ; I am wondering on wich support to keep that library. & quot ; Before I comment further , said library must have a backup system .	St
1.2.6	& quot ; One hard drive a year and a copy on another location. & quot ; Seems to be OK .	St
1.2.7	When one fails you toss it , get new and clone the copy again .	St
1.2.8	CHEAP , big storage .	St
1.2.9	Pretty fast but no write protection means that if the user errored or some virus did it in that the same fate awaits the second copy .	St
1.2.10	Where 's the write protection ?	Ques
1.2.11	& quot ; Copy the MP3 on a DVD. & quot ; Here 's the care , handling document : http : //www.itl.nist.gov/div895/carefordisc/ Here 's the lifespan document : http : //hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl ? sid=05/02/05/0024258 & quot ; Copy the MP3 on DSS ( DAT ) tape. & quot ; The only downside here is that DAT tape and readers are not widely available .	St
1.2.12	It 's not something I 'd consider today .	St

1.3.1	herald_thomas writes , If you have a computer , then you can add an internal hard drive to store the music files .	St
1.3.2	Please change the file permissons for it .	St
1.3.3	Step 1 : Set Permissions ========================== 1 ) Click Start , point to Programs , point to Accessories , and then click Windows Explorer .	St
1.3.4	2 ) Locate the file or folder for which you want to set permissions .	St
1.3.5	3 ) Right-click the file or folder , click Properties , and then click the Security tab .	St
1.3.6	4 ) Click the name of the group or user .	St
1.3.7	5 ) In Permissions , click Allow for each permission you want to allow .	St
1.3.8	further you may also give it read-only rights , so that no one else deletes it .	St
1.3.9	Step 1 : Rread-only ========================== 1 ) Click Start , point to Programs , point to Accessories , and then click Windows Explorer .	St
1.3.10	2 ) Locate the file or folder for which you want to remove read-only .	St
1.3.11	3 ) Right-click the file or folder , click Properties , and then click the General tab .	St
1.3.12	4 ) Ccheck the options & quot ; Read-only & quot ; Now you have stored the files , but we should always maintain a back-up of all our important files .	St
1.3.13	To maintain backup , I would suggest you to write the contents to a CD .	St
1.3.14	CDs are more durable than DVDs .	St
1.3.15	However DVDs hold much more data .	St
