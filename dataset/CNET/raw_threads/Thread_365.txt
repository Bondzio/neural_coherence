I have an Asus P4C800 Deluxe Motherboard, with a Intel 3.0 Gig Hz possessor, 1Gig or ram, two WD HD 250Gig and 80Gig, Nvida 6800 AGP Video card, Sound blaster Audigy 2ZS Platinum, 480 watt power supply and Windows Xp Pro. Boy was it fun to build and it works great. My question is I have two CD/RW drives (one is a DVD/CD/RW) and I can only record on one of the, not both. If I right click on one drive and click properties and and enable &quot;redording on this this cd drive&quot;, the other drive becomes unabled. Is there a way around this. I also have Nero 6 installed __________________ Don

XP might, but I find it's support strewn with problems which I have found no cures. But let me share this site first! http://aumha.org/win5/a/xpcd.php Before you write Nero does such, I beg to differ. InCD might provide it and is bundled with Nero 6. Issues multiple if you use that, but do try on your own dime and take this one advice.... Try it with the IMAPI SERVICE disabled and enabled. What's that you ask? Read the supplied link. Bob
