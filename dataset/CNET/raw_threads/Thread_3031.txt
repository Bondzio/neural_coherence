I have a small hard drive in my laptop, so I keep most of my information on this drive. I'd like to share it off of my desktop computer so I can access my files from anywhere in my house, but don't want the rest of my family messing with my drive. Is there a free program to secure the drive, or even a Windows utility? I'm running Windows XP Home SP2 on the desktop and laptop. Thanks for your help! Nick
