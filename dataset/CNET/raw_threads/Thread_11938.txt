When I changed the RAM to the new one, the windows immediately recognized it and at the control panel/system its shows OK. But, when I'm using the computer like I did in the past, I don't see any changes (not with speed and not with functionality). Do you have any suggestions for me ? Please send and answer. Thank you very much, & Regards, SARA

Unless you're trying to decode the human genome. Usually, it's to improve bragging rights. Not that you did of course, but Windows is really pretty good at allocating RAM and its use. I have four machines with only one Gig of RAM. Any more, in my case, is wasted.

If there is a lot of swapping going on then more ram might be of help. If there is not much swapping going on then adding ram might be of limited value. If you feel the machine is slow and there is not much swapping then the bottleneck is in some other area.

I was lucky a few years ago to have 2 identical machines right down to the same make/model of everything. We had a DVD rendering job that took 6 HOURS. The test runs were made and then the machine's ram sticks were switched and the test rerun. Both machines ran XP. The machine with 1GB finished the 6 hour task ahead of the 512MB machine by 5 or 6 minutes. Bob

If you run one program at a time or programs that don't need much RAM...more RAM doesn't make a noticeable difference. Had you started with 256MBs RAM...you would have seen a greater difference. If you upgrade or switch to Vista....2GB RAM becomes the new user standard. If you go to tomshardware.com, you should be able to find an article saying essentially the same. I'm sure there other similar articles or reviews. Hope this clarifies. VAPCMD
