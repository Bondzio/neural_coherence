1.1.1	Hi , im having problems with the installation of Audigy Card Drviers/software .	St
1.1.2	im running Windows XP , so when i reboot the pooter , after i put the card in , it installs the drivers automatically..	St
1.1.3	In the case of this sound card this is dumb , because , anyone who has used this before will know that you can install the software , players AND drivers from the CD .	St
1.1.4	Now , i had installed the drivers on their own using XP , but then i found about the stuff i said above .	St
1.1.5	upon doing this , i find that all sound ceases to play .	St
1.1.6	This is very fustrating , as i would assume that the installation from the CD and all that would make the sound work even better .	St
1.1.7	Im asking here first , because this is a forum , and Creative Tech Support probably wont help .	St
1.1.8	All i want is my sound , but i want to have it , with all the Creative software installed .	St
1.1.9	someone please help ! ! !	Sug
1.1.10	( P.S Merry Christmas ! )	St
1.1.11	thanks -John	Polite
1.2.1	I found the CD that came with my Audigy to be outdated .	St
1.2.2	I found newer drivers at www.soundblaster.com There is some issue with SBLive/Audigys and some VIA based boards .	St
1.2.3	Usually you can move the card to another slot and that clears it up IF you 've loaded the most recent motherboard drivers .	St
1.2.4	I have n't noted any big issue about XP installing it 's stock drivers and then installing newer .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	From wat your letter says , I understand that windows installs it 's own drivers for the card .	St
1.3.2	What you could try is letting Windows do its thing and then , open your Agui 's Properties from the Divice manager , and cilick on the drivers tab then on Update drivers and choose & quot ; I will select the drivers to be installed , & quot ; then install the proper ones .	Sug
