the toshiba bluetooth managaer says it is only a 30 day trial.
so yes, the drivers will still work after 30 days, but how do i transfer files without a manager/file transfer app?
i must be missing something... all i want to do i transfer files between my cell phone.
i'm thinking the usb cord is faster and more efficient...
