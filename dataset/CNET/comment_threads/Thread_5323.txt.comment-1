Just purchased a Lexar USB 2.0 256MB JumpDrive.
Anyone know of a password protection program (FREE would be ok also), that can be installed on the USB JumpDrive to proctect data?
I want something that can be installed on the JumpDrive itself so there's no need to install a program on every computer the drive is used on, that would not be a practical option for me.
