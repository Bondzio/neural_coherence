yes!
mine was a result of my own carelessness.
i did two &quot;updates&quot; for two differant programs: windows xp and a spyware program.
both required a reboot to finish installing the program.
when i rebooted i got to the &quot;loading windows&quot; screen and never progressed past that.
it would not boot in safe mode either.
nothing i tried worked.
i finally took it to my tech and he had to reinstall windows over the old one ... twice.
most of my programs and data were unharmed, however, there were some programs i had to reinstall and there is at least one program (which i used a lot) which i can not access even after reinstalling it ... twice.
the lesson learned: update only one program at a time, especially if there is a possibility of a reboot to complete the installation!
