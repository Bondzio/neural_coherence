<s> How can I tell if my internal hard drive is set up for NTSF or FAT filing system? </s>
<s> I just bought an external hard drive, and it is recommended that I format the external drive the same as the internal one. </s>
<s> But, for the life of me, I can't find where it indicates type of file system. </s>
<s> I notice it mentioned in disk Defragmenter.I quite sure it's mentioned else where. </s>
<s> click start, my computer, R-click the C: drive and select properties. </s>
<s> Ok, that was too easy. </s>
<s> I found it - NTSF. </s>
<s> I knew I had seen it somewhere but drew a blank as to where and started looking in hardware profiles, etc., etc. </s>
<s> Guess I was making it more complicated than it needed to be. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
