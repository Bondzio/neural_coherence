this d-link di-624 router is driving me nuts.
it disconects and reconects after 10 minutes or so of being solidly connected at 54mbs.
right now it is actually disconnected.
now it came back up the bars in my task bar are green and connected while the disconnected wireless network has a cross in it.
how can one thing say it is connected while the other contradicts it?
if i disable windows firewall it connects to the network, only to disconnect a while later.
if i enable windows firewall the same thing happens.
everything is contradicting something else.
i have reseted the router a couple of times to its factory default but the same things happen again.
it was working fine last night.
my lan is working with no problems.
i have had this router for a week now and i wish i had not bought it.
