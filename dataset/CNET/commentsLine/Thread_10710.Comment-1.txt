hey, i have a fairly great computer with a gtx660 and a i7 3770, but lately one monitor just seems too little, so im upgrading my gpu to a gtx 690 and adding a few monitors to my setup.
but of course like any sensable person, i want to be sure that if i put in a 690 it wont **** everything up with bottlenecking my cpu, so is a i7 3770 capable of keeping up with gtx 690?
