<s> My 3 year old emach is dead. </s>
<s> When I turn it on hard drive access light stays on, power supply fan runs, small fan on heatsink does not, ( will turn freeley by hand.) </s>
<s> I liked my old emach,so I purchased a new one model T5010. </s>
<s> I do not want to donate or give my old one away as it has a lot of personal info on hard drive. </s>
<s> I can not transfer the info to my new one as it has a sticker on the cover that if broken voids the warranty. </s>
<s> Should I take the hard drive,cd, and two 256 merory sticks out and throw the rest in the trash. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> All you have to do is take out the hdd of the old computer, and use a kit to make it a usb hdd case. </s>
<s> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=6991605&type=product&id=1099392683637 After you transfer your important files, I'd format it and use it as a back up drive, or wipe it with any free programs (like bcwipe) and dispose of it. </s>
<s> I have an old system with spyware, but I still want to use it. </s>
<s> You can take the memory and add it to your surrent computer (given it's the right format), you can build a totally new machine with your parts. </s>
<s> Get a new motherboard, a new case, and use the parts in your dead emach like hdd, memory, optical drive, and before you know it, you have a brand new computer. </s>
<s> What everyone forgot to mention here was the fact that emachies has a shutdown temp control in the bios and if your cpu gets to hot, it won't boot or function. </s>
<s> Replace the cpu fan for fifteen\twenty bucks, it will recognize the fan is going, temp down and it may run again. </s>
<s> I own one so I know, replaced my fan, had SAME problem. </s>
<s> There is a chance the cpu is dead but I would try it. </s>
<s> Good luck, Paul </s>
