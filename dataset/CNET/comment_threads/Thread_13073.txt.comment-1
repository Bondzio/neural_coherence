Hi, I just received my new ph and wanted to add an 80GB hdd to it.
My question concerns the drive, I got it at a yard sale, and was wondering if there was a way to make sure that it didn't contain viruses.
Will formatting it in the ph erase any potentially harmful material or do I risk infecting just by hooking it up?
Thanks.
