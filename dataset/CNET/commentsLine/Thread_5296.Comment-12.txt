i would not go with integrated graphics unless absolutely necessary.
many of the newest games require 1 gb of graphic memory.
if you think you are going to want to play games, go with a graphic card that has 1 gb.
or better.
some avid gamers run two or four cards in the same computer!
you don't have to have the latest greatest card either.
it should not cost you a whole lot more to get a desktop with a pci express graphic card.
