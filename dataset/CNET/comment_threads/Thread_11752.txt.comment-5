don't know about HP but definitly DO NOT BUY the Vaio.
just bought 620 G Modell and three weeks later nothing goes ,harddisk crash.Sony struggeld to repair until i threatend with Consumer Help Group.Now i wait almost week to fix it.Not to mention the lost Data so do good research in this times where the companys just want your cash without service.
Tobis also has a &quot;cheap&quot; Software Pack
