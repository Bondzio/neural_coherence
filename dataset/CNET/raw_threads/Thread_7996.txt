My computer has an 80 gig hardrive in it, partitioned into 62.5 and 17.5 gigs worth of unallocated space (the result of getting rid of a linux partition). Now I'd like to be able to use that 17.5 gigs to store files on, but I don't want to pay for Partition Magic or any other similar programs. Are there any working free methods out there, and should I format it to FAT or NTFS?

Of course, a reformat and install would return it to 1 partition. But you would need to back up everything to another source that you didn't want to lose. And make sure you have ALL drivers needed. chuck
