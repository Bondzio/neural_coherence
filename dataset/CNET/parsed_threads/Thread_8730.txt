<s> I'm wondering if any one knows if it is possible to convert a straight through to a crossover cable. </s>
<s> I looked up making your own but I just need to convert one I already have, also all the guides I looked at for making your own said you need a crimping tool which i do not have. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appreciated. </s>

<s> are a dime a dozen almost everywhere. </s>
<s> Cheaper than buying a crimping tool. </s>
