1.1.1	I 'm just curious as to why Sony or Microsoft have n't done a thing to market their own version of an iPad ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 'm not anti-Apple but I have either Sony computers/TV 's or Microsoft 's Zune and their Zune Pass .	St
1.1.3	I do n't want to reinvent my own personal wheel by dumping all my music and Sony cards just to buy an iPad .	St
1.1.4	Yeah , I checked the web and all I got was chatter on how & quot ; companies are looking into it & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	I do n't want to be on Social Security before this happens .	St
1.2.1	Has been the problem .	St
1.2.2	HP was going to release a very nice 11 & quot ; tablet with lots of USB ports + more that would run on Window7 Pro but after testing they found out that Win7 was just not 100 % ready to run a tablet & they are now looking into Android O/S , so that has been push back to late Fall of this year , that is if testing goes good .	St
1.2.3	No one is going to make a dent into iPad sales until someone can make a tablet that runs on Windows 7 Pro or Ultiment with out problems , with good battery life & a competitive price to the iPad but by then the iPad gen 2 will be out , maybe even iPad gen 3 .	St
1.2.4	It is going to be sometime .	St
1.2.5	Dell has their little 5 & quot ; Andrioid thing , I do not consider it a tablet ... just too small , more for a phone size then tablet .	St
1.3.1	Thank you for taking the time to answer my honest question .	St
1.3.2	I am NOT anti-Apple , I simply have a vast and expen $ ive support system of Sony items and love the Microsoft programs .	St
1.3.3	Every time that I see the iPad on TV , I covet it .	St
1.3.4	But I know that as soon as it 's out of the box , I will regret the limiting nature for myself .	St
1.3.5	Being a Zune Pass holder , I 've become used to the luxury of downloading 100 's and 100 's of songs for a flat monthly fee .	St
1.3.6	I 'm fickle , musically , so I have NO desire to OWN the latest *pop* and hip-hop music that I exercise with ; I want NEW each month to hold my interest and motivate me to keep fit .	St
1.3.7	I also have the original Sony e-Reader with 235 books that I paid for and do n't want to lose ; if Sony came out with an & quot ; i-Tab & quot ; ( & lt ; what the iPad SHOULD have been called ) , I could transfer all my books to that device plus use my Memory Sticks .	St
1.3.8	Well , I thank you for taking your time to answer me and not dismiss my curiosity .	Polite
1.3.9	Have a great , glitch-free day !	St
1.4.1	the iPad is selling because of the marketing , not because of the product .	St
1.4.2	it 's little more than an overgrown iPod Touch .	St
1.4.3	it 's a toy and people will buy it because Steve Jobs comes out and hypnotizes them with a black turtleneck .	St
1.4.4	saying , & quot ; oooh look , we are going to sell you a technology that we came up with 4 years ago .	St
1.4.5	it does n't do anything too useful , but you WILL buy it my zombies , yes you will.. & quot ;	St
1.5.1	Windows , Icons , Mouse , Pointer or WIMP is their choice of interfaces .	St
1.5.2	As we move to tablets you may have to change .	St
1.5.3	Change is hard for big companies .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	There is competition out there .	St
1.6.2	It 's just not marketed as well .	St
1.6.3	the answer is really that there 's not enough of a demand for such devices .	St
1.6.4	the real question is why is there an iPad to begin with ?	Ques
1.6.5	It does n't have enough functionality and it does n't fit a need .	St
1.6.6	it may as well be called the iFad .	St
1.7.1	So , are netbooks and their cheapness and tiny size stealing the potential tablet audience ?	Ques
1.7.2	I have a netbook but the keyboard is SO small that I keep making typing mistakes all the time .	St
1.7.3	I love the fact that you can get apps for tablets and their large screen which is also a keyboard .	St
1.7.4	~sigh~ I guess in a years time , if there 's no competition , I 'll break down and buy an iPad .	St
1.8.1	I agreed to begin with about the non-functionality of the iPad , but now that I 've had time use my iPad , I have a different opinion .	St
1.8.2	The functionality of a Netbook or Laptop is based on using Office and programs like that .	St
1.8.3	But there are many people use their Netbooks to get email , surf the web , do some basic productivity work , etc , but may not use the device for hard-core productivity and office-related duties .	St
1.8.4	Of course there are many people who do use their Laptops for hard-core purposes too , but many people simply use the devices for casual use .	St
1.8.5	At work , many people are using iPads , and with the Wi-Fi and using programs like EverNote , we can send eachother updates on meeting notes , updated To-Do lists , etc .	St
1.8.6	It 's a great way to connect with other people here at work when everyone is in different areas , and it beats a pager or trying to call everyone on their cell phone inside our building .	St
1.8.7	The iPad is a great device for the casual user but it does have productivity apps too .	St
1.8.8	It 's a fun , easy device that has more entertainment value than anything else , but it does have enough productivity apps that do make it useful .	St
1.8.9	Of course , the iPad is based primarily on receivng and sending via wireless .	St
1.8.10	No DVD drive , no USB connections unless you get adapters .	St
1.8.11	Look at it this way : There are millions of people using their Smart Phones for web surfing , watching movies , downloading music , etc .	St
1.8.12	Should we complain about phones because they are n't productive devices ?	Ques
1.8.13	Until you spend time with an iPad , I do n't think the true value becomes evident .	St
1.9.1	Nice post , Dan .	St
1.9.2	See , I would use an iPad-like device BECAUSE of the & quot ; Fun Factor & quot ; .	St
1.9.3	I do my & quot ; serious & quot ; work on my 17 & quot ; laptop .	St
1.9.4	Only reason I 'm not buying an iPad is I do n't have any Apple products and do n't want to convert from Sony and Microsoft , which is what I 've got a boatload of items invested in .	St
1.9.5	But , I love your positive post .	St
1.9.6	Thank you .	St
1.10.1	there is actually a lot of devices that has been made to compete with Ipad .	St
1.10.2	One of this is the known Witstech AI8E .	St
1.10.3	This device has a lot of things to offer with full specification which Ipad does n't have .	St
1.10.4	There is a lot of Android Tablet as well that are trying to compete with Ipad .	St
1.10.5	Its just that Apple has the best marketing exposure compared to them , which no one can beat .	St
1.11.1	Well , I guess waiting has paid off .	St
1.11.2	I just read at cnet about the Samsung Galaxy that is coming out ?	Ques
1.11.3	and priced ?	Ques
1.11.4	I like the Flash capabilities , the camera and also the smaller size .	St
1.11.5	My e-reader is the same profile and it 's super lightweight and easy-peasy to carry around .	St
1.11.6	I 'll check out the other two manufacturers that you suggested , too .	St
1.12.1	In my opinion , since the NVIDIA has released tegra2 processor after , tablet pc will enter a new era .	St
1.12.2	Zpad used Tegra2 processors , 1GHz speed , 1GB memory , android2.2 system .	St
1.12.3	wifi , 3G , 130 million pixel camera .	St
1.12.4	This configuration may be able to compete with the ipad .	St
1.12.5	At least , you can share .	St
