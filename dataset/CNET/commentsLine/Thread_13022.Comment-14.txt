radioactive1 is right.
antennas dont generate power but they certainly transfert power.
one antenna could be so weak and lot of loss in the signal power, whereas one antenna so be so high quality and good to transfer most of the power with minimal loss.
that is why antennas are measured in gain... remember cheap small antennas only peak a few beams therefore low signal and low gain, bigger antennas would pick up lots os signal so it would have the best coverage and best performance and receive signal with higher gain... put it this way, put your pc in a corner with desk and lots of things around it, wires, cables etc etc...maybe a blanket....if you notice your reception is so poor and your internet is a bit slower... because you blocking the signals and very less and minimus signal is received by the antenna.... more signal the antenna receives, more gain and more performance, quicker internet connection or shall i say wifi connection...
