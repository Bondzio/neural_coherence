i use an hp computer and my os is win xp.
i get 10mbps download from my isp and it's up to speed.
i have disconnected the modem electrically and also reset it to no avail.
i did this with a tech from my isp.
i read a lot of business articles on cnbc.
my computer downloads a printed page, then freezes and the print disappears leaving me a totally white page.
after 5 seconds the printed page reappears and the mouse wheel becomes operational about 5 seconds after that.
this also happens when i download some page from the internet that is not a page of print.
that is, the system just seems to freeze and then after a few seconds i can navagate in the page with my mouse.
is this a buffering problem?
could the problem be with my os, win xp?
any help to cure this greatfully appreciated.
