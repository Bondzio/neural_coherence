1.1.1	I have a Sony DRU-720A DVD/CD rewritable drive and I want to attach it to a P5AD2-E Deluxe via ATAPI (EIDE).	St
1.1.2	Can I use the PRI_RAID1 on the ASUS Mobo??	St
1.1.3	How should the BIOS setings be configured?	St
1.2.1	Typically, RAID controllers do not support ATAPI devices.	St
1.2.2	I have 3 ASUS boards but not your model and mine all have RAID 0 and 1 capabilities.	St
1.2.3	These controllers can be configured as regular IDE for HDs but not ATAPI devices.	St
1.2.4	Your board should have come with a manual.	St
1.2.5	If not, the ASUS web site is good about having these available on line so you can double check but I would say the answer is &quot;no&quot;.	St
1.3.1	Nope, that's not the primary purpose of the raid connectors.	St
1.3.2	You have to use the either the primary/secondary EIDE ports, not the raid ports.	St
1.3.3	Unless, it is configuarble, then maybe and that's a big maybe.	St
1.3.4	Your bios setting should explained in the manual or support website thier usage of all IDE ports.	St
1.3.5	If you have 4 ide devices already installed, then consider what has to be swapped or gone in order to use your new drive.	St
1.3.6	If you have small HDs, now is the time for a larger HD to complish the same mbs is not more.	St
1.3.7	sorry... tada -----Willy	St
