Canon Black #5 - 26ml of ink for roughly $16.25 HP Black #94 - 11ml of ink for roughly $19.99 If you look at the colors, the HP color, if one runs out then you replace all three regardless. The Canon, you just replace the color that is out. The guys over at www.----------.com know what they are talking about. They did a price anaylsis for my office (I just emailed them the printers we use and where we buy our cartridges from), and after seeing some of the cost of our printers, I swapped out three of them in two weeks. Just remember the cost of the cartridges is what it really cost the company.&quot;
