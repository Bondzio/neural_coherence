<s> Hi all I facing an irritating problem for the last few days.... </s>
<s> I m using my office network, the printer is installed on a desktop, all my colleagues can acces it, but when I try I can't. </s>
<s> I can even ping the computer but can not access the shared resources on it.... a message appears when i try to access the IP &quot; No network provider can accept the given path&quot; I m unable to access even my own PC and the above mentioned message appears. </s>
<s> My firewall is off. </s>
<s> Let's hope your IT and network guys understand the links from http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;No+network+provider+accepted+the+given+network+path&quot; . </s>
<s> It's a slightly different error message (&quot;accepted&quot; in stead of &quot;can accept&quot;), but that might not be a problem. </s>

<s> Since this is an office environment your first step would be to see what your IT Department has to say. </s>
<s> If they experience difficulty, then may be the article below will help; http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=841570 I wasn't sure I understood your last sentence, you are &quot;unable to access even my own PC and the above mentioned message appears&quot;. </s>
<s> Access your computer from where? </s>

<s> Ideally when u access your computer by putting ur own IP in RUN, then it shows ur shared folders and printers etc. </s>
<s> but in my case when i put my own IP it returns the same message as in the case of another computers. </s>
<s> i hope u understand what i mean. </s>
