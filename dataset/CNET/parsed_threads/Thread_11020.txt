<s> I have a P4 2.4 Ghz (800 Mhz FSB, HT) with 1 GB of RAM, and 8xAGP. </s>
<s> I currently have an nVidia GeForce FX 5200 video card with 128 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> The card is decent, but I notice it slowed down on some of the newer games I have. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade, but have a limited budget (less than $200) to spend. </s>
<s> I've been looking at ATI's Radeon 9800 Pro with 128 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> Is this a significant upgrade over what I have? </s>
<s> I just want to make sure I'm making a decent upgrade...meaning an upgrade that will speed up the newer games out there. </s>
<s> Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, BB </s>
<s> if u want cheaper, then go for 6600gt but the 6800 is better and well worth the xtra money. </s>
<s> Thanks for the recommendation. </s>
<s> However, I'd still like to know if it is a significant upgrade to go from my nVidia GeForce FX 5200 to an ATI Radeon 9800 PRO. </s>
<s> Are there any quantitative resources on the internet that compare how good video cards are stacked up against each other? </s>
<s> Again, any help is appreciated. </s>

<s> with going from Nvidia to ATi is the drivers switching and stuff...ur better off just sticking with Nvdia and getting the 6600GT </s>
<s> Your current video isn't slowing down its your gaming applications demanding more. </s>
<s> Getting a 9800pro is a step up &quot;chipset&quot; wise but its a dated chipset. </s>
<s> You're logical step-up with nVidea is the 6600GT and keeping with what the look and feel of nVidea setting. </s>
<s> Let's face it, if you want to get the best video, you got to spend the $$$ and then wait awhile, it'be old news. </s>
<s> Considering your $200 budget, having the 6600GT is a good bargain compared to yet upper level chipsets. </s>
<s> Beware though, sooner or later it'll be the bargain offering probably in a yr. as pricing drops and then another chipset will take its place within that pricing range. </s>
<s> FYI - Getting a more powerful video card, you need to prepare to have a decent power supply of at least 350W or better. </s>
<s> These new video cards are sucking the juice and if not taken care of will cause problems, system wide, if not shutdown or presistant reboots and/or BSDs. </s>
