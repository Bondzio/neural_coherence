The only part missing is a video card (I have a PCI card but I would rather use an AGP one). My motherboard accepts up to 4X AGP video cards. Although I found many of them, they are generally more expensive than 8X cards and also have less video memory. I also found that some 8X cards are backward compatible with 4X slots (some are even compatible with 2X slots). I would like to know if all 8X AGP video cards are backwards compatible with 4X. I really would appreciate any input and/or suggestions. Dimitri
