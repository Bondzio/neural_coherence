Hi all.
I have a Dell Dimension 3000, P4, 3.2GH, 1GB RAM, and would like to upgrade the CPU to a Pentium D or other dual-core.
I've never done a processor upgrade before...
I need to know 1) is this possible or even sensible?
2) which CPU to buy & where (best prices)?
3) show me where I can find step-by-step instructions?
Thanks!
