My hard disk and graphics card seem to get quite hot after only a few minutes of operation.
My PC has been suffering from overheating problems for a few weeks now and I have installed a new fan, but the problem still persists (the PC will turn off after things get 'too' hot).
My graphics card, is so hot that I can't actually touch it (in operation) without getting a slight burn!
The hard disk is not as hot, but still feels unnecessarily hot.
Is this normal?
The problem ceases when I use a household fan, so should I invest in a more expensive, more powerful fan?
If so, should it act as an 'exhaust' or should it blow in air?
I only have space for a fan at the back on the top, just under the PSU.
Apologies for the rather long post, and any help would be greatly appreciated Thanks, Marc
