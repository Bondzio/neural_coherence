1.1.1	My computer is 5 years old--p2/550--would an new soundcard (and speakers) make for better sound or is audio through a computer inherently poor?	St
1.1.2	I listen to college radio (the ones that stream @ 128k), mostly, and cd's.	St
1.1.3	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Your computer is quite old, it is barely worth spending money on a system that old, but, YES, you could definitely improve the sound dramatically by getting something like a Soundblaster Live with Quad speakers and a subwoofer, the difference would be dramatic and pretty incredible if you bought good speakers.	St
1.2.2	You can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future.	St
1.2.3	Speakers like the Cambridge SoundWorks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound.	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice.	St
1.4.1	I bought some speakers and it improved my music quality tons.	St
1.4.2	I purchased Ev Sonic Xs THe tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them.	St
1.4.3	With a 120 watt Subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong.	St
1.4.4	240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150.	St
1.4.5	But Bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound.	St
1.4.6	I have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power.	St
