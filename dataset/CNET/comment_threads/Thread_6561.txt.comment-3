Thanks for the lead Art, but actually, that post and replies are what prompted me to ask my Q.
While part of that discussion is about copying DVDs, I also need to understand if a compilation from many DVDs is possible, especially since the audio portion may be different on each song being copied.
Not sure if the finished product, even if possible, will sound right.
