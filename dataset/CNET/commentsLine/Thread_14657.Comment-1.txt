i have purchased two of the above monitors and have waited 4 months for my rebate.
based on what i have, read i guess i will never see it.
as to the quality of the monitor, it has performed without any problems for me and one other employee.
i am not picky about how true the colors are so i cannot comment on that subject, but functionally, it has been fine.
i have nothing to say that it is exceptional nor anything to say that is poor.
