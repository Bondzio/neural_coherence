1.1.1	I just got a Logitech optical marble mouse ( it really is a track ball } for my mother .	St
1.1.2	Everything loaded fine but what happened is the keyboard no longer works so she can not even sign in to get into windows .	St
1.1.3	The lights on the keyboard do not even light up .	St
1.1.4	I even tried another keyboard .	St
1.1.5	THe mouse works fine .	St
1.1.6	I unplugged the mouse and it still did not work .	St
1.1.7	I even restarted the computer with the Keyboard plugged in and out and still nothing .	St
1.1.8	She has a HP desktop , OS Windows XP , the keyboard came with the computer and it is a multi media one .	St
1.1.9	I even called Logitech and they told me to call HP .	St
1.1.10	That was a joke because they told me to call logitech all they did is to tell me to turn the computer off and on , which I had already did .	St
1.1.11	Anybody know what is going on ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	For XP , boot SAFE MODE and use system restore to before this install .	St
1.2.2	Logitech KNOWS the issue .	St
1.2.3	The fix is to not use the mouse software .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I just asked my mother if she used the software she asked me what software .	St
1.3.2	So she never used it .	St
1.3.3	I just went to help her because the keyboard was not working but the mouse was .	St
1.3.4	I assumed she used it because the mouse was working and it is not a brand new computer , so I knew she needed it , but apprently she did n't .	St
1.3.5	She told me she just did what the instructions told her to do and indeed she did because I just saw it .	St
1.3.6	No mention of the software , even though there is a disc..	St
1.3.7	It just states turn the computer off , plug the mouse in and turn it on .	St
1.3.8	Interesting so you are saying this is nothing new if I used the software .	St
1.3.9	Because they never even asked me if it was used..	St
1.4.1	Read http : //support.microsoft.com/ ? id=256233 I would follow the directions on this one .	Ques
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	The same procedure works for XP as well as system restore .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Wow you have got to be kidding me .	St
1.6.2	There s no way I can do that .	Res
1.6.3	But she never downloaded the driver .	St
1.6.4	I have a patch for something I do not even know how to use it so there is no way I can do it because I have no clue about any of this rebooting by a disc I am sure she does n't even have the disc for the computer anymore .	St
1.6.5	I am mad as h*ll .	St
1.6.6	There has to be another way .	St
1.6.7	I am not mad at you , You have been very helpful but I am so mad at Logitech I can spit .	St
1.6.8	And it is too late to call them now .	St
1.7.1	If that CD went anywhere near the machine ...	St
1.7.2	But at least you know about that keyboard filter issue .	St
1.7.3	For now try another keyboard ... Bob	St
1.8.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.8.2	I thought it was a short also .	St
1.8.3	Until I swtch the mouse into the port where the keyboard was and it worked I am going to see about one of those no frills Keyboards .	St
1.8.4	I 'll let you know what happens .	St
1.8.5	Thank you very much you helped a lot At the very least I know that Logitech is full of it and this is a well known problem , ABout the Cd I am going to bury it to make sure my mother does n't load it .	St
1.9.1	Good sleuthing on your part .	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	Viola !	St
1.10.2	it worked !	St
1.10.3	Ok a few weeks ago I had a problem with my DVD player .	St
1.10.4	It is one those that have 400 dvd 's in them .	St
1.10.5	So I had to input the name of most of the DVD 's I have a laptop so I had to go buy a a keyboard and the keyboard did not work .	St
1.10.6	It was one of those multimedia keyboards .	St
1.10.7	The Keyboard worked with my CD jukebox though so there was nothing wrong with it .	St
1.10.8	Since the DVD and CD are both Sony 's and they required the same keyboard something else was going on .	St
1.10.9	One of the requirements was the power input of the keyboard could not be over a certain number .	St
1.10.10	But like I said the CD player worked .	St
1.10.11	I looked all over for a solution , even here and someone said try and use just a regular keyboard not the multimedia one .	St
1.10.12	So I had to go and buy one of those and it worked !	St
1.10.13	I figure it could n't hurt and try that keyboard with my moms because there was no way I could follow that fix .	St
1.10.14	It meant bringing the computer somewhere to get it fixed .	St
1.10.15	And guess what it works ! !	St
1.10.16	It must have something to do with the combined power output with the mouse and the keyboard being too much if the multi-media one is used .	St
1.10.17	And when I used the regular keyboard without the bells and whistles the power input must of been less .	St
1.10.18	Just like the DVD player .	St
1.10.19	Unbelievable .	St
1.10.20	Now I got to go out and buy another keyboard .	St
1.10.21	It only cost 4 bucks lol .	St
1.10.22	I wonder if this would fix other people 's computer who have the same problem ?	Ques
1.10.23	I can not believed it worked .	St
1.10.24	I want to thank everyone for sticking with me with this , Logitech should be called to the carpet for this .	St
1.10.25	They are going to hear from me .	St
