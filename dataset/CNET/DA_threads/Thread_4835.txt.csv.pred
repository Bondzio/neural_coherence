1.1.1	my motherboard is asus model P4GE-MX.I replaced a 1.7ghz processor with a 3.06 processor .	St
1.1.2	The problem is that when I try to load the OS the system freezes which is not the case when I inset the old processor .	St
1.1.3	pliz help .	St
1.2.1	1. http : //discussions.virtualdr.com/showthread.php ? 219209-Dead-computer Post 9 repeats what I know .	St
1.2.2	2 .	St
1.2.3	I see you replaced the CPU but what about the power supply ?	Ques
1.2.4	That bump up will cause some spikes in the power draw that could crash the system .	St
1.2.5	3 .	St
1.2.6	That is also issues with freezes later in the case of both items 1 , 2 and if the heat sink and compound are not up to the job .	St
1.2.7	Often I find the old heatsink on the new CPU and folk wondering what happened .	St
1.2.8	Sometimes they need a lot of convincing .	St
1.2.9	Sadly that convincing is done by hours on the bill .	St

1.3.1	You need to visit the Asus support website and check your model # ( mtrbd . )	St
1.3.2	and thus reveiw what 's present .	St
1.3.3	Check the current CPU list of the what 's supported .	St
1.3.4	Plus , verify or check the current bios level you have .	St
1.3.5	This in turn also allows the latest supported CPU and/or additions that may not have been supported when your PC 1st came out .	St
1.3.6	This will greatly enhance the later CPU install as yours .	St
1.3.7	Also , you need to check the CPU specs and family ( class ) in or to best match similar CPUs .	St
1.3.8	Visiting the CPU maker support website will do that for ya .	St
1.3.9	If you check the stk # on the CPU itself , will zero-in on what you have , no guessing .	St
1.3.10	Once all that is accomplished you have a better understanding into the overall CPU supported and what if anything is n't .	St
1.3.11	Your new 3.09Mhz seems odd IMO , but then again if you review what is supported it may fit in .	St
1.3.12	Doing all this will provide what is anything is supported .	St
1.3.13	Alas , ther bios if it needs to be updated , will best provided by Asus , just be sure to get the right one .	St
1.3.14	All this on top of what Robert suggested as it applies .	St
1.3.15	Thus , this is amtter of sorting out the details as it were .	St
1.3.16	tada -- -- -Willy	St
