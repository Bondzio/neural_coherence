i've bought an lg dp1w with wifi recently.
i tried to connect my lacie 1tb harddrive to it, but it wouldn't recognise it.
the harddrive is in ntfs file system.
my friend has a wd harddrive connected to a wd multimedia player, and it works perfectly.
his harddrive has an ntfs file system as well, so this is why i get confused.
is it because his mm player and hd have the same manufacturer?
i know that you're going to tell me to format it to fat32, but i know that the max file size there is 4gb, and this is not a solution for me, because i bought it to watch hi-def films with it.
